Pres. Duterte to trap Cayetano today? Alan Peter still has way out,"Evidence suggests that President Rodrigo Duterte may have put Speaker Cayetano on the horns of a dilemma, between Scylla and Charybdis, between the devil and the deep blue sea, between a rock and a hard place. 

But before we go any further, let me state that the special sessions that President Duterte ordered  should be enough to pass the 2021 National Budget in the House of Representatives. That is, the nations primary concern, a COVID-19 budget, should not be a problem anymore, thanks to PRRDs intervention.


With that said, we can now discuss the secondary issue, the ongoing speakership war.

Lets start with the facts
Here's what happened so far:
1. The House holds regular sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesday .

2. Per the current legislative calendar mutually agreed upon by the House and the Senate , the suspension of session is slated on 17 October 2020, so there should be regular sessions on 12-14 October 2020 (Monday to Wednesday).

3. However, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano prematurely declared a suspension of session on 06 October 2020 , thereby cancelling the 12-14 October 2020 session days.

4. President Duterte views this suspension as illegal and unconstitutional .

5. Dutertes view is seconded by Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo publicly said Cayetanos move to suspend House Sessions is unconstitutional per Sec 16, Art VI, of the Constitution .

6. President Duterte issued a proclamation ordering special sessions on 13 to 16 October 2020 . Interestingly, these dates exclude Monday, 12 October 2020.
Interestingly, PRRD did not include, 12 October 2020, in the schedule of special sessions he ordered, and that decision may be a trap that can ensnare Cayetano.

What trap are you talking about?
Today, which is supposed to be regular session day, Speaker Cayetano has only two possible courses of action: 
1. Keep the suspension in place 

2. Lift the suspension and convene the House 
Lets elaborate.

CAYETANOS FIRST OPTION: KEEP SESSION SUSPENDED
If Cayetano decides to keep sessions suspended, that would be a cancellation of sessions on October 7th (Tuesday), October 8th (Wednesday), and October 12th (Monday, today). Hence, Cayetano would be openly defying President Duterte, who views this move as unconstitutional.

In short, if Cayetano keeps doesnt hold a regular session today, then thats Cayetanos de facto withdrawal of support for the Duterte Administration. If Cayetano does this, he loses any remaining opportunity to plausibly deny his loss of support for PRRD.

Imagine, the President and his chief legal counsel already said that what Cayetanos doing is unconstitutional but Cayetano still insists on doing it? The president repeatedly says that he hates being humiliated, and this brazen defiance on Cayetanos part qualifies as a humiliation.

Moreover, a majority of House members may still opt to convene today despite the suspension by invoking majority in numbers (power to the greater number) and the constitutional duty to pass the budget to meet a national emergency (the COVID-19 pandemic).

That is, Cayetano may try to prevent a session, but a session may happen anyway. And if a session happens, that will lead us to the next scenario.

SECOND OPTION: LIFT SUSPENSION, CONVENE 12 OCT 2020
If Cayetano decides to follow the Constitution by lifting the suspension and convenes a regular House session today per the legislative calendar, he opens himself up to the possibility of ouster from the speakership.

Reports indicate that at least 200 members (two-thirds) of the House are now backing Velasco . Add the fact that Velasco appears to have the backing of President Duterte himself  and his likely successor, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte .

Given PRRDs 91% approval rating this late in his term , Saras 2022 chances are quite rosy, so any administration-aligned congressman with an instinct for political survival will not be as defiant as Cayetano.

Case in point is the hastily conducted Sunday press conference in the House , attended by LRay Villafuerte (NP), Pidi Barzaga (NUP), Egay Erice (LP), Mike Defensor (Party-List Coalition), Prospero Pichay (Lakas), and Benny Abante (NUP).

After viewing that presser, I observed that all of the attendees dodged the speakership issue, except LRay Villafuerte and Benny Abante, who were vocally against a speakership change. Everybody sees Villafuerte as Cayetanos de facto right-hand guy so thats not surprising. Meanwhile, Abante belongs to the House Minority, so his stance isnt surprising either.


Moreover, whats more interesting is not a single cabinet official has come forward to defend Cayetano after the October 6th suspension of sessions.

That is, it appears that Cayetano and Villafuerte, after overplaying their cards, are on their own.

A Sliver of Hope for Alan Peter
Given the discussion above, there are three primary possibilities:

POSSIBILITY 1: Cayetano openly defies Duterte by keeping the suspension despite Dutertes view that its unconstitutional, which would eject Cayetano from the Duterte Coalition.

POSSIBILITY 2: The first possibility happens, then the majority of House Members proceed to hold a session and oust Cayetano.

POSSIBILITY 3: Cayetano lifts suspension and convenes session today, only to be ousted.

These three possibilities indicate that Cayetanos prospects are bleak. However, he may still have some hope in the numbers game.

While Velascos camp claims support of 200 congressmen, it is likely that the estimate is bloated, and that leads us to


POSSIBILITY 4: Cayetano convenes session today and remains as speaker.

To replace Cayetano, Velasco needs support from 153 out of 304 sitting solons. So far, only PDP-Laban, NPC, and the Party-list Coalition (led by Mikee Romero) has openly declared support for Velasco. In as far as numbers, PDP Laban has about 63 solons, NPC has 33, Party-list Coalition has 54. Combining the numbers of these three parties, we get 150.

Thats a total of 150 members, or about 3 short of the 153 required. Now, Inday Saras Hugpong ng Pagbabago has 3 solons and Pro-Duterte Partido Federal has 8 members, and that brings the total to 164, which would be more than enough to constitute a majority.

But even the bigger political parties suffering from varying degrees of factionalism. For example, PDP has a 4-member Zamora Faction that may opt to support Cayetano. There have also been a few defections over the past couple of years.

That is, Velasco may not get all the 164 votes from those congressmen listed. Worse, he may get less than 153, which would make his speakership bid fail.

Nacionalista is expected to vote mostly for its party-mate Cayetano. NUP, another large party, appears to be split on the speakership issue .

With that said, this may put the 19-member Lakas  headed by Majority Leader Martin Romualdez  in a very interesting position. With such numbers, Lakas may decide who becomes speaker, i.e. whether Cayetano remains or Velasco rises. 

Will Lakas be the clincher?
Let me spell this out for you.

Theres a pretty good possibility that Romualdezs Lakas may serve as the clincher vote. If Lakas supports Velasco, then Cayetano may be ousted. If Lakas supports Cayetano, Cayetano may remain as speaker.

With that said, Romualdezs recent announcement. i.e. speakership vote but only after budget deliberations, i.e. no speakership vote on Monday, is an interesting decision.

With that pronouncement, Romualdez enlarges his bargaining chip in the House Speakership race. Romualdez can leverage his partys potentially crucial 19 votes to gain more power in the House.

But then, Lakas-CMDs decision will be decided by the two primary factors:

First, the quality of Cayetanos offer and whether Velasco is willing match or exceed it.

A closely contested speakership race like this one means that the challenger may have to divide the power pie among fewer solons, as opposed to the incumbent which has to cater to the supermajority. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that Velasco will likely be able to match whatever Cayetano will offer to Lakas.

Second, the opinion of Lakas-CMDs leadership.

The ghosts of Cayetanos past may hound him. Lakas-CMDs incumbent chairman is Senator Ramon Bong Revilla Jr, whose past pork barrel-related incarceration was at least partly due to Cayetanos attacks . Meanwhile, senior Lakas member and former President Gloria-Macapagal Arroyo, to put it extremely lightly, is not exactly fond of Cayetano .

To cut the long story short, Lakas members at first glance appear to be thinking long and hard, but it seems like its just waiting for Cayetanos challenger to woo them a bit more.

The odds appear to be stacked against Speaker Cayetano, but he seems to have a reed-thin sliver of hope to slither his way out of this kerfuffle. 

Yes, Cayetano will likely fail to wiggle his way out of this, but it's not an impossibility.

Today will be a very exciting day for political observers like me.",RJ Nieto,10/12/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/10/pres-duterte-to-trap-cayetano-today.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Duterte's precarious hold on power and the future of the Liberal Party,"Being a Philippine President is like being the driver of the car called ""the Philippine Government."" Winning in 2016 is Duterte driver's license, but a license is not enough. 

Duterte also needs  fuel for the engines, and  lubricants to keep the car's parts from breaking down. He fuels the car with tax revenues then he lubricates its parts using political power so that other politicians  the car parts  follow his lead.

To be an effective president, Duterte needs a constant supply of funds (mostly via tax money) and political power (political influence). Unfortunately, the President is currently having difficulty securing both.


First, COVID-induced economic contractions mean lower tax collections. 

But lower revenues have a pretty straightforward solution: austerity measures coupled with loans until the economy gets back on its feet. Diminished influence, however, is much more complicated. 

Second, some of the President's supposedly staunchest allies are undermining his political influence.

Recent events indicate an attempt to decimate much of Duterte's political power (the ""government lubricant"") that will render him unable to make the government car run the way he wants.

For this nation's sake, I do not want that. I need to protect this President until his term ends in June 2022. 

1: Depowering a President 
Let's first talk about the basics. 

There are three basic methods to depower a president.

First is by the expiration of term of office. This one is obvious, so it needs no further discussion.

Second is by impeachment. This one is also obvious, so it needs no lengthy discussion. Note that Estrada, while impeached in the House of Representatives, wasn't convicted in the Senate. While the Senate impeachment trial did, instead, was to catalyze a coup d'etat, which we shall expound in the next method. 

EDSA Dos ended with Estrada leaving Malacanang.

Third is by coup d'etat, such as the removal of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 through the romanticized coup d'etat that EDSA Uno, more popularly known as the People Power Revolution. Another example is President Joseph Estrada, who was removed in 2001 through EDSA Dos and while an impeachment trial was still ongoing. 

President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo could have suffered the same fate in 2001 during EDSA Tres, but that attempt failed. Unlike the first two EDSA uprisings, critical power blocs like the military and the Roman Catholic Church supported the sitting government. 

EDSA Tres didn't work because it had no military support.

2: Depowering Rodrigo Duterte
Should President Duterte be concerned about these three methods?

No big deal here. Term expiration is not an issue because that's what the 1987 Constitution wants. 

Impeachment is highly unlikely. 

Duterte has at least nine senators who will mostly take his side, namely:  Pacquiao,  Dela Rosa,  Go,  Pimentel,  Tolentino,  Sotto,  Marcos,  Revilla, and  Villar. Conviction, which requires at least 16 senatorial votes out of the possible 24, is improbable.

A coup d'etat is also unlikely. 

Like President Arroyo, Duterte has coup-proofed his reign through  his aggressive courtship of the military , and  drastic diminution of the already diminished political influence of the Roman Catholic Church. With a politically defanged church and with significant military support, an anti-Duterte EDSA revolution won't happen. 

Remember when PRRD visit one military camp after another during the start of his term? That wasn't for nothing.


3: The Lame Duck
All three methods require Duterte to exit Malacaang, and we see that none of them pose a real threat against him. But leaving Malacaang need not always be an ingredient.

President Duterte can still lose power without the need for removal, and that's by turning him into ""lame duck"".

A lame duck is an official with political power so diminished that he's reduced to a ceremonial head, with other persons (or groups of persons) exercising actual power.

For example, days before US President Barack Obama stepped down in 2017, the Trump predecessor jested: 
""You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions "".
US President Barack Obama

Trump's 2017 win turned Obama into a lame duck in the same way Duterte's 2016 win turned President Aquino into the same. 

So why did I bring this issue up? 

4: The Anatomy of Political Influence
Is President Duterte at risk of losing significant power, significant enough to prevent him from controlling the Philippine Government Machinery?

The answer, right now, is yes.

Political influence comes from two primary sources: 
mass popularity, and,
support from political power blocs. 
But heres some bad news: history shows that mass popularity is indispensable only during the election season, but support from political power blocs is necessary for the rest of the term. 

For example, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo won the 1998 vice-presidency by a landslide  but her popularity charted new depths each year. Despite becoming more unpopular than her deposed predecessor Erap Estrada , she still managed to hold on to power until 2010 because she enjoyed the support of most major political power blocs. 

Arroyo deftly maintained support from the military.

Now, does Duterte enjoy the same?

The first ingredient is present: Duterte got a sky-high 91 percent approval rating in the September 2020 Pulse Asia Survey . 

The second ingredient, meanwhile, is derived from the Duterte Coalition, also known as ""Kilusang Pagbabago (Coalition for Change)"", which primarily consists of the following political groups:
Duterte's own PDP-Laban, which includes speaker hopeful Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco belongs,
Senator Cynthia Villar's Nacionalista Party (NP), which includes Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano,
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's Lakas-CMD, which includes Majority Leader Martin Romualdez,
Lakas-CMD breakaway group National Unity Party (NUP), which includes presidential son Paolo Duterte, and,
Danding Cojuangco's Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), which includes Senate President Vicente ""Tito"" Sotto
The Party-list Bloc, led by 1Pacman Rep. Mikee Romero.
Note that Big Business (read: the billionaires) is also a political power bloc, but most billionaires are aligned with one or more of the six political groups listed above.

Aside from running the Executive Branch, Duterte needs to keep the alliance supportive of his decisions, which was the case, at least until right after the 2019 midterm elections. 

5: Three Power Tussles over the Next Best Things
Every political party wants to get top positions in government. Since there can only be one Philippine President, they aim for the next best things: 
the Senate Presidency and, 
the House Speakership. 
Note that the Vice-presidency is also a top position but let's be honest here: the VP is just a ceremonial official for as long as the President is still alive and kicking. 

Members of Kilusang Pagbabago vie for these posts, and very public conflicts ensue.

Kilusang Pagbabagos first internal power tussle happened in 2016 when then-Senator Alan Peter Cayetano (NP) fought Senator Koko Pimentel (PDP Laban) for the Senate Presidency. 

Pimentel and Cayetano.

Pimentel prevailed . But as a compromise, Duterte later made Cayetano Foreign Secretary . ThinkingPinoy explained this 2016 drama in detail in the ""Duterte, Cayetano, Pimentel: Inside Info on the Senate Presidency"" Part One  and Part Two .

The second major power tussle was in 2018 when Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (LAKAS) snatched the speakership from Davao del Norte Rep. Bebot Alvarez (PDP Laban) . 

Recall this moment?

But despite these inter-party conflicts, all members of this Duterte Coalition sought Presidents blessing before they took any step.

Yes, the Executive shouldn't meddle with the Legislative, but Duterte isn't just a Chief Executive. Separate and distinct from this presidency is his chairmanship of the PDP Laban, the leading party within the Duterte Coalition. These bickering camps consulted Duterte as its coalition head and not as the Philippine President.

Duterte's ability to rein in these feuding parties is evidence of the second ingredient, the support from the political power blocs.

With two ingredients readily available (mass popularity and support from political power blocs), Duterte more easily advanced his 10-point socioeconomic agenda. For example, he used these ingredients to quickly secure congressional funding and approval for many projects listed in the ambitious Build Build Build infrastructure program .

The third power tussle wasn't as bloody, as it was when Senate President Koko Pimentel (PDP Laban) stepped down for Senator Tito Sotto (NPC), telling the latter that the leadership transition shall be implemented ""with the minimum disruption.""

We all hoped that the fourth power tussle, the one for the 2019 speakership, would follow the same tack as the third, but it didnt. And this is when the second ingredient  support from political power blocs  started to become a problem for Duterte. 

6: Cayetano announced Speakership Bid
Cayetano resigned from DFA in October 2018  and told media that he ""will seek the leadership position in the House . "" He then mounted a successful bid for the congressional seat in Cayetano bulwark Taguig's 1st District . Further boosting his speakership chances is the election of his wife Lani Cayetano as representative of Taguig's 2nd District , albeit not without controversy .

Yes, Cayetano announced his speakership ambitions in advance, but other parties in the Duterte Coalition didn't join the chorus.

Four candidates for the speakership emerged after the May 2019 Elections :
1. Taguig 1st Dist. Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano (NP)

2. Marinduque Lone Dist. Rep. Lord Allan Velasco (PDP Laban)

3. Leyte 1st Dist. Rep. Martin Romualdez (LAKAS)

4. Former speaker and Davao del Norte 1st Dist. Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez (PDP Laban)
As you may recall, Alvarez lost his speakership in 2018 via forcible ouster, so there were serious doubts as to whether he can regain the position, especially since many of the midterm representatives reelectionists, meaning pretty much the same ones who voted him out. 

Velasco, Cayetano, and Romualdez

The list of candidates was eventually reduced to Romualdez, Cayetano, and Velasco... and here's where things started to get messy. 

7: Congressional Mathematics
Two primary factors determine the speakership vote: 
 the general directive of each representative's political party, and,
 to a lesser extent, the preference of each representative. 
Note that the first is more important because overemphasis on the second means each congress member will vote for himself as the speaker, and thatll lead to nowhere. The House has hundreds of members, so solons prefer to vote along party lines to consolidate political power in the chamber.

Hence, the dominant party or dominant coalition usually gets the speakership.

What ""dominant party or dominant coalition""? 

PDP Laban is the dominant party with over 80 House members  so its likely to decide who becomes the next speaker which, at the time, appears to be Velasco. But 80-ish is not yet a majority in a House of over 300 members, so other parties with fewer members can band together to form a coalition that can outnumber PDP Laban.

That's what rival Romualdez did, because LAKAS has only a handful of House members .

The third hopeful, Nacionalista's Cayetano, has about 42 party-mates in the House. However, Nacionalista has a history of disunity, best evidenced by its having fielded three vice-presidential bets in 2016 (Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes, and Bongbong Marcos ), making the party look more like a hedge fund than a political force. 

These three 2016 VP Candidates (Trillanes, Cayetano, and Marcos) are from Nacionalista.

Nacionalista's tendency for intra-party factionalism strongly suggested that Cayetano, just like Romualdez, needed support from a multi-party coalition. Cayetano eventually got support from PDP Laban's 4-member Zamora Faction  and the 40-odd NUP . Cayetano has supporters, but nowhere near the number enjoyed (or claimed) by either Velasco or Romualdez.

Mid-2019 newsfeeds were filled with various solons claiming majority support for either Romualdez  or Velasco , leading many to believe that the real battle is just between them.

By late June, it appeared that Romualdez and Velasco are in the lead, with Cayetano trailing at a distant third. 

8: Cayetano threatens the Duterte Coalition
It would've just been a typical numbers game if the battle was only between Romualdez and Velasco. But Cayetano, despite having the least number of overt supporters, appeared to have been extra creative. 

In late May 2019, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte said Cayetano came to her ""with a veiled threat, that if she endorses Rep. Velasco for Speaker, he would break up the Duterte Coalition and this, he said, will affect the Presidential Elections of 2022 ."" 

Inday Sara and Alan.

Succinctly put, Cayetano threatened to destroy Duterte's political influence (the second ingredient) if Inday Sara endorses someone else.

Reinforcing that theory is Buhay Party-list Representative Lito Atienza statement in a July 2019 interview:

""That's what Congressman Cayetano has been bandying around, that he is supported by the cabinet and that in fact, the cabinet would react negatively against the president if Cayetano doesn't get his term-sharing idea ."" 


Atienza accused Cayetano of threatening Congress that the President Duterte's own cabinet will defy the Duterte if Cayetano doesn't get what he wants.

Atienza essentially said Cayetano threatened to take away the second ingredient  support from political power blocs  from the President, to weaken a cornerstone of the Duterte Presidency.

Cayetano's decision to paint himself as one of Duterte's staunchest supporters seems to have paid off, as the exodus of a staunch ally could be debilitating to Duterte, an exodus that he threatened to undertake if he doesn't become speaker. 

9: Cayetano through the years
Cayetano's threats to destroy the Duterte-led political alliance apparently weren't taken lightly, given the Cayetanos extensive history of destroying political alliances.

Cayetano entered national politics through his 2004 Taguig congressional in Taguig that was funded by that First Gentleman Juan Miguel ""Mike"" Arroyo. The relationship turned sour just two years later, after Alan accused Mike of stashing millions of dollars in a German bank account . That is, Alan ironically accused his financier of having stolen money that, two years prior, Alan could've benefitted from.

Cayetano relentlessly attacked the Arroyos for the next several years. Cayetano capitalized on his very public opposition to the unpopular Arroyos to win a senate seat in 2007 under the Nacionalista Party. He stayed in the party, supporting his sister and fellow Nacionalista Pia Cayetano's 2010 senatorial run and, by extension, the unsuccessful presidential aspirations of Nacionalista head Manny Villar.

Cayetano then joined the Liberal Party-led (LP) Team PNoy for his 2013 reelection bid. However, he bolted the alliance just two years later after LP presidentiable Mar Roxas ignored his vice-presidential  ambitions  and chose Leni Robredo for VP. 



Cayetano can't run for VP alone, so he had to find a running mate. Cayetano successfully wooed Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, then attacked his former LP allies  during the 2016 campaign period. I guess this didnt surprise erstwhile ally Arroyo .

Judging from these, Cayetano is either  the bastion of integrity and morality, or  a political butterfly on steroids. I guess President Duterte believes it's better to be safe than sorry, so he entertained Cayetano's 2019 speakership dreams despite the distant lead of rivals Romualdez and Velasco. 

10: Why is this relevant to Duterte?
PDP Laban by itself does not constitute a House majority, but Kilusang Pagbabago does. However, that coalition has three speaker hopefuls: Romualdez, Cayetano, and Velasco. The coalition leader breaks the tie in times like these, and that coalition leader happens to be PDP Laban chairperson Rodrigo Duterte.

In the end, coalition head Duterte allowed the term-sharing deal, where Cayetano is the speaker for 15 months, Velasco for the remaining 21, and Romualdez sits as Majority Leader for the entire three years. This means a speakership change in October 2020.

As a side note, Romualdez' decision to step back is a political masterstroke because he can comfortably get and keep the relatively uncontested but potent majority leader position, while tensions simmer (and boil over) between Speaker Cayetano and his giddy and anxious successor Velasco.

True enough, Romualdez looks so chill right now as Cayetano and Velasco metaphorically stab each other in the weeks leading to the theoretical speakership transition. 

This guy is a political genius.

But instead of keeping true to his word, Cayetano refused to honor the gentleman's agreement. I would've ignored this political brawl, if not for the fact that Cayetano getting his way could result in President Duterte becoming a lame-duck president.

I do not want that. I want to protect this President's hold on power until his successor replaces him in June 2022. 

But how will the President lose significant power if Cayetano remains speaker? 

11: Duterte outside the Kulambo?
Duterte himself brokered the term-sharing agreement, which he reaffirmed in late September 2020 when he intervened in the Cayetano-Velasco catfight. Multiple news reports [33, 34, 35] indicated that President broke the impasse by declaring that Cayetano should step down on 14 October 2020. 


Every Kilusang Pagbabago Coalition member expects the decision of its leader Duterte to be followed, but it appears not to be the case. A day after the meeting, Cayetano delivered a melodramatic congressional speech and offered to resign from his post, an offer that 184 solons reportedly rejected . 

After the award-winning stunt, Velascos camp threatened to declare the speakership vacant  should Cayetano refuse to step down on the set date, thereby forcing a vote for the speakership.

If Cayetano gets his way again, what we shall witness is a brazen defiance of Duterte's leadership over Kilusang Pagbabago. Such defiance will show that Duterte has lost much support from political power blocs, support that he used to enjoy unequivocally.

Don't get me wrong: the Duterte Coalition will mostly be intact, except that it might as well change its name to the Cayetano Coalition, being that Duterte will be little more than a ceremonial head, with the Cayetano Faction calling the shots.

That is an issue. 

I supported Duterte in 2016 so he can control the government, and I do not want a political butterfly on steroids to wrest that control from him. And that's what will happen if and when Cayetano manages to remain speaker past October 14. 

Remember this?

Yes, Duterte will remain President. He will still have mass popularity. But no, he will not have full control over government anymore, because most political power blocs would instead follow Cayetano. If Cayetano fails to keep the speakership, it doesn't necessarily mean that Duterte is still in full control. But if Cayetano manages to keep it, then that loss will be certain.

I supported Duterte so he can lead this country for six full years, but if he becomes a lame duck, then that six will be reduced to four.

I do not want that. 

12: The Future of the Liberal Party after Rody
But the issue can even go beyond 2022.

As a nation, I think we have grown sick and tired of the Yellows, as evidenced by Otso Diretso's resounding defeat in the 2019 midterms. I myself do not want to witness another Quirino Hostage Crisis, another MRT Scandal , another Mamasapano Massacre , another trumped-up Corona impeachment case , another Kidapawan Carnage , another tsunami of drug syndicates , another botched Yolanda rehab.

Even the Liberal Party is painfully aware that its chances in 2022 are slim.

But the survival instinct is inherent in any human organization. In the absence of a winnable presidentiable, the Liberal Party will do the next best thing: support a friendly and winnable non-ally, hoping that it will catalyze the dying party's political resurrection. 

As of this article's writing, potentially winnable candidates for 2022 are:
 Manila mayor Isko Moreno,

 Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte,

 Former senator Bongbong Marcos,

 Senator Bong Go, and,

 Senator Manny Pacquiao

 Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.
Multiple reliable sources say first-term mayor Moreno will likely opt for reelection and I seriously think he will because it's the path of least resistance. 

Duterte, Go, and Pacquiao are too Duterte-aligned to accommodate LP. 

Meanwhile, Marcos is LP's archnemesis, so that's a no go.

In short, LP's last hope is its former ally Cayetano. 

No replay, please.

Cayetano ditched Arroyo right before the 2007 elections. Cayetano ditched Aquino for the 2016 elections. If Cayetano manages to prove that he can defy Duterte, if he sees that he can independently exist in the political ecosystem, what will he do in 2022?",RJ Nieto,10/06/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/10/duterte-hope-liberal-party.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Cebu City's #COVID19 Crisis: A throbbing migraine for General Cimatu,"Latest data shows Cebu City has 3,987 cases  against a total population of 922,961 , translating to 4,320 cases per million residents, i.e., between Italys 3,948  and the UKs 4,511 .

Oddly, Cebu City registered 64 total deaths , translating to just 69 deaths per million, way below Italys 573  and UKs 632 .

If there are about as many cases per capita in Cebu City as in Italy and the UK, why is Cebu Citys mortality rate drastically lower than the two?

A potential explanation would be underreporting (e.g., COVID deaths reported as just pneumonia deaths), but the disparity between Cebu City and Italy/UK is just so vast, underreporting alone wont be enough to explain this phenomenon.

A possible additional explanation is that Filipinos are generally younger.

People age 65 years and up at significantly higher risk of mortality for COVID-19  while the median age is 24.1 years  for Filipinos versus Italys 46.5  and the UKs 40.6 . That is, Filipinos stricken with COVID-19 generally have more resilient bodies.

Note, however, that a young population is not necessarily a good thing.


Filipinos on the average live for 70 years , compared to Italys 82.5  and the UKs 81.1 , meaning Filipinos die over a decade earlier than Italians and Brits. Thus, its also possible that Cebu City has fewer COVID-19 DPM because many of Cebus elderly, who would have been at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, have already died over a decade ago from some other cause.

Moreover, the Philippine Healthcare System as a whole is indubitably inferior to Italy and the UK. Case in point, Cebu City ran out of hospital beds to accommodate COVID-19 cases on 11 June 2020 . While DOH Cebu City requisitioned additional beds, the fact remains that its medical workforce remains the same, potentially translating to a generally lower quality of care, as doctors and nurses divide their attention among more patients.


Regardless, I think its reasonable to expect Cebu Citys DPM to remain relatively low and nowhere near those of the UK and Italy, which the Health Department uses to claim the effectiveness of its COVID-19 response.

And thats a major problem because it doesnt take into account that Cebu Citys recovery rate, along with the rest of the Philippines, is shockingly low.

However, a slightly closer look at the numbers reveals a bad sign: the recovery rate is too low.

The median length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients outside of China is 4 to 21 days . Generously assuming a 21-day hospital stay, Cebu Citys a vast majority 2,319 cases as of 01 June 2020  should have already recovered 21 days later on 22 June 2020.

However, data shows only 278 recoveries out of Cebu Citys 3,987 cases, meaning Cebu Citys COVID patients remain very sick longer than other countries. These patients are likely to survive, but extended hospital stays imply more massive medical bills.


Such bills will be a burden for Filipinos because the Philippines has yet to fully implement Universal Healthcare , unlike Italy and the UK, that already have such systems in place since 1978  and 1948 , respectively.

All in all, I think its safe to say that Cebuanos have a higher chance of survival compared to those in Italy and the UK. However, survivors may want to brace themselves for years or even decades of misery because theyre more likely to face massive medical debt as a result of their hospitalization.

Given the sheer number of COVID-19 cases in Cebu, this dark reality may significantly affect the level of support among Cebuanos for this administration, so the pressure is on newly-appointed IATF-Cebu head and former Armed Forces Chief of Staff Roy Cimatu  to salvage the situation.",RJ Nieto,06/24/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/cebu-city-covid19-crisis-will-be.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
A short summary of the RTC decision on Maria Ressa's online libel case,"Here is a concise summary of Manila RTC Branch 46 presiding judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesas 37-page decision on People v. Maria Ressa et al., docketed as Criminal Case No. R-MNL-19-01141-CR for violation of Section 4(c) of R.A. 10175 (Online Libel).


FOR THE PROSECUTION:
RAPPLERS REYNALDO SANTOS in the 01 February 2014 Rappler article C.J. using SUVs of Controversial Businessman, accused BUSINESSMAN WILFREDO KENG of involvement in Human Trafficking, Drug Trafficking, Smuggling, Tax Evasion, and Murder.
People of the Philippines v. Santos, Ressa, and Rappler by ThinkingPinoy on Scribd


Keng tried to negotiate with RAPPLERS MARITES VITUG to publish a clarification or retraction, and Vitug assigned RAPPLERS KATERINA SABELINA FRANCISCO to write the article. Keng showed Rappler a PDEA certificate showing drug allegations are false, and Law Enforcement didnt even find enough justification to initiate an investigation on the murder, human trafficking, smuggling, tax evasion, and murder allegations.

Keng repeatedly followed-up with Rappler for seven months, but no article was published.

Rapplers Francisco seconded Kengs claims when she testified that she drafted a clarificatory story and submitted it to Rapplers editors, but it was never published.

Rappler did not only refuse to publish Franciscos follow-up article, but also refused to take down Santos article, leading Keng to file libel charges against Santos, RAPPLER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF MARIA RESSA, and RAPPLER CHAIRMAN BENJAMIN BITANGA.

FOR THE DEFENSE:
RAPPLER FOUNDER MA. ROSARIO CHAI F. HOFILEA testified that Rappler has a pool of several editors that reviews stories before theyre published. Hofilea said Ressa is the CEO and Executive Editor, whose job is to oversee the entire organization and worry about its financials.

Hofilea said Ressa isnt involved in Rapplers day-to-day operations. She further explained that Ressas Executive Editor position isnt equivalent to editor-in-chief in the newspaper and that Rappler has no editor-in-chief.

Hofilea explained that Ressa would typically consult with the other editors if an article involves a controversial story, and editors collectively decide what to do about it. Hofilea, however, said if theres a stalemate, Ressa breaks the tie.

The defense also showed a legal opinion from the NBI indicating that the offense has prescribed, i.e., Keng filed a libel case beyond the 1-year limit.

The defense decided against presenting Ressa and Santos.

SUMMARY OF COURT RULING:
An online libel conviction can be had if prosecution shows five  elements of online libel are present, namely:  defamatory statement,  publication,  identification,  done online, and  malice.


The first four elements can easily be shown with a glance at Reynaldo Santos 01 February 2014 Rappler article C.J. using SUVs of Controversial Businessman, and the main point of contention in this case is the fifth element, i.e. Malice.

ON MALICE
Malice per Yuchengco v. Manila Chronicle  is ill will or spite and speaks not in response to duty but merely to injure the reputation of the person defamed, and implies an intention to do ulterior and unjustifiable harm.

The Supreme Court in Disini v. SOJ  presumes malice if complainant is a private individual, and Wilfredo Keng is such.

But RTC went a step further when it ruled that actual malice, which Vasquez v. C.A. defined as knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not, is present in this case.

The RTC said:
Santos wrote the xxx article sans verification xxx. The article imputes various crimes upon xxx Keng which was sufficiently proven during trial to be untrue. xxx This utter lack of verification is contrary to the (journalistic) standard maintained by Rappler, as testified by Hofilea xxx.
The RTC said both Santos and Ressa were aware of the probable falsity of their claims, as Keng has already pointed out the inaccuracies and even provided Rappler with a PDEA certification. Despite this, both Santos and Ressa didnt publish the clarificatory article and allowed the libelous article to remain on the website.

The RTC said:
Any news organization who claims to adhere to accuracy, fairness, and balance in terms of reporting, would have retracted, or xxx, issued a clarificatory article if there have been some indications of falsity to its previous article. Both accused, however, did not.
ON PRESCRIPTION
Using an NBI legal opinion, Ressa argued that the lawsuit has prescribed, i.e., Keng sued after the time limit (one year after publication) was over.

RTC, however, rejected the NBI opinion because its just an internal NBI memorandum that does not bear weight in this case, as it is not relevant and does not bind the Court.

RTC, citing Panaguiton v. DOJ , said Act No. 3326  applies to the special law on Online Libel (R.A. 10175 Sec 4(c)), as it explained that online Libel carries a penalty of at least four years imprisonment, so the prescription period is 12 years.

ON LIABILITY OF RESSA AND SANTOS
RTC, citing RPC Art 360 , said both the author and editor or business manager are liable, adding that the editor or business managers duty to know and control the contents of the paper.

Hofilea claims Ressa is Rappler's CEO and Executive Editor but not an editor-in-chief. Still, RTC noted that Hofilea admitted that Ressa makes the ultimate decision during deadlocks, i.e., Ressa controls and approves Rapplers content.

RTC noted that per RPC Art 361 , a defendant should be acquitted if libelous statement is true and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends but neither Santos nor Ressa appeared to prove that ground for acquittal.

The silence of the accused should not be taken against him but per People v. Resano, a prima facie case from the prosecution, as is the case here, may warrant the accused to take the stand to refute the case, but neither Ressa nor Santos did.

RTC then ruled:
Judgement is hereby rendered finding accused Reynaldo Santos Jr and Maria Angelita Ressa GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt xxx and are each xxx sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from 6 months and 1 day xxx to six years xxx.",RJ Nieto,06/16/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/people-vs-ressa-short-summary-of-37.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#JunkTerrorBill: Fake Facebook Accounts linked to Fake Death Threat?,"University of the Philippines Los Banos student organization Defend UPLB announced on 07 June 2020  that it took down one of its posts after it supposedly launched an investigation on the matter. It was referring to an earlier post claiming that a #JunkTerrorBill protester received a death threat from an unidentified number, a screenshot of which can be seen below:


As we all know, the post above was used to justify claims of various camps that the Duterte Administration or its allies are threatening members of the opposition.

But a little sleuthing reveals that there's something really fishy going on.

A day later on 08 June 2020, Defend UPLB said :
Defend UPLB categorically denies any allegations of manufacturing death threats. We received the report from one of our volunteers and urgently released an alert as our standard procedure. However, we admit that there was lack of oversight on our part to vet the reports.
An Inquirer article dated 04 June 2020 describes DefendUPLB as a student alliance , so I do not understand how it would discriminate between ""allies"" and mere ""volunteers."" While I commend the organization for launching an investigation into the matter, I just find it odd that the organization's members appeared to have immediately disowned that ""volunteer"" when he, in fact, is a part of it.

In the same 08 June 2020 statement, Defend UPLB included a link to the ""Volunteer's Personal Statement "", which leads to a post by UPLB student Ray Silvestre Binas explaining his side of the story.



Here are some of Binas' significant claims in the lengthy personal statement:
Binas claims to have received an anonymous SMS threat from a number.
He disposed of some unneeded personal stuff on 26 April 2020, and his sister asked him, on that same day, if he'd like to dump his phone.
He agreed without realizing that the phone had the SIM for the Defend UPLB hotline.
The SIM Card hasn't received any calls or messages from anyone.
He hasn't loaded credits on his phone for a long time because it's his alternate SIM.
He claims that around 10 AM of 07 June 2020, he ""received a text message saying ""mamatay ka na"" received a text message saying 'mamatay ka na.'""
He said he was ""paralyzed with fear until the group chat of the Defend UPLB popped out on my notifications, and I cannot think of anything else but to report this matter to them.""
He said, ""someone from [his] alliance noticed that the exact phone number used to threaten me was the CRW hotline number last March.
The ""personal statement"" includes five photos:


1:A screenshot of the alleged SMS death threat from +639351220364, with time stamp 10:42 AM, 07 June 2020


2: A screenshot of an allegedly fake Facebook account with the name ""Binas Ray.""




3: A screenshot of Facebook image post of his supposed decluttering, which clearly shows ""26 April"".



4: Another screenshot of a 26 April 2020 Facebook image post of his supposed decluttering.

5: A screenshot of a random online article on how to clone phone numbers.



Fact-checking Binas
Binas claims he cleaned his flat on 26 April 2020, and only after then did he decide to dump the old phone, including the SIM card for Defend UPLB's hotline.

Defend UPLB has been using that number for its hotline no later than 16 March 2020, or when it announced  its Citizen Rights Watch project on Facebook, as shown below:


Given this, why would Defend UPLB allow who it considers as a mere ""volunteer""  and a college freshman at that  to handle a hotline that deals with such sensitive and dangerous topics?

Defend UPLB is arguably a high-profile organization after being featured multiple times in news outlets like Inquirer , Interaksyon , Bandera . The organization has also been featured in Rappler almost every month since 2014 .

Page after page of Rappler articles featuring Defend UPLB, with one published in 2014.
Such a high-profile organization with at least 6 years of experience would know better than to let an inexperienced volunteer handle such a critical task, right?

Moreover, considering that Defend UPLB has been in the news since 2014 and it repeatedly advertised the number on 17 March 2020 , 22 April 2020 , what are the odds that it hasn't received any SMS or calls for over a month, especially if the hotline is for reports involving harassment from the government?

Cloned SIM Card?
Recall that Binas claims somebody cloned his SIM and texted him using that cloned number.

But if Binas really did throw his phone and SIM into the trash, why would anybody bother to clone his number when one can just pick up the SIM and use it right away?

There's COVID-19 epidemic, so why would anybody go to the junkshop and expose himself to toxic waste just to get a SIM card when he can just buy a brand new one for next to nothing?

Is Binas, who Defend UPLB describes as just a ""volunteer,"" so outstanding that somebody with very sophisticated electronics skills will bother spoofing him?

If Binas mistakenly threw the phone and SIM away on 26 April 2020, why would Defend UPLB still advertise the number on 28 April 2020  and 01 May 2020 ?

Most importantly, Defend UPLB even advertised the same number on 02 June 2020  for registration of participants in its 04 June 2020 conference entitled ""Ensuring Campus Safety under the Anti-terrorism Bill,"" an event that apparently pushed through .
By dignifying Binas' personal statement, is Defend UPLB suggesting that the conference pushed through without them checking if anybody registered by contacting that hotline? Suppose Defend UPLB knew of the SIM card's loss, why didn't they announce it?

Are Binas and Defend UPLB basically saying that ""the dog ate their homework""?


Whichever way it goes, it appears that Binas and Defend UPLB are lying.


Data suggest that Binas received the SMS death threat from somebody in charge of Defend UPLB's hotline and that somebody could be Binas or one of his pals in the organization.

The Fake Facebook Accounts
On 07 June 2020, thousands of fake Facebook accounts popped up overnight, mostly spoofing names of Filipino university students, faculty, and alumni .

Note that the fake accounts aren't fully-populated profiles: no photos, no posts, no friends' list, and they contain only the name of the person impersonated, and most of the victims are students or school employees.

Like this.

Again, we know two things:
The fake accounts typically contain only a name and nothing else.
Most of the victims are connected to universities.
Hold on to that thought for now.

Defend UPLB is the same organization that started the Change.Org petition  entitled ""JUNK THE ANTI-TERRORISM BILL AND UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS!"", which garnered almost 800,000 signatures as of 08 June 2020.



Change.Org, where the petition is located, allows a petition's starter to download the list of all those who signed the petition, either in PDF or Excel format, as shown below:


The resulting list contains the signatory's name, location, and the date he signed the petition. The location may sometimes include the signatory's city or just the signatory's country. Suffice it to say, the only useful field there is the one containing the names.

Isn't it too coincidental that the Change.org petitions have nothing but the names, just like the fake Facebook accounts that everybody's been complaining about?


Isn't it too coincidental that Defend UPLB's primary audience is university students and faculty, and the majority of the fake Facebook accounts contain names of people from that same community?

And most importantly, which among these possibilities is most likely:
Somebody hacked a database other than the signatories list in Change.org, and that database coincidentally also focuses on schools, and the names were used to create the fake accounts;
Somebody hacked the database of this Change.org petition, and the names were used to create the fake accounts;
Defend UPLB, who already has access to the list of names, used the names to create the fake accounts
Well, Occam's Razor suggests that all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one.

I see the perfect opportunity for agitprop, the weapon of choice of many left-wing groups.

There is much ready-to-use software out there that can automatically create fake Facebook accounts using a database of real names. I won't teach you how to do that in this article, so I won't get into trouble.

The Weird Timestamps
Interestingly, Binas edited his personal statement on Facebook 13 times in about five hours.
His edits have the following timestamps:
3:59 PM  Original Post
4:01 PM  1st edit
4:01 PM  2nd edit
4:02 PM  3rd edit
4:03 PM  4th edit
4:04 PM  5th edit
4:06 PM  6th edit
4:11 PM  7th edit
4:17 PM  8th edit
4:22 PM  9th edit
4:22 PM  10th edit
5:13 PM  11th edit
6:56 PM  12th edit
8:38 PM  13th edit

Defend UPLB's post  that links to Binas' personal statement has a timestamp of 4:05.

Timestamps of the first six versions of Binas' personal statement, he edited his personal statement every minute (3:59 PM, 4:01 PM, 4:01, 4:02 PM, 4:03 PM, 4:04 PM), then the seventh edit is at 4:06. Nothing happened at 4:05, which is the exact time that Defend UPLB shared Binas' personal statement.


Given this, which among the following is most likely:
Binas, the inexperienced freshman, is also the administrator of Defend UPLB's Facebook Page;
Defend UPLB almost instantaneously shared Binas' personal statement after the latter published it;
Binas and Defend UPLB helped each other in crafting Binas' personal statement; or,
The 4:05 PM blip is purely coincidental
What's more interesting, however, is the 13th edit.

The original post until the 12th edit contains the sentence:
My family is already seeking the help of the authorities like the NBI and the network operator, which is TM to resolve this matter.
Then four hours later, Binas changed that sentence into:
My family is already seeking the help of the right authorities and the network operator, which is TM to resolve this matter.
Why did Binas decide to remove the phrase ""like the NBI,"" when the NBI should be the first authority he should consult? Does he intend to avoid the NBI at all costs? If so, why?

NBI, can you invite Binas and Defend UPLB's officers? You guys may want to ask them more than a few questions.",RJ Nieto,06/09/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/junkterrorbill-fake-facebook-accounts.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
NCR to GCQ with Duque: Data shows Duterte between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,"Did the Philippines make the right decision when it eased the lockdown on NCR, the country's coronavirus epicenter?

On 1 June 2020, the Philippines decided to relax lockdown measures in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the countrys COVID-19 epidemic. Public opinion on this decision is mixed. Some say its too early as the coronavirus is still beyond the governments control, while others say the government has successfully flattened the curve.

In this article, we will examine the wisdom of this decision (or the lack of it), by comparing the Philippines to other countries that have significantly relaxed their lockdown measures and how the number of daily active cases changed afterward.

To further explain this papers methodology, let me start by discussing the rationale behind a COVID-19 lockdown.

The spread of disease starts when the first infected individual (Patient Zero) enters a country and gets into contact with its erstwhile COVID-free population. The spread begins slowly at first because still few are contagious. However, the spread accelerates as more people become carriers, and the total number of infected individuals increases exponentially, generally following a logistic growth curve.

COVID-19 will not have been much of an issue if a tried-and-tested antiviral is available. However, its not the case, as vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions are still in highly experimental stages.

If a scantily understood but contagious disease like COVID-19 is allowed to spread unabated, theres a high likelihood that the number of infected will overwhelm a countrys healthcare system. And when demand breaches supply, mortality rates rise. After all, a COVID-19 victim is far less likely to survive without medical attention.

Flattening the Curve, Raising the Line
By this time, most people are already aware of Flattening the curve, a public health strategy focused on slowing the spread of disease to keep healthcare demand within the capacity of a countrys healthcare system.

Usually, flatten the curve involves pharmaceutical interventions that mitigate or eliminate the disease. But COVID-19 antivirals are unavailable right now, so governments resort to non-pharmaceutical interventions that focus mainly on vector control, or restricting contact between persons, thereby reducing the likelihood of coronavirus transmission.


That is, governments focus on prevention since there is no cure yet.


COVID-19 vector control measures include (a) closing down of schools, (b) isolation of the elderly and those with co-morbidities, (c) self-quarantine of suspected and confirmed cases, (d) social distancing, and in extreme cases, (e) a lockdown, i.e., the forcible home quarantine of a vast majority of the population.

Complementing Flattening the Curve is Raising the Line, where the line represents the countrys healthcare capacity.

Raising the line includes increasing the number of hospital beds, medical personnel, and medical equipment. For example:
The Philippine Government has converted various public buildings into ad hoc COVID-19 treatment facilities, thus increasing the number of hospital beds.
Philippine Senator Bong Go, on the other hand, seeks the creation of a Medical Reserve Corps, aimed at increasing the number of medical personnel.
The #PPEniTP Project, a partnership between Thinking Pinoy and the Filipino-Chinese Community, provides essential personal protective equipment (PPE) to COVID-19 frontliners, helping make medical equipment more available.
Of course, limitations on resources mean The Line cannot be Raised indefinitely, so most governments put a greater emphasis on flattening the curve, hence the lockdowns.


Oxfords Government Response Stringency Index
Most countries enforce some form of lockdown, but the severity of such policies varies widely, making it challenging to compare performance data between two different jurisdictions.

To address this, the University of Oxfords Blavatnik School of Government created the COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index, which the website defines as:

The Government Response Stringency Index is a composite measure based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest response).

More specifically, the index is based mainly on nine policy and response categories, namely:
School closures
Workplace closures
Canceling public events
Restrictions on gatherings
Public transport closures
Public information campaigns
Stay at home
Restrictions on internal movement
International travel controls
Take, for example, the index for the United Kingdom, as shown below:


As can be seen above, the UK started to enforce drastically stringent policies until 23 March 2020, which coincides with when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the country under a virtual lockdown.

From the same graph, we can also see a significant relaxation on 13 May 2020, which coincides with the easing of the UK lockdown as data shows economy (was) hit.

Focusing on the Philippines
Now, lets look at the Philippines:


President Duterte declared a Luzon-wide lockdown in mid-March, which explains the rise in Stringency in the graph. A sudden drop in Stringency occurred on 01 May 2020, or when it started enforcing a General Community Quarantine (GCQ) in select parts of the country.

The graph shows lockdown policies are still pretty strict for the Philippines, but Stringency will drop drastically as Metro Manila and Central Luzon transitioned to GCQ on 01 June 2020.

Significant Policy Relaxation
High Stringency flattens the curve, but when applied for too long, it also flattens the economy.

Of course, no government wants its people to survive from COVID-19 just to let them die from hunger. Hence, governments change Stringency to balance Public Health and Economics. Such changes affect the rate of spread of disease. The bigger the change in policy, the bigger the difference in the rate of spread of disease.

The Philippines, as explained previously, has enforced its second significant policy relaxation on 01 June 2020 when it let Metro Manila transition to GCQ.

Was this the right thing to do? Thats the question.

Of course, there are many ways to define a significant policy relaxation based on the Stringency Index. But for this article, we shall set it as the date where the Stringency decreased by 9 points or more from its highest peak. A more optimal value may be found, but 9 points suggest at least one minor relaxation in each of the nine indicators or a significant easing in one or more.

More formally stated:

Let S be the Stringency at date x. We define peak date P as the latest date at which S is at its maximum, i.e.:
P := maximum { d | S (d) = maximum {S} }.
Further, we define significant relaxation date R as the earliest date after P where S decreased by more than 9 (S > 9), i.e.:
R := minimum { d | S(p) - S(d) > 9; d > p}.
That is, a Significant Policy Relaxation happens on date R.
Many countries have yet to significantly relax policies so that their Rs may not exist, but we are just concerned with those that have already done so. Using data from Oxfords Stringency Index, the table below lists down countries that have significantly relaxed policies (S > 9).


The Philippines is not the first country to significantly relax policies, as the table above shows 14 others who have done so in the past, but did the Philippine make the right decision to follow suit?

Active COVID-19 Cases
Recall that flattening the curve and raising the line are both aimed at keeping the total healthcare demand within the limits of a countrys healthcare system, but how do we get an idea of aggregate demand?

In an interview, infectious disease specialist Dr. Edsel Salvana of the UP Manila National Institute of Health used doubling time as a gauge, which he defines as the number of days it takes for the cumulative COVID-19 cases to double.

Doubling time is a very reasonable indicator of aggregate healthcare demand. Still, this metric is essentially the first derivative of the epidemic growth curve, making it less readily correlatable to healthcare demand.

As an alternative, this article uses total current active COVID-19 cases, as it arguably directly correlates with a countrys aggregate healthcare demand. After all, a fully recovered COVID-19 case likely wont need much medical attention.

In this light, here are histographs of active cases of each of 15 countries with significantly relaxed policies, as listed in the previous section.

Data for active cases come from the Worldometers Coronavirus Tracker. The histograph titles contain the name of the country and the date of significant policy relaxation R, with red vertical lines denoting Rs approximate location.




Based on these histographs, active cases in 12 out of 15 countries with significant policy relaxations have fallen or plateaued. The three remaining countries  the Philippines, Indonesia, and Pakistan  have significantly relaxed policies despite respectively experiencing a continuous rise in active cases.

The Philippine Dilemma
Exacerbating the Philippine Pandemic is the accelerated growth in active cases over the past several days. The Philippine Health Department said the spike is attributable to late reporting, but the fact remains that total active cases undeniably continue to rise.

And this is a problem.

Continuously rising active cases mean its just a matter of time before demand breaches healthcare capacity. If and when that happens, mortality rates increase as COVID patients spill on the streets.

The Philippines has arguably slowed down the spread of COVID-19 through Stringency measures, but the more important question is whether it has restricted it enough.

It appears that it didnt. Worse, data suggest that the rise is accelerating.

Given that the curve didnt flatten enough, the remaining option is to raise the line.

That is, given the failure to sufficiently control healthcare demand, the government will have no other recourse but to increase healthcare capacity. But it is uncertain as to how long the government can sustain this, as it will only manage to strain the countrys already strained resources further.

Case in point, the national budget has been realigned to the nations COVID-19 response.

Raising the Line, but not that much
While the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the Public Works Department are doing an excellent job building new COVID-19 facilities, the fact remains that the country has nowhere to get more medical personnel and equipment.

Worse, the countrys medical workforce is shrinking, as evidenced by the Philippines coronavirus infection rate among healthcare workers.

Abdi Mahamud, the World Health Organizations COVID-19 incident manager for the Western Pacific Region, said health workers comprise as many as 13% of cases in the Philippines, which he attributed to the PPE shortage and levels of coronavirus exposure.

Even at the onset of the pandemic, most Philippine hospitals already lack not only doctors and nurses but also PPEs, so just imagine how much worse it will be as the number of active cases rise further.
Three basic options

There are three primary courses of action left for the government:
Lower Stringency: further relax policies
Maintain Stringency: continue with the status quo
Raise Stringency: reinstate the lockdown
The first option is obviously off the table for the time being, so lets skip to the second.

As explained in previous sections, maintaining the significantly relaxed policies post-May will ultimately result in higher mortality rates.

A vast majority of COVID-19 patients will recover, and the nation will ultimately still survive. However, (a) a large number will likely die, a number that many Filipinos will likely perceive as unnecessarily larger due to lack of healthcare, and; (b) many of those who will triumph over the sickness will inevitably undergo torturous near-death experiences, which they will likely blame on the government.

The Health Department can try to hide cases as it did during the Dengvaxia Fiasco, but hiding bodies, given the far greater magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic compared to the 2017 Scandal, will be an impossible task.

And when people see bodies pile up, people get angry.

President Duterte may manage to at least partially assuage unrest by terminating Health Secretary Francisco Duque. Still, he remains reluctant despite massive clamor from both sides of the political fence, the healthcare community, and the general public.

That is, maintaining the relaxed status quo will likely result in a political nightmare for the Duterte Administration and whoever it will anoint as a successor.

Meanwhile, the third and last option  reinstating the lockdown  may save lives but ultimately cause economic devastation and, subsequently, massive civil unrest as the masses starve.

The President is between the devil and the deep blue sea, and the Filipino People fervently wish him success, which is more easily achievable if his Chief Public Health adviser Duque has competence, which unfortunately isnt the case.

Mr. President, Good Luck and Godspeed. May the Force be with You.",RJ Nieto,06/02/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/NCR-GCQ-DUQUE-DUTERTE-OXFORD.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#DrilonOnCNN: A case for firing fact-checker Vera Files,"Vera Files' latest fact-checking stunt on the issue of Senator Franklin Drilon's CNN interview should be a ground for its expulsion from its ""fact-checker""-ship.
Vera Files is among Facebooks fact-checkers in the Philippines, and I checked how it became so.

Facebook in its official help page  said it work(s) with third-party fact-checkers who are certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to help identify and review false news, a claim seconded by Poynter Institute with a related announcement.

Given these, I can only deduce that some Facebook chose fact-checkers from the roster of IFCN members.

But what are the requirements for IFCN membership?

Quoting IFCNs Code of Principles, each member needs to commit to several things, including (a) Transparency of Sources, (b) Nonpartisanship and fairness, and (c) Transparency of Funding.

Vera Files is an IFCN member, and this article, without prejudice to possible legal action against Vera Files, will discuss why it shouldnt remain so.

VERA FILES AND DRILON'S CNN INTERVIEW
Vera Files 07 March 2020 article VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Jay Sonza, RJ Nieto help propagate wrong claim that Drilon snoozed in CNN PH interview starts with:
Former broadcaster Jay Sonza and blogger RJ Nieto, both known for their pro-administration stance, amplified a false claim that Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon snoozed in the middle of a television interview.
Vera Files used blogger to describe this articles writer, RJ Nieto, conveniently omitting that hes also a journalist through his daily political commentary radio show Karambola sa DWIZ and the weekly column Thinking Pinoy at the major broadsheet Manila Bulletin. Moreover, Vera Files described both as pro-administration, which is irrelevant to the question of whether Senator Franklin Drilon snoozed or not.

Vera Files must be aware of these omissions because (a) Vera Files in the same article fact-checked a video posted on the Thinking Pinoy Facebook page, whose logo since September 2019 includes superimposed miniaturized logos of DWIZ 882 AM and Manila Bulletin; and (b) Vera Files in its fact-checks supposedly adheres to the Philippine Press Institutes Code of Ethics, part of which states:
I shall scrupulously report and interpret the news, taking care not to suppress essential facts nor to distort the truth by omission or improper emphasis.
This is a blatant attempt of Vera Files to poison the well as they consciously offer irrelevant adverse information and, at the same time, omit material facts about the person theyre fact-checking.

Here's Thinking Pinoy's logo that it has been using since September 2019:


Heres a question:
If a rabid opposition supporter shoots me in the head after reading this Vera Files article, will my being a newspaper columnist and radio broadcaster make my death count as a journalist killing?
The same assailed article then went on to claim that:
Sonza and Nieto both have a history of purveying misleading information on social media.
In the fact check article, Vera Files hyperlinked the phrase purveying misleading information to another Vera Files article , strongly suggesting that the claim against Nieto is supported by the said link.

A look at the links target, however, shows that its a 14 November 2018 fact check about Sonza and Sonza alone. That is, Vera Files claim that Nieto has a history of purveying misleading information on social media is not just an extraordinarily heavy allegation, but also an allegation that is failed to be supported by facts.

Fact-checking Nieto
Vera Files, in the assailed article, directed the readers attention to the 02 March 2020 Thinking Pinoy Facebook Live Video entitled FACT CHECK: DID SENATOR DRILON FALL ASLEEP IN A CNN PHILIPPINES INTERVIEW?, where it quoted:
Nakatulog siya momentarily, mga a span of five, ten seconds. Ngayon, medyo nakakahiya nga yon. Pero feeling ko, ano yan, may sakit si Drilon. Baka, ano, narcoleptic, ewan ko. Medyo hindi normal yon eh, kasi, immediately before atsaka immediately after nung pagtulog niya, dilat na dilat naman siya. Pero kahit na, nakakahiya pa rin.
(He fell asleep momentarily, for a span of five, ten seconds. Now, thats indeed kind of embarrassing. But I feel like, Drilon is sick. Maybe narcoleptic, I dont know. What happened is not normal, because immediately before and after he dozed off, his eyes were wide open. Nevertheless, that is still embarrassing.)
Nieto uttered these words at the 2:55 mark, as shown in the link below:


https://www.facebook.com/TheThinkingPinoy/videos/3401184933231084/?t=175

Vera Files, however, conveniently omitted what Nieto said at the 4:18 mark, which was:
So ang tanong, Nakatulog ba si Drilon o hindi? Well, judging from the video ng CNN mismo, mukha ngang nakatulog.
(So the question Did Drilon fall asleep or not? Well, judging from the CNN video itself, he really looks like he fell asleep.)
Check this via the link below:

https://www.facebook.com/TheThinkingPinoy/videos/3401184933231084/?t=258

Nieto was referring to timestamp 11:55 of Drilons CNN interview, as shown below:


Now, does that look like hes fully awake the entire time? How would an average reasonable person interpret what he saw? Is it false to say that Drilon looked like he was sleeping when his head was bowed down for an inordinate amount of time?

Additionally, Vera Files all-too-conveniently omitted the readily observable fact that CNN host Pinky Webb laughed momentarily during those moments and even decided to repeat the question to Drilon.

Quoting what Webb said, verbatim, during the same time Drilon supposedly fell asleep:
(Webb, staring at the void) There is a joint resolution, aside from the letter that was signed by Congressman Alvarez and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano (Webb shifts gaze to Drilon, momentarily giggles and smiles, then raises her voice) Joint Resolution, which I already asked your chief of staff, sir (giggles, squirms) Theres a joint resolution, theres a concurrent resolution youve sub youve authored both
Webb, who rarely stutters, had to stutteringly repeat the question to Drilon, especially the parts said while Drilon was bowing down. Drilon is one of the most intelligent senators out there, so why would Webb feel the need to repeat the question if Drilon was fully lucid?

In this interview, Webb maintained a congenial tone, but she never definitively smiled. That is, until the 11:55 mark when she saw Drilon bowing down.

A VERY CONVENIENT OMISSION
Vera Files then went on to say:
Drilon did not fall asleep at any time during the interview.
VERA Files obtained from CNN Philippines a screen grab of the clip without the character generator (chargen) -- the graphics placed on the bottom portion of videos -- that shows Drilon not sleeping, but looking at the documents on the table in front of him.
Vera Files included this graphic that includes a snapshot from raw footage, which is not publicly available until Vera Files published it.

Vera Files' logic is problematic on at least two grounds:

[a] Vera Files expects Nieto to see the invisible, as CNN Philippines live broadcasts contain character generator graphics overlays, and theres no way to see whats behind them.

[b] Vera Files basis for claiming Nieto propagated a falsehood relies on a false premise, as Nieto clearly qualified the limitation of his observation. Specifically, Nieto said he based it on what he saw in the live video (which has overlays), and not the raw video used as a basis by Vera Files.


Vera Files then attempted to buttress its observation by quoting Webb as having tweeted:
Heres what happened. As I was laying the premise for my question, I saw Sen Drilon look down at the documents he had on the table. I did not see him fall asleep.
If all Webb saw was Drilon looking at documents, then why would she have to  giggle,  raise her voice,  repeat the question,  giggle again, and  squirm?


Moreover, does the presence of documents in front of Drilon make it impossible for him to fall asleep?

IFCN MEMBERSHIP STANDARDS
Recall that IFCNs Code of Principles requires Vera Files to commit to (a) Transparency of Sources, (b) Nonpartisanship and fairness, and (c) Transparency of Funding.

To ensure compliance, IFCN requires Vera Files to re-apply for membership yearly by answering a questionnaire, so lets fact-check Vera Files answers in its 2019 IFCN application form.

Lets fact-check the parts relevant to the Drilon Issue.

IFCN CRITERION 3A: SOURCES POLICY
The question under Criterion 3a: Sources Policy reads:
Please share a brief and public explanation (500 words max) of how sources are provided in enough detail that readers could replicate the fact check. If you have a public policy on how you find and use sources for your fact-checking, it should be shared here.
Vera Files answer includes, among other things:

FIRST, Vera Files said, Hyperlinks to resources used its fact checks are provided within the text, and that, VERA Files follows a three-source policy for news reports and clearly states that at least three media networks used the same quote, or reported the event or incident.

This claim is false, as the sentence Sonza and Nieto both have a history of purveying misleading information on social media, does not have a reference to support Nietos alleged history of purveying misleading information.

SECOND, Vera files said its policy on sources is found in What you want to know about VERA Files Fact Check, and that article states:

[a] In the spirit of transparency, we provide the links to the sources of the statement and the evidence that are presented in the article.
Vera Files failed to do this, as explained earlier.
[b] As a news media organization, we strictly adhere to the professional and ethical standards set for journalists such as those found in the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics (PPI)

The SPJ Code of Ethics includes the following:


 Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing, or summarizing a story.
It has been shown in the previous sections that the assailed fact-check article oversimplified and misrepresented the story when it willfully omitted crucial details in the CNN interview and Nietos Thinking Pinoy video, while including unsupported, irrelevant, and libelous claims about Nietos character.
 Diligently seek subjects of news coverage to allow them to respond to criticism or allegations of wrongdoing.
Vera Files never contacted yours truly.
 Provide access to source material when it is relevant and appropriate.
See [a].
 Avoid stereotyping. Journalists should examine the ways their values and experiences may shape their reporting.
Vera Files stereotyped Nieto as pro-Administration, despite the fact that Nieto very frequently and quite harshly criticizes Administration-aligned figures, including Information Technology Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, Health Secretary Francisco Duque, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, and Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy,  to name a few.

IFCN CRITERION 2B: NONPARTISANSHIP POLICY
The question under Criterion 2b: Nonpartisanship policy reads:
Evidence required: Please share evidence of your policy preventing staff from direct involvement in political parties and advocacy organizations. Please also indicate the policy your organization has as a whole regarding advocacy and supporting political candidates.
The response? VERA Files nonpartisan policy is stated in What you want to know about VERA Files Fact Check, which, in turn, states that Vera Files doesnt take money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

This claim is false because Vera Files has been getting funding from the US Department of State-funded CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Annual funding since 2016 totals US$ 272,600 so far, US$ 75,000 of which was granted in 2019.

A screengrab of NED's grants to Vera Files per NED website.

NED itself describes its origins with this statement:
When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly.
Given this, I believe that I need not explain further how NED qualifies as a partisan group.

This funding source may be an even bigger cause for concern in as far as Vera Files claims of nonpartisanship because the Duterte Administration is at loggerheads with the United States, which is best exemplified by the recent cancellation of the Visiting Forces Agreement.

How can Vera Files be expected to write anything against the United States when it sources its funding from US-funded NED whose job is to wage the battle of ideas at international forums?

Note that a vast majority of Vera Files fact-checks are about Administration-aligned figures, as evidenced by its answers in Criterion 2a: Body of work sample, which asks for a list of ten fact checks that better represent the scope and consistency of Vera Files fact-checking.

Seven of the ten listed are against administration-aligned figures (2: Angara, 3: Chong, 5: Ong, 7: Enrile, 8: Duterte, 9: Locsin, 10: Andanar), and the only opposition-aligned figure in that list is a blogger and not even an opposition official.

Case in point, Vera Files has yet to fact-check anything about opposition stalwart and Magdalo Senator Antonio Trillanes, and the Public can't help but wonder if Vera Files head Ellen Tordesillas' close personal and professional relationship with a Magdalo party member has something to do with it .

WHAT SHOULD BE DONE
FIRST, Vera Files should practice what it preaches, something that it sorely failed to do in the assailed Sonza-Nieto article.

SECOND, Vera Files should issue an erratum to acknowledge the false and libelous statements it propounded in the same.

THIRD, Poynter-IFCN should review Vera Files compliance with membership requirements, as the above discussion clearly demonstrates that the latter forwarded false claims in its application.

I would like to believe that many of Poynter-IFCNs administrators believe that the organizations true goal is to help combat the proliferation of fake news. Unfortunately, it appears that no less than one of its supposedly esteemed members, Vera Files, is guilty of it.",RJ Nieto,03/09/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/03/drilononcnn-case-for-firing-fact.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
In the service of the Filipino? How ABS-CBN's Lopezes used mass media since World War II,"Davao businessman Dennis Uy recently asked President Rodrigo Duterte for a sovereign guarantee to cover a Php 700 million loan for Uys Chelsea Logistics. Eyebrows rose, of course, including those of Bayan Muna chairperson Neri Colmenares.

A Sovereign Guarantee is a Government assurance that it will pay loans should the original debtor fail to pay them. That is, a sovereign guarantee means taxpayers will pay Chelseas loans if Chelsea fails to, after all.

Yes, I do understand the uproar, but, but I believe its still premature. For one, Malacaang has not even considered Uys request yet. Uy asked for a sovereign guarantee, but the President has not yet given one.

Besides, I sincerely doubt that Uy is a Lopez.

Wait! What? ABS-CBNs Lopezes again? Yes, those Lopezes again.


LOPEZ, BENPRES, AND NLEX
In an interview with DWIZ, former ABS-CBN journalist Jay Sonza accused the Lopezes of deliberately helping machinate the downfall of President Joseph Erap Estrada, after Erap declined the Lopezes request for a Sovereign Guarantee.

Sonza said:
Noong nakuha ng Benpres ang NLEX, itong North Luzon Expressway, kailangan nila (Lopezes) ng foreign funding para sa expansion, saka maintenance, modernization. E hindi sila makakuha ng funding kung hindi magkakaroon ng Sovereign Guarantee.
TRANSLATION: After Benpres acquired NLEX, the North Luzon Expressway, [The Lopezes] needed foreign funding for its expansion, maintenance, and modernization. But they cant get funding without a Sovereign Guarantee.
Benpres Holdings Corporation, now known as Lopez Holdings Corporation, is the parent company of all Lopez-owned firms, including ABS-CBN Corporation.

The BenPres building in Ortigas Center
Sonzas claim that the Lopez Group was in dire financial straits appears to be backed by a 2011 expose from veteran columnist Neal Cruz.

According to Cruz, the Lopez Group defaulted on Php 1.6 billion worth of behest loans from the government-owned Development of the Philippines, namely:
1. Maynilad, when it borrowed Php 710.86 million in 2000 then defaulted in 2003 after Maynilads balance sheets went Php 5.2 billion in the red. Maynilad, at the time, was 59.1% owned by the Lopez Family via Benpres Holdings.
2. BayanTel, when it borrowed Php 591.81 million in 1995 then started failing to amortize in 2001, when the outstanding balance was at US$ 11.2 million.
3. SkyCable, when it borrowed Php 207.10 million in 1997 and became past due in 2001.
4. Benpres Holdings, when it borrowed Php 157.95 million in 1996 and went past due in 2002 when Benpres stopped paying.
All these loans were written off. As to why, Id rather reserve that discussion for another article because this one is already very lengthy as it is.

LOPEZ FIRMS ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT
As you can see, three of the four loans were secured on or before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, which resulted in massive currency devaluations throughout the region. The Philippine Peso traded at 30 to a dollar in August 1997, then it exploded to Php 42 just five months later in January 1998. The peso continued to nosedive and by October 2000, the exchange rate was at Php 50.

The Lopezes earned in pesos and not dollars, so the dismal exchange rate caused their dollar-denominated loans to balloon to levels that crippled Bayantel and Maynilad.
A firm thats deep in the red in on a race against time: it has to start turning a profit before it goes totally bankrupt. Loans can give troubled companies more time to fix their act, but how can financial institutions lend to the broke?
The answer is simple: sovereign guarantees. If a loan is has government-backing, then theres little risk of default because taxpayers will, by law, shoulder the loan if the company defaults.

And according to Sonza, thats precisely what the Lopezes aimed for.

In the same DWIZ Interview, Sonza said:
Pinipilit si Erap na pumirma ng Sovereign Guarantee. Inayawan ni Erap. O e di inumpisahan si Erap hanggang matanggal.
TRANSLATION: They were egging Erap to sign the Sovereign Guarantee. Erap refused, so they started on Erap until he was deposed.

SONZA: LOPEZ ASKED ERAP FOR SOVEREIGN GUARANTEE
Sonza added:
Iniyawan niya yung Sovereign Guarantee diyan sa NLEx at sa Maynilad Water Services.
TRANSLATION: Erap refused to give Sovereign Guarantee to NLEx and Maynila Water Services.
While he was still in power, lots of companies pestered Erap for sovereign guarantees.


For example, while being cross-examined in his plunder trial, Erap told the Sandiganbayan:
I rejected that P40 million offered by Mark Jimenez because I did not want that sovereign guarantee provision in the contract. I knew that if Impsa fails to pay its debts, the government would assume its payment and that would badly affect the people.""
Erap was referring to the $470-million hydroelectric power contract between the Philippine government and Argentinian firm Industrias Metalurgica Pescarmona Sociedad Anonima (Impsa), where the prosecution alleged that businessman Mark Jimenez bribed the former president.

In a 2007 press statement about the plethora of sovereign guarantees issued by President Fidel Ramos to various power companies, Eraps son Senator Jinggoy Estrada said:
Hindi nya tinanggap yon dahil may sovereign guarantee. Ibig sabihin ginagaratiyahan ng ating bansa ung kontrata, ayaw ni Pangulong Estrada.
TRANSLATION: He didnt accept that because theres a sovereign guarantee (requirement). That means the State is guaranteeing the contract, which President Estrada didnt want.
Erap is no saint, but I cannot find a single record showing that Erap granted sovereign guarantees to anybody.

Moreover, the Estrada bio for the 2015 Most Outstanding Mayor Award (MOMA) states:
Determined to bring his pro-poor platform to every facet of the governments operations, he immediately ordered the removal of all sovereign guarantees on contracts for public projects xxx Reconds will show that until January 20, 2001, he did not sign a single government contract with a sovereign guarantee.
Sans claims to the contrary, I think its safe to say that Erap really didnt issue any sovereign guarantee. Im not commenting on the wisdom of his governance (or the lack of it), but the hard fact is that he didnt issue any sovereign guarantee.

ERAP VS THE LOPEZES ETC
Eraps unaccommodating stance must have had a catastrophic effect on the Lopez Group, whose subsidiaries were slowly dying one by one.

But a friendlier replacement may not come in time: Erap was still in the first half of his Presidency.

The Constitution states that only the President has the power to issue sovereign guarantees, so if I were someone who badly needs a major financial lifeline that only a President can give, then Id convince the President to give me one.

But he wont, so the next best thing is to wait for him to step down then ask the next president, but this one just got elected this year. Will my companies survive for the next six years?

Its not just Sonzas sovereign guarantee issue.

Erap in a 2006 speech said just three months into his presidential term, the Ayalas and Lopezes asked him to raise water rates by 80 percent.

Erap said:
I gained their ire when I turned down their request xxx my slogan is Erap para sa Mahirap xxx If I approve their request the poor Filipinos might rephrase my slogan into Erap Pampahirap.""
A loan is a loan, but a water rate hike is basically free money from the People.

Erap added:
Business is a gamble. If you lose in business, you cannot pass your losses to the people. If they win in their business, will they share it to the people?""
Well, if I were in the Lopezes shoes at a time like that, I may have wished for his deposal. And obviously, Id use ABS-CBN, which had a virtual monopoly on public opinion, to realize that goal.


Erap was deposed a little over two years later in January 2001.

I guess even the 1999 wedding of scion Beaver Lopez and Erap daughter Jackie Ejercito did nothing to change Erap's mind.

It's still a problem up to this day.

Yes, Erap made a lot of mistakes. But in as far as the possible motives for removing a president, I think money is most likely on the top of the list.

Sonzas claim that Lopezes use media assets to attack competing interests is not really new, as a 2000 peer-reviewed paper published by Cambridge University Press shows that the Lopezes have a long history of using media assets to attack their political opponents.

In Kinship Politics in Post-War Philippines: The Lopez Family, 1945-1989 , Mina Roces of the University of New South Wales narrated the Lopez Familys ascent from a regional economic power in Ilo-ilo to the wealthiest clan in the country.


The story is quite long, so Ill just focus on the parts that are immediately relevant to this discussion. Note that unless otherwise stated, all contents of the following sections are based on Roces paper.

THE MEDIA-POWERED RISE OF THE LOPEZES 
The massive Lopez fortune started with two Lopez brothers: Fernando, who was involved in Politics, and Eugenio Sr., who focused on business.

Fernando Lopez
Fernandos meteoric rise in Politics started in 1945 when President Sergio Osmena appointed mayor of Iloilo, and President Manuel Roxas reappointed him a year later. He eventually became the vice-president, then the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources for three terms.


Roces wrote:
Thus began a symbiotic relationship between politics and business that thrived on the closeness of the two brothers. With one brother in politics, the Lopez family had the passkey to the realm of special privileges that gave them access to the credit and franchises sealed of to families deprived of political power. While one brother made political connections, the other was the shrewd and ruthless businessman who utilized these special privileges for the family business corporations.
The Lopezes bought the leading broadsheet The Manila Chronicle in September 1947, a critical juncture of Fernandos budding political career.


Roces noted that The Manila Chronicle never turned a profit, so she wondered why a business-savvy Eugenio Sr. kept it running for 24 years.

The Lopezes used the newspaper to all political and business enemies, including the President of the Philippines. Using the newspapers power to shape public opinion, the Lopezes forced political and business enemies to yield to the Lopez Familys demands.

Referring to The Manila Chronicle, Roces even said:
The paper was notorious for biased reporting.
Sounds familiar? Mhm, I know.

Fernando Lopez became a senator just two years into his mayoralty and just three months after acquiring The Manila Chronicle, which praised him all the time.


At a time when taxes from the sugar industry made up 43% of government revenue, the very powerful Lopez-led sugar barons in 1949 convinced presidentiable Elpidio Quirino to pick Fernando as his running mate.

Quirino didnt regret his decision, as The Manila Chronicle ran full-page ads for the Quirino-Lopez ticket while not placing any for rivals Laurel-Briones and Avelino-Francisco.


Backed by a major mass media company and the money of the all-powerful sugar bloc, Fernando became vice-president in 1949.

Fernando was Vice-president and Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources from 1949 to 1953 and from 1965 to 1971, and a senator in between.

While Fernando headed Agriculture and Natural Resources, Eugenio bought the following:
1: Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company (BISCOM), the largest sugar company in Southeast Asia that helped Sugar Bloc members expand their businesses 
2: Pampanga Sugar Mill (PASUMIL), which became the Lopezes second sugar central 
3: Philippine Portland Cement 
4: Industrial Company, which made the jute packaging for sugar 
5: ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation 
6: Manila Electric Company (MERALCO)
ABS-CBN is neither Agriculture nor Natural Resources, but I think its safe to say that the Lopezes learned from their ownership and control of The Manila Chronicle that mass media could do wonders.

BISCOM, PASUMIL, and Industrial Company fall under agriculture, while Philippine Portland Cement and MERALCO fall under Natural Resources.

And Fernando, at the time of their acquisition, was the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

What a coincidence!

MACAPAGAL VS THE LOPEZ SUGAR BLOC
In the 1960s, President Diosdado Macapagal attacked the Lopez and what he called the Lopez Sugar Bloc when he argued that the Lopez and friends used their political connections to get loans from the government-owned DBP, Philippine National Bank (PNB), and Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).

Diosdado Macapagal with daughter Gloria
Included in the loans Macapagal listed are (M denotes million, K denotes thousand):
BISCOM  Php 32.49 M from DBP, Php 3.5 M from PNB 
PASUMIL  Php 4.788 M from DBP, Php 1.2 M from PNB 
Philippine Portland Cement  Php 2.355 M from DBP 
Industrial Company  P1.45 M from DBP 
ABS-CBN  Php 2.875 M from DBP, Php 485 K from PNB, Php 500K from GSIS 
Manila Chronicle  Php 2 M from PNB 
MERALCO  Php 35 M from PNB
Adding DBP and PNB loans of other Lopez companies, thats Php 88.373 million as of 1962.

Just how much is Php 88.373 million?
A peso in 1962 is equal to USD 0.27 so that Php 88.373 million equals USD 23.96 million. Using an inflation calculator, USD 23.96 million in 1962 is equal to USD 204.67 million in 2020. With the 2020 USD:PHP exchange rate hovering at around 1:50, then thats roughly Php 10.2335 billion pesos today.
That is, Php 88.373 million in 1962 can buy as many things as Php 10.233 billion in 2020.

Needless to say, the Lopezes again used their TV, Radio, and Print assets to prevent Macapagals reelection in 1965, or the year Ferdinand Marcos ran for president with Fernando Lopez as running mate.

And they did, as Roces wrote:
The Marcos-Lopez campaign was launched on January 6, 1965. During the entire year of 1965 The Manila Chronicle had almost daily reports on the activities and the speeches of both candidates, while the Macapagal Administration was continuously and ruthless attacked.
Macapagal and Pelaez stepped out, Marcos and Lopez stepped in.

Several years later, Marcos also tried to do what Macapagal did, i.e., wage war against the Lopezes. But this article is already running long, so lets talk about that on another day.

Regardless, whats clear is that based on this discussion, the Lopezes historically exploited their media assets to further their personal interests.

Amidst ABS-CBNs franchise renewal issue, I encourage everyone to keep it real: Let us stop deluding ourselves into thinking that ABS-CBN did nothing but be In the Service of the Filipino.

Just like you, I sometimes get shocked about what other people say, especially when their words go against what I have believed for the longest time.

But then, our political consciousness is shaped mostly by what we see on TV. But then, who ultimately decides on most of what we get to see on TV?

Rufino-Prieto firms cannibalizing the financially ailing Philippine Daily Inquirer?,"Documents show Philippine Daily Inquirers majority owners, the Rufino-Prieto Clan, are using their other family-owned companies to cannibalize what little is left of the newspaper companys assets, at the expense of minority stockholders who may be left with nothing if and when the media firm declares bankruptcy.

PDI sells land to Lexmedia
On 29 August 2018, Inquirer directors approved the sale of Inquirer-owned land near the Makati Central Business District. The board, at the time, is mostly made up of members of the Rufino-Prieto Clan, including:
Alexandra Sandy Prieto-Romualdez (President)
Carlos Rufino
Macario Rufino (Treasurer)
Paolo Prieto
Marixi Prieto
The sale involves six parcels of land totaling 1,990 sqm, where the Philippine Daily Inquirers head offices stand on . The Deeds of Absolute Sale  of the PDI-owned  lots show they were sold to a certain Lexmedia Reality Inc. for a total of Php 156,000,000, broken down as follows:
TCT No. 182449  324 sqm  Php 21,700,000
TCT No. 182450  331 sqm  Php 29,600,000
TCT No. 182451  340 sqm  Php 30,400,000
TCT No. 182452  340 sqm  Php 30,400,000
TCT No. 182453  331 sqm  Php 22,200,000
TCT No. 182454  324 sqm  Php 21,700,000
That is, the Rufino-Prietos sold the lots for no more than Php 78,392 per sqm.


A suspiciously low price
The sale price raises suspicion because the Zonal Value of the six Barangay Tejeros lots along Chino Roces Avenue is Php 120,000 per sqm based on Department of Finance Department Order 24-2017 .

To illustrate the point even further, listings for lots within the same general area are for much higher prices, one listing for a 641-sqm lot  is for Php 300,000 per sqm, while another listing for a 511-sqm lot  is for Php 245,000 per sqm.

Why were the Rufino-Prietos sell PDI-owned land, caring little about the losses they incurred for selling it at so much lower than market rates, to the detriment of PDI shareholders?

The Rufino-Prietos, for example, could have listed the land for 25% more or around Php 100,000 per sqm, and somebody wouldve readily bought it.

Oh! I almost forgot to mention that the sale includes all improvements in the six lots, including the Inquirer Building itself.

Lexmedia bought PDI land at lower than market value, implying that the Rufino-Prietos gave away the Inquirer building and all other improvements to Lexmedia FOR FREE.

Why did the Rufino-Prietos do what they did?
I honestly do not care if the Rufino-Prietos throw money on the streets. Still, we must remember that we are talking about the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which has minority shareholders comprised of lowly journalists who dreamt of a better economic future for themselves.

The decision to sell PDI land at scandalously low prices affects not just the Rufino-Prieto Family but also the minority shareholders who are not part of the PDI board that approved the sale.


PDIs owners as of 2018  show at least thirteen minority shareholders, including the veteran journalist Vic Agustin, who in October 2019 sued the Rufino-Prietos for Syndicated Estafa precisely for these allegedly onerous transactions .
Syndicated estafa is swindling committed by a syndicate of five or more persons. In Agustins lawsuit, that syndicate is the Rufino-Prietos.
The preceding section showed that the Rufino-Prietos, sitting as PDI directors, sold PDI land below-market prices, resulting in financial injury to PDI as a corporation because they couldve quickly sold the same land at a much higher price.

But then, an injury to PDI must also be an injury to the Rufino-Prietos, being that the latter are majority shareholders of PDI. That sounds contradictory, right?


Well, not if you check on who the Rufino-Prietos sold the PDI land to.

Who owns Lexmedia?
The Rufino-Prietos, acting as the agents of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, sold the six lots to Lexmedia, so that the next logical question would be who owns that company?

This is a tricky question because it appears that, based on documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lexmedias ownership structure is buried in layers upon layers of corporations.


To illustrate, Lexmedias ownership structure  is as follows:
Pentap  40.56%
Mediacom  10.19%
Inquirer Holdings  10.15%
Corinthian  2.57%
Alexandra Prieto  3.83%
Carlos Rufino  0.83%
Paolo Prieto  2.42%
Others
(Note that from hereon, all mentions of any of the five Rufino-Prieto PDI directors will be highlighted in red.)

There are three Rufino-Prietos in the list (Alexandra, Carlos, and Paolo) but a majority of the shares belong to corporations (Pentap, Mediacom, Inq Holdings, and Corinthian), so lets check the ownership structures of each of these four owner-firms.


Pentaps owners:
Granprie  20%
Paolo Prieto  20%
Alexandra Prieto  20%
Others
Mediacoms owners :
LRP  68.92%
Others
Inquirer Holdings owners :
Pinnacle  68.89%
Others
Corinthians owners :
Marilex  31.85%
Ionian  11.19%
Macario Rufino  5.49%
Carlos Rufino  5.8%
Alexandra Prieto  1.82%
Marixi Prieto  1.86%
Paolo Prieto  1.82%
Others
At this point, you can see the names of the same Rufino-Prieto PDI directors are popping up. But we are not done yet, as we check the owners of the other corporations mentioned, namely Marilex, Ionian, LRP, Pinnacle, and GranPrie.

Marilexs owners :
Granprie  11.43%
Marixi Prieto  4.28%
Alexandra Prieto  8.57%
Paolo Prieto  8.58%
Others
Ionians owners :

Using data from the General Information sheets of each of the corporations mentioned above, I took the liberty of creating a diagram that illustrates the ownership structure of Lexmedia. The chart takes into consideration the intricate web of corporate layers that ultimately end in one or more of the same five Rufino-Prieto PDI directors.

A diagram showing Lexmedia's corporate ownership. Each large rectangle is a predominantly Rufino-Prieto family firm. Each red rounded box is a Rufino-Prieto family member who also sits in the Philippine Daily Inquirer's board of directors.

Note that based on the same General Information Sheets, one or more of the six PDI directors are also on the board of each of the corporations mentioned above.

These data show that after peeling off a sufficient number of corporate layers, Lexmedia appears to be primarily owned and controlled by the same five Rufino-Prieto directors of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

In short, the Rufino-Prietos basically sold Inquirer-owned land to themselves.

Whats the problem with this?
PDIs Rufino-Prieto directors sold PDI-owned land to Lexmedia at a mind-bogglingly low price. The sale hurt the interests of PDI shareholders, and these are the Rufino-Prieto directors plus PDIs minority shareholders. Hence, why would the Rufino-Prietos hurt not only PDIs minority shareholders but also themselves?

As it turns out, the only ones hurt by the deal are PDIs minority shareholders, as Lexmedia, who bought the property at an extremely low price, is also owned and controlled by the same Rufino-Prieto PDI directors who approved the sale.

We know that the Inquirer has been hemorrhaging in as early as 2017, when declared Php 320 million in losses after tax . I personally doubt that the Inquirer can get out of the red and survive, especially since the Digital Age has brought the demise of newspapers all over the world. For example, more than 20% of all newspapers in the United States have closed down since 2014 .

Hence, I would understand why the Rufino-Prietos would try to hedge risk by evacuating assets from an ailing company. However, what I do not understand is how they can do it without taking into consideration the interests of other company owners who do not belong to their clan.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer was born in the late 80s as an earnest attempt to create a media company that is owned and controlled not by the moneyed elite, but by journalists themselves.

Initially intended to take the form of a journalist cooperative but registered as a corporation for expediency, the Inquirer started with the hope that all those working for it could share the responsibility and hopefully, the rewards .

Inquirer even had a very peculiar by-law in its original Articles of Incorporation: that only Inquirer permanent employees can own Inquirer stocks .

But this by-law didnt last long as the Rufino-Prietos took over in 1990s and established a virtual monopoly on Inquirers corporate decision-making.

Despite my strong reservations on the quality of Inquirers current fleet of journalists, I cannot deny the fact that the Inquirer was borne with the noble hope of giving journalists better lives without asking them to sell their bodies and souls to the devil.

Its bad enough that Inquirer failed to fulfill that promise, but what makes matters so much worse is that the same people who helped create their company  the minority shareholders  stand to lose whatever little they can get in the end.

As Lexmedia and the Rufino-Prieto companies, in apparent anticipation of Inquirers bankruptcy declaration, cannibalize whats left of the Philippine Daily Inquirers assets, what will happen to the minority shareholders, some of whom are even journalists themselves, who werent lucky enough to have Rufino or Prieto as a last name? 


And how about the Philippine Daily Inquirer's creditors, if any?",RJ Nieto,01/26/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/01/rufino-prieto-firms-cannibalizing.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
UP Naming Binarat? UP gets only 22/sqm monthly from UP-Ayala Technohub,"The University of the Philippines Systems 2018 Commission on Audit Report  states that UP has two Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects with Ayala Land: the UP-Ayala Technohub along Commonwealth and the UP Town Center along Katipunan.

The two projects are business deals, so common sense dictates that the revenue sharing structure should be commensurate to how much each business partner invested in the venture.

Documents, however, show that it isnt the case, as Ayala keeps the lions share of profits.
[Full Disclosure: I was a Math Major in the University of the Philippines - Diliman.]



The UP Ayala Technohub

The UP Ayala Technohub partnership basically works like this: UP contributes land, Ayala provides improvements, Ayala leases out property to various tenants, then lease revenues are split between UP and Ayala. 

Hence, the next logical question would be how much each one gets.

The UP Ayala Technohub has four components: office space, residential space, hotels, and retail space. Based on the same COA Annual Audit Report, the revenue sharing structure for each of these components, expressed as a ratio of UPs share to Ayalas, is as follows:
 Office Space  10:90 for buildings, 15:85 for land 
 Residential  5:95 
 Hotel  5:95 
 Retail  10:90 for buildings, 15:85 for land
Given this, why does UP get only 5- 15% of revenues while Ayala gets the lions share? 

A screenshot of COA's 2018 Annual Audit of the UP System, showing the revenue sharing structure for the UP Ayala Technohub Project.

The same COA report states that UP has collected a total of Php 1.094 billion  from the Technohub Project during the 11 years from 2008 to 2018.
The exact figure, Php 1,093,867,441.43, when divided by 11 years, translates to Php 99,442,494.66 annually or Php 8,286,874.55 monthly.
That sounds like a lot of money for UP, but given that the UP leased Ayala 380,630 sqm  of UP land, Ayalas payments to UP amount to a monthly rent of just Php 21.77 per sqm.

A screenshot of COA's 2018 Annual Audit of the UP System, showing Ayala's payments to the UP System in relation to the Technohub Project.

In fairness to Ayala, it developed only 20 hectares during its first phase, and generously assuming that it didnt expand at all since then, UPs total collections is basically a monthly rental payment of Php 41.43 per sqm.

We're talking about prime real estate here: Only an idiot would lease out a prime lot in Quezon City for less than Php 50 per sqm.



What is Fair?
Recall that UPs lease revenue share ranges from 5-15% depending on the type of real estate. For ease of computation, lets give Ayala a headstart by assuming that UP gets the maximum 15% on everything, which makes the revenue sharing structure a uniform 15:85.

Recall that UP contributed 380,630 sqm to the venture. Modestly assuming that land along Commonwealth Avenue costs Php 20,000 per square meter in 2006 when the deal was signed, UPs equity in the partnership would amount to Php 7.61 billion.

Ayala, meanwhile, earmarked for the UP Ayala Technohub Php 6 billion over the next 5-10 years .

Even if we assume that Ayala shelled out the entire Php 6 billion on the first year, that would still mean, based on the above figures, that the total equity in the entire venture is Php 13.61 billion, with UP providing 56% and Ayala 44%.

If the capital sharing is 56:44, then why is the revenue sharing only 15:85 at best?

If you contributed over half of the capital in a business venture, would you be fine with receiving less than a fifth of revenues?


A Disturbing Business Arrangement?

The UP-Ayala revenue sharing structure is especially disturbing on the following grounds:
First, UPs Real Estate Tax Exemption
UP is exempt from paying real estate taxes  based on the Supreme Court decision on UP v City Treasurer. In that case, the City Treasurer of Quezon City said UP was delinquent on Php 107 million in real estate taxes for the years 2009 to 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, or a period of 63 months.

This translates to Php 1.7 million worth of monthly real estate tax payments that Ayala could have paid the government if UP wasnt tax-exempt. That is, Ayala saved Php 4.46 per sqm in tax payments because it partnered with UP.

Despite this, Ayala gives UP just Php 21.77 per sqm on the average, while Ayalas revenue share ranges from roughly Php 123 to Php 414 per sqm , or anywhere from 566 to 1,900% more.

Second, Ayala charges tenants a lot
Some property listings for Ayala Technohub office spaces show Ayala charges tenants a lot of money.

For example, a Php 450,000 is the monthly rent for a 600 sqm office space listing , or Php 750 per sqm per month. And theres even another 2,300 sqm office space for Php 1,495,000 a month , or Php 650 per sqm.

UP Ayala Technohub has a gross leasable area  of 156,708.75 sqm. Generously assuming a constant office space vacancy rate of 16% in Quezon City, and modestly assuming a monthly rent of Php 650 per sqm, then the UP Ayala Technohub must be collecting around Php 85.6 million in monthly rentals for office space alone, 10 percent of which (UPs share) is Php 8.56 million.

This doesnt look very different from the Php 8.29 million UP gets monthly per the COA report, but the gross leasable area Ayala provided is based only on Buildings A to O . This doesnt include revenues from  the four-storey Building P with 2,660 sqm per floor  and  the 120-guestroom, six-storey Microtel .

Given this, is Ayala Land accurately reporting revenues or is it under-declaring revenues in order to pay UP less?

Remember that COA audits UP but COA doesn't audit Ayala.

Third, something fishy about the UP Board
Its bad enough that UP apparently receives a pittance from the Ayala deal but to make it worse, Ayalas payments even come late or not all. 

For example, COA in 2014 chided UP Diliman chancellor Michael Tan for the universitys laxity and leniency in enforcing the UP-Ayala Technohub Contract after Ayala had P76 million in unpaid rent and P3.06 million in penalties .

To make matters even worse, the UP Board is not even giving UP Diliman its rightful share of what little revenue UP receives from Technohub.

The UP Board of Regents in 2012 approved a 60-40 Income Sharing Scheme between the UP System and UP Diliman, but COA said the Board has so far failed to issue proper guidelines to turn this scheme into reality .

The UP System has so far failed to remit to UP Diliman over Php 287 million in revenues from the Technohub deal and COA said it had no definite schedule or plan as to when they should remit the share of UP Diliman .

Had the UP System given UP Diliman its rightful share, then UP Diliman wouldve been able to fund important projects like desperately needed building renovations and maintenance outlays.


The Bottom-line
Much like the notaries Ayala-owned Manila Waters concession deal, it seems the government also got the shorter end of the stick in as far as the UP Ayala Technohub project.

The UP Ayala Technohub as an Ayala charity project: it is, instead, a full-fledged for-profit business venture.

While I agree that UP Dilimans vast landowning on the far side of Commonwealth Avenue is largely grassland prior to the Ayala Project, its grassland in the middle of Quezon City where land is extremely scarce and infrastructure is far more available than most areas in the country.

Moreover, the single biggest challenge facing businesses, especially those that heavily rely on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), is finding quality talent for its workforce.

But thats not really problem for those in Technohub because job applicants are literally situated JUST ACROSS THE ROAD, i.e. UP Diliman, one of the countrys top universities.

With that said, why did UP enter a deal that just pays them peanuts?

And we haven't even mentioned the UP Town Center yet.",RJ Nieto,01/18/2020,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/01/up-naming-binarat-up-gets-only-22sqm.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
ABS-CBNs Franchise Renewal: Will Lopezes make ultimate sacrifice to save thousands of jobs?,"Most of us are already familiar and have a working understanding of the ABS-CBN franchise renewal issue, but to give you a refresher, heres the basic issue.

Every free-to-air TV or radio station is required to secure a congressional franchise in the form of a Republic Act, a franchise that usually lasts for 25 years. A new franchise (READ: A New Republic Act) is needed to operate after those 25 years.

ABS-CBN received its franchise on 30 March 1995 via RA No. 7966, so it needs to get a new one before RA No. 7966 expires 25 years later on 30 March 2020.

And thats the problem.


Why need a franchise?
The Constitution guarantees Press Freedom, but it doesnt guarantee access to broadcast frequencies. While anyone has the right to engage in journalism, not everyone has the right to have sole use of any broadcast frequency, as Physics sets limitations on the latter.

In the case of TV, there are at most 12 available VHF channels (Channels 2, 3, to 13) and at most 38 in the UHF band (Channels 14 to 51).
Reporters without Borders recognized this reality when it wrote (emphasis supplied):
Licensing became necessary as broadcast frequencies constitute a scarce resource In Metro Manila for example, the frequency is limited to 23 physical spots for TV channels, 32 spots for AM radio channels, and 25 FM spots  and they are all taken at the moment.
The TV firm ABS-CBN, by virtue of Press Freedom, has the right to create and distribute content, but broadcasting through the Channel 2 Frequency is a privilege. ABS-CBNs dominion over Channel 2 means some other TV operator failed to get it, and this privilege was granted to ABS-CBN only by an Act of Congress.


Imagine this:
If ABS-CBN as a Filipino entity has the inalienable right to broadcast via a frequency, then the equal protection clause of the constitution means every other Filipino should enjoy the same right. Applying this to Metro Manila, how can 23 physical TV spots be distributed among Metro Manilas over 10 million residents?
Thats clearly impossible, hence the need for the government to decide who among aspiring broadcasters are in the best position to serve Public Interest, i.e., who among them is most deserving of receiving a franchise, i.e., a privilege.


Suffice it to say, the ABS-CBN Franchise Renewal Issue arises not from Free Speech or Press Freedom as defined in the Constitution, but from Public Services as defined in the Public Services Law.

Will ABS-CBNs Franchise be renewed?
Two bills were filed in September 2014: one by Baguio Rep. Nicasio Aliping, and another by Isabela Rep. Giorgidi Aggabao. Inquirer reported that both failed to pass because then-President Aquinos House allies felt [ABS-CBNs] criticisms against the President were too personal and offensive and went to the point of nitpicking.

After failing to renew their franchise under the 16th Congress (2013-2016), ABS-CBN hoped to get it in the 17th Congress (2016-2019). Nueva Ecija Rep. Micaela Violago attempted this through her House Bill No. 4349 filed in November 2016, but it failed to pass.

Were at the 18th Congress (2019-2022) and its make-or-break for the Lopez-owned ABS-CBN, as its franchise expires in just a few months.

Unfortunately, an immensely popular president is against it.

In as late as 30 December 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte told the Lopezes:
Itong ABS, mag-expire ang contract ninyo. Mag-renew kayo, ewan ko lang kung may mangyari diyan. Kung ako sa inyo ipagbili niyo na yan. (ABS-CBNs contract is about to expire. I dont know if youll get renewed. Id sell it off if I were you.)
Duterte has vocally opposed ABS-CBNs renewal citing, among others, its failure to run his paid political advertisements during the 2016 presidential race, even threatening to file estafa (swindling) charges against the company.


Oh, and do you remember what ABS-CBN aired on the night before election day?

This, and it was paid for by opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes:



A glimmer of hope?
Senator Ralph Rectos August 2019 SB No. 981 , Nueva Ecija Rep. Micaela Violagos refiled HB No. 676 and Laguna Rep. (and former ABS-CBN employee) Sol Aragones HB No. 3947 all aim to renew ABS-CBNs expiring franchise. 

The three bills, however, are still pending as of 04 January 2020, or less than three months from the current franchise expiry on 30 March 2020.

Despite Dutertes opposition, some of his allies, including Deputy Speakers Vilma Santos, Rose Marie Arenas, Aurelio Gonzales, and Johnny Pimentel, strongly backed ABS-CBNs franchise renewal. Meanwhile, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano departed from his historically Duterte Diehard Supporter (DDS) stance and instead said he would be fair on this issue.

Assuming that one of the house bills (or maybe a consolidated version) somehow passes on the third reading, ABS-CBN still wont be out the woods because the counterpart Senate Bill (Rectos SB No. 981) will still have to pass by a simple majority (13 votes).

What makes this problematic is the fact that the Senate is chock full of administration allies and senators who may hold grudges against the company.

ABS-CBNs problem with 23 Senators
Lets list down some senators who may find it difficult to OK the proposal.

[Sen. #1 to #6] Six senators are from the Presidents PDP-Laban (Manny Pacquiao, Juan Miguel Zubiri, Bato dela Rosa, Bong Go, Koko Pimentel, and Francis Tolentino) and people generally expect them to vote along party lines.

[Sen. #7] Sen. Nancy Binay (UNA) may view ABS-CBN as among the media companies that helped destroy her father Jejomar Binays political prospects.

[Sen. #8] Sen. Bong Revilla (Lakas) may view ABS-CBN as among those who helped put him under detention.

[Sen. #9 to #12] Senators Dick Gordon (VNP), Ping Lacson (Ind), Joel Villanueva (CIBAC), and Win Gatchalian (NPC) are generally mum on the issue, but theyre up for re-election for a second term in 2022, so will they risk incurring the wrath of the heavily pro-Duterte electorate?

[Sen. #13] Sen. Imee Marcos may be unlikely to vote in favor of it, and the political reason is pretty obvious.

Note that Senator Leila de Lima is in detention for drug charges so she cant vote on the bill, so only 23 senators will decide on it.

That is, at least 13 out of the 23 senators face significant political disincentives to vote for renewal. Assuming that ABS-CBN gets the vote of the remaining ten senators, it will have to convince three among the fourteen listed above.

What are the chances that SB No. 981 will pass? Well...

Duterte the Gatekeeper
Now, lets assume that the bill hurdles Congress and arrives at Malacaang.

Earlier last year, Presidential Communications Sec. Martin Andanar opined that the President is unlikely to veto the bill, but he based this solely on his observation that the president never categorically said Hindi ko ie-extend ang franchise (I will not extend the franchise).

But just because Duterte didnt say so doesnt mean he wont, and the presidents statements in the past couple of weeks suggest that he may exercise veto power.

If that happens, Congress will have to override the veto by a two-thirds vote with each House voting separately. That is, two-thirds (around 200 solons) of the House and another two-thirds (16 senators) of the Senate is needed to override the Presidents veto.

That will be tough because six PDP-Laban senators are averse to openly humiliating the president, so its just a matter of getting two more senators to vote against a veto override (Marcos, Revilla, and Binay, are strong candidates).

ABS-CBNs franchise renewal saga will be an excruciatingly steep climb for the Lopezes.

Options for the Lopezes
Faced with the imminent threat of closure on 30 March 2020, Duterte openly advised the Lopezes to sell ABS-CBN, but it appears that the Lopezes are averse to that prospect.

There are a few alternative options that I can think of: 
1: Acquire another company that has an existing broadcast franchise
PRO: Assuming theres a willing seller, the problem will merely be a matter of adjusting the broadcast frequency and it will be business as usual.

CON: The VHF frequency (Channels 2 to 13) is already tightly packed, so ABS-CBN will likely broadcast on the UHF spectrum (Channels 14 to 51). Unfortunately, UHF may have poorer signal quality in far-flung areas, i.e., ABS-CBN may reach a smaller chunk of the population, which will likely hurt advertising revenues and aggregate influence on public opinion.

2: Syndicate content to other networks
PRO: ABS-CBN can just sell airing rights to its shows to other networks, or maybe buy block time in, say, Manny Pangilinans TV5.

CON: ABS-CBN wont be able to broadcast political content, which it has historically used to great effect. Thatd be like pulling ABS-CBNs widely-feared political fangs off.

3: Forget free-to-air TV and go fully online
PRO: Online means no franchise needed, and ABS-CBN already has the streaming platform iWant.

CON: Philippine Internet is slow and currently has lower coverage than TV. Meanwhile, iWants user interface is still very crude and superior competitors like Netflix, HBO Go, and Amazon Prime make iWant look like a high school project.

Arguably, all of these options will diminish ABS-CBNs influence, and thats a problem for the Lopezes.

Will people lose jobs?
Understandably, many ABS-CBN employees feel threatened as they face the prospect of losing their jobs if and when ABS-CBN shuts down, and some of its employees like singer Yeng Constantino have openly encouraged the President to reconsider his stance.

If Duterte agrees then good. If Duterte refuses then everythings up to Gabby Lopez.

Regardless of the Presidents justification for his aversion to franchise renewal, the reality is that Gabby Lopez is faced with two basic options that the President himself laid out:  hold on to ABS-CBN as it faces potential closure and hope for a last-minute miracle, or  sell it to somebody else.

Will Gabby Lopez consider Dutertes stance as fait accompli and sell his prized possession if only to save thousands of jobs, or will he bring thousands of his employees along with him as his company goes down?

#2019SEAGames: Fact-checking Marlon Ramos' Inquirer expos vs BCDA,"Inquirer reporter Marlon Ramos, on the 02 December 2019 article Deal to construct P13-B govt complex, sports hub at New Clark City questioned, said that based on documents, Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and Malaysian MTD Capital Berhad (MTD) entered into an anomalous deal.

The deal in question is the New Government Administrative Center (NGAC) and Sports Complex project in New Clark City in Tarlac, i.e., the same sports complex used today for the 2019 SEA Games.

Lets analyze.


BCDA-MTD Agreement OKd despite OGCC objections
Ramos wrote, ""BCDA signed a joint-venture agreement with MTD despite getting an adverse legal opinion issued by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) in early 2018, records showed.

Ramos then quoted former OGCC head Rudolf Philip Jurado, who issued a 30 January 2018 legal opinion stating that the NGACs Sports Complex segment as a rule should both be subject to public bidding. 

former OGCC head Rudolf Jurado
Note that the entire writeup doesnt contain any direct quote from the supposed records and documents, and the same documents werent embedded in the article either, so I cannot check if Ramos understood the document correctly, or if he based his article on flawed understanding.

I have written exposs since 2015, some of which were used as resource material for congressional hearings and police/NBI investigations. As a rule, I provide the source document, especially if its publicly available in the first place. That way, readers can verify for themselves the accuracy of my observations.

Ramos didnt do this, even if the credibility of his entire article depends on whats in this document.

I suspected that Ramos wasnt telling the whole story, especially because Jurado used the term as a rule, meaning that government projects usually go through to public bidding, but not all the time.

In short, exceptions exist. Hence, Ramos should have checked first if the Sports Complex falls under any of the legal exceptions or not, but he didnt.
Ramos reinforced my suspicion when he wrote, But [Jurado] said the construction of the NGAC had complied with government rules on joint-venture projects, with Jurado saying that the sports complex should be a part of the Joint Venture.

Hence, Ramos contradicted his entire hypothesis when the article states that no other than his primary source Jurado said the project is legally compliant.


If Ramos wanted to poke holes on the project and based on Jurados statement, Ramos shouldve checked if BCDA made the sports complex part of the BCDA-MTD joint venture.

Ramos even quoted Jurado as saying, It should be noted that the joint venture should cover the entire project and not only NGAC.

Did BCDA include the Sports Complex in the joint venture?

Thats what Ramos should have explored, but he didnt.

Ugh. Marlon.

Differing OGCC opinions
Ramos either misunderstood or worse, totally failed to understand the OGCC opinions.

As explained earlier, Jurados January 2018 opinion states that the sports complex project is compliant, with the caveat that it must be made part of the BCDA-MTD Joint Venture. Thus, the question is whether BCDA made it part of the Joint Venture or not.

BCDA President and CEO Vivencio ""Vince"" Dizon
In a 03 December 2019 press conference, Dizon said BCDA believed that we already addressed the concerns of the OGCC in the final joint venture agreement that was signed in February 2018.In response to this, BCDA made the business decision, which [it] is empowered to do under its charter [to] give due course to this (project).

In short, BCDA attempted to comply with the January 2018 OGCC opinion, and it believes it did. As to whether it complied, however, is another matter, so hold on to that thought for now.

After the clarifications were made, GOCC said, BCDA, tama ginawa niyo (you did right), Dizon said.

In the same presser, Government Corporate Counsel Justice Elpidio Vega seconded Dizons statement, when he said OGCC issued an October 2018 opinion affirming that BCDA complied with the conditions set in the earlier January 2018 opinion.

current OGCC head Elpidio Vega
Vega said, The contract review which was issued way back in January  was indeed not a negative opinion, but in fact, it approved and gave the go signal to BCDA. The only problem then was more on the modality on the procurement, and that was, however, explained expertly well by BCDA in going into the joint venture. We studied it, and we found that the same is a joint venture and has passed the rules and regulations regarding it. Thats why in October , we gave the affirmative opinion. I hereby confirm that the same is above-board, and we found no legal impediment to its execution.

The first opinion gave the go signal to BCDA, and in that instance, the BCDA is on the right track, Vega added.

That is, the January 2018 opinion, on which Ramos entire article was anchored, actually allowed BCDA to proceed, but on the condition that the sports facilities be made part of the BCDA-MTD Joint Venture Agreement. BCDA complied with the condition, and months later, OGCC said what BCDA did is correct.

In short, Marlon Ramos completely misunderstood the January 2018 opinion and proceeded to write fake news based on this colossal misunderstanding. 

Time Constraints
Dizon said the government was in a rush to build facilities for the 2019 SEA Games, given that it agreed to host the event only two years before schedule.

Dizon said, We were told that we needed to build facilities that we would need for the Southeast Asian Games. Remember that the proponent submitted a proposal without those sports facilities to be built. 

The New Clark City Athletics Stadium
It was BCDA who said, We need those sports facilities to be part of this because we will be hosting the 2019 Southeast Asian Games and we need those facilities post-haste. This was 2017, then 2018. You know how long it takes to construct a 20,000-seater stadium? Dizon added.

Dizon explained that BCDA had to start moving and building the facilities for the Philippines to avoid international embarrassment.

BCDA-MTDs Criminal Intent
Ramos also quoted an anonymous source that alleges criminal intent and intention to defraud the government, which is a pretty loaded accusation for an article containing zero documentary evidence.

Ramos wrote, The source said MTD used the Filipino peoples money to finance the project that would provide profits from three different sourcesthe original project cost, the reasonable costs and returns, and rental fees.

Ramos quoted the anonymous source as saying that the deal is certainly disadvantageous to the government.

New Clark Aquatic Center
MTD used the Filipino peoples money implies unjustly used public funds to finance the project.

We all know that foreign investors who come to Philippine shores are legally allowed to borrow from local banks. That isnt new.

MTD would have committed an injustice only if it ran away with the money, or if the loan got a sovereign guarantee, i.e., the government told the lender that it'd pay for the loan in case MTD fails to do so.

MTD is still here, and Ramos didnt provide proof that the loan has a sovereign guarantee.

BCDA President and CEO Vivencio Dizon, in the same presser, said the government did not guarantee the loan.

So how, exactly, was the loan unjust? Ramos didnt explain that.

That article is bad journalism, Marlon. That is bad journalism.

To make matters worse, the claim that BCDA and MTD are cheating the government is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Ramos evidence was just an anonymous source. Ramos took a gargantuan leap of logic, possibly out of the need to meet his articles deadline. Yes, Ramos source said the deal is anomalous, but Marlon didnt even bother to ask the anonymous source HOW EXACTLY it is so.

What does a responsible journalist do when his article is still half-baked and the deadline is at hand? 

A responsible journalist DOES NOT submit that half-baked article and submits something else instead. 

But I guess half-baked articles are good enough for the Inquirer.",RJ Nieto,12/03/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/12/2019seagames-fact-check-marlon-ramos-bcda-mtd-berhad.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"I SAW ""SPEAKER NA TAPAT"" CAYETANO'S 2020 HOUSE BUDGET. HMM, MAY TERM SHARING PA BA?","Sabi ni Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano sa profile pic niya noong Marso, siya ay magiging isang ""Speaker na Tapat"".

Well, tingnan nga natin ang proposed 2020 budget niya.

Note: Sinulat ko 'to in conversational Taglish para mas madaling ma-gets ng mas nakararami.


Recall na noong 20 September 2019, sinabi ni House Committee on Accounts chairman and Cavite Rep. Abraham Bambol Tolentino sa GMA News na:
We did not expect that there will be additional Deputy Speaker; we did not expect that there will be additional vice chairpersons on [House Committees] on Appropriations and Ways and Means; we did not expect either that there will be newly created committees We are talking about all the employees, over 4,000, including those who are in a contractual status, permanents and other employees.
Bilang reaksiyon, tinanong ko sa isang social media post kung ano ba yang extra P1.6 billion na House budget.

Sabi ko, aanhin pa ni Speaker Cayetano ng dagdag na pondo kung kinaya naman ng Alvarez-Arroyo House na suportahan ang LAHAT ng mga priority bills ni PRRD with a much lower budget?

As shown in a 03 June 2019 infographic posted in Thinking Pinoy, the House of Representatives under GMA (and predecessor Alvarez) passed ALL of PRRD's 28 priority bills... and they had only a P11-B budget in 2018.

Okey na sana yung 14 deputy speakers tulad noong huling kongreso kahit mahal, kako ipikit-mata ko na lang bilang isang Political Realist. 

Pero bakit dadagdagan pa ang gastusin ng bayan via more 8 additional deputy speakers ngayong House na 'to e pwede naman ilagay na lang ang pondo sa mga priority projects ni PRRD?

Health, education, social services, infra, disaster relief... ang daming pwedeng paglagyan ng pera pero bakit sa walang bagong deputy speaker ibibigay?

Yun ang problema ko.

Cayetano reacts
Nag-react si Speaker Cayetano via personal attacks, na kesyo fake news lang raw yung banat ng a certain blogger at may axe to grind o sama ng loob lang yon sa kanya.

Dahil diumanoy may sama ng loob sa kanya yung blogger na yon e wala na dapat tanong-tanong sa P1.6 billion, GANERN?

Maraming puwedeng mabili ang P1.6 billion: Gamot, classroom, sweldo ng nars at teacher, ang haba-haba ng listahan. Ang dami-daming priority project ni Pangulo ang kulang ng pondo kaya hindi biro ang P1.6 billion.

Pero in fairness, medyo nahimasmasan si Speaker Cayetano sa ibang mga interview.

Doon sa isa, sinabi niyang ang big chunk ng P1.6 billion e pupunta sa various projects, pero di niya sinabi kung magkano ang big chunk at kung ano mismo yung various projects. 



Doon naman sa isa pa, sinabi niyang gagamitin raw ang P1.6 billion para sa research, adding, whats one-billion that will be added to Congress to make sure that the P4.1-trillion is spent very well?

Pero talaga, P1.6 billion para sa research? Ang total budget nga ng PAGASA, for 2019 e P1.6 billion lang, tapos tila may budget cut pa sa 2020 kasi 1.4 billion lang ang proposed. Tapos ang research budget ng House, P1.6 billion? 

P1.4 billion lang ang proposed total budget ng PAGASA for 2020.
So mas mahalaga na magpondo ng additional deputy speakers kaysa taasan ang sweldo ng mga meteorologist natin sa PAGASA na isa-isa nang lumalayas sa bansa dahil sa baba ng suweldo?                                                                                                                   
Tulad nang paliwanag sa huling Thinking Pinoy article, karapatan ng bawat taxpayer na manghingi ng accountability mula sa mga public servant, at kasama na roon ang kasapi ng House of Representatives.

Pero dahil ayaw nilang sumagot ng diretso sa request for an itemization, nagkusa na akong humanap ng paraan para mas malaman ang punot dulo ng issue.

Walang itemization? Walang itemization!
As explained in a previous Thinking Pinoy article, ang hinihingi ko e mas malinaw na itemization ng kung saan gagastusin ang dagdag na P1.6 billion, at so far e maliit lang naman ang description na kayang ibigay ni Speaker Cayetano tungkol sa kung magkano ang pupunta sa mga bagong imbento niyang walong deputy speakerships.

Kung sinagot lang niya ako ng diretso e di ok na, tapos na ang drama, pero hindi e. Simple lang naman na i-scan niya yung itemization at i-post online pero hindi magawa?

So sige, i-try nating hanapin ang itemization na yan. Pero heto muna ang basics.

Ang 2020 National Budget ay informal term para sa 2020 General Appropriations Act, na dahil hindi pa naisasabatas e tinatawag pang General Appropriations Bill (GAB), filed as House Bill 4228.

Ipinasa ng House ang final nilang version ng GAB noon 20 September 2019 at dadalhin ito sa Senado para busisiin naman ng mga senador. Kasama sa GAB ang budget ng lahat ng government agencies pero karaniwang hindi pinakikialaman ng Senado ang proposed budget ng House bilang parliamentary courtesy.

In short, yung final proposed House Budget na nakapaloob sa GAB ang pinakamalamang na maging House Budget for 2020, aside from the fact na iyon mismo ang nais na budget ng House.

Ilang araw nang offline ang website ng House (congress.gov.ph) kaya hindi ko ma-download ang GAB, at coincidentally(?) e parang nag-offline siya simula nang pumutok ang butsi ng Speaker. Nag-up siya kani-kanina lang, pero hindi pa rin ma-download yung text ng HB 4228.

So bilang workaround, humingi ako ng hard copy mula sa mga little birds ko sa HoR. Napakahigpit raw ng pag-release ng kopya pero buti naman at naparaanan nila, at eto yong dokumentong pinakahanap-hanap ko, ang final version ng House Bill 4228, ang General Appropriations Bill for 2020.

Kalkalan na, mga friendships!

The Proposed House Budget for 2020
Makikita ang 2020 House Budget sa Volume I-A pages 9 to 11, na filed under I. Congress of the Philippines; D. House of Representatives.

Medyo simple lang para makita kung nasaan ang P1.6 billion: ikumpara ang mga line item amounts sa 2020 House Budget doon sa same na line item amount noong 2019 na budget.

Narito ang scan ng proposed 2020 House Budget na nakapaloob sa National Budget:

HB 4228 - 2020 General Appr... by ThinkingPinoy on Scribd

Para naman sa previous budgets, click here for the 2019 House Budget at click here for the 2018 House Budget.

Para mas madaling makita, gumawa ako ng side-by-side comparison ng mga line item amounts, at sa dulo e kinompyut ko ang difference. Kinulayan ko na rin ng red kung bumaba ang amount, green naman kung tumaas, at orange kung walang nagbago.

Unahin natin ang overview:


Makikita ritong tataas ng P1.32 billion ang total 2020 House budget kumpara sa 2019.

Malinaw na rito na may paglaki nga ng budget, pero bakit hindi P1.6 billion tulad nang sinabi ni Cong. Tolentino?

Tingnan pa natin ng mas maigi.

Three Basic Categories ng Line Items
May tatlong basic categories ng mga line items sa budget:  Personnel Services,  Capital Outlays at  Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE).

Pag sinabing Personnel Services, we mean yung mga pasweldo sa empleyado, allowances, bonuses, at pati na rin yung mga pambayad sa SSS, Pag-ibig, PhilHealth, etc.
Pag sinabi namang Capital Outlay, we mean yung pambili ng mga fixed assets tulad ng opisina, upuan, pang-construction, at iba pang property ng House.
Pag sinabi namang MOOE, e halo-halo na yon. Lahat ng hindi kasama sa unang dalawang basic categories, shinu-shoot dito sa MOOE.

Tingnan ang susunod na table (note that figures in the succeeding tables are in 000s, so i-multiply niyo by 1000 lahat, e.g. 92,976 means 92,976,000):



As you can see, BUMABA ng P173.2 million ang personnel services o yung total na pondong pang-employee benefits. Note na WALANG capital outlay for 2020, so walang pondong panggawa o pangkumpuni ng bagong opisina o pambili ng bagong equipment.

Pero kung sabi ni Speaker Cayetano sa Rappler, the extra P1.6 billion will fund salary increases for House workers, bakit yung line item ng pasweldo para sa plantilla e bumaba tapos hindi naman nagbago ang total allotment for contractuals?

Parang may mali? I know, so tingnan natin ng mas mabuti.

Inamin mismo ni Speaker Cayetano sa Rappler na may pondo para sa mga bagong posisyon at ayon naman kay Rep. Tolentino e hindi biro ang halaga na gugugulin para pondohan ang mga bagong posisyong ito. Di ba ngat sabi mismo ng the House Accounts Committeee chair in the same GMA News interview:
There are a lot of increase(s) in the expenses for 2020 for equipment, new offices for additional deputy speakers, and a lot of expenses really.
So kung may increase, nasaan? Yan ang tanong ngayon.

What are Savings?
May isang Special Provisions clause doon sa GAB Vol I-A page 13 that partly reads:
Augmentation of any item in the appropriations of the Congress of the Philippines. xxx [T]he Speaker, with respect to the House of Representatives, are hereby authorized to augment any item for their respective offices from any savings in other items


Tataglishin ko:
Pagdaragdag sa kahit anong item sa budget ng Congress. xxx Ang Speaker, with respect sa House, ay maaaring magdagdag sa kahit anong item para sa kanilang ahensiya mula sa mga savings sa ibang items...
Pag may walong bagong deputy speaker, may karagdagang staff rin ang mga yon, di ba? Papayag ba ang isang karaniwang congressman na magsisante ng sariling tauhan para magkaroon ng financial space for the additional staffing needs ng mga bagong deputy speaker?

Kung popondohan ni Speaker ang mga bagong posisyon pero nagbawas pa siya ng pondo for personnel services and capital outlay, so tama bang sabihin na magre-realign ng budget?

There you go.

Saan kukuha ng savings?
Both yung 2019 National Budget (na batas na) at 2020 National Budget (na proposal pa) ay may clause regarding Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations, which reads:
Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations. Unexpended quarterly and year-end balances of approved appropriations for xxx House of Representatives xxx shall remain valid appropriations and shall continue to be available until fully spend and shall remain under their control and accountability...

I-taglish ko:
Ang mga hindi nagastos na quarterly at year-end balance ng mga inaprubahang gastusin para sa House ay mananatiling valid at available hanggang maubos at mananatiling nasa kanilang control at pananagutan
Malaking issue yung sinasabing absorptive capacity ng isang agency dahil karaniwang mababalewala ang budget allocation nito na hindi magagamit within the fiscal year.
Halimbawa, kung may 100 pesos ang DPWH pero 80 pesos lang ang nagastos sa buong taon, balewala na ang natitirang 20 pesos at kailangan na nitong maghintay for the next national budget.
Hindi ganoon sa House.

Yung mga hindi nagastos sa House Budget from the previous year, nake-carry over to the current year. Ibig sabihin, kung may nilaan P1 billion for a certain project na hindi na itinuloy, puwedeng gastusin pa rin ang P1 billion na iyon bilang savings sa susunod na taon o hanggang maubos ito.

Okey lang sana kung lehitimong hindi natuloy ang proyekto pero hindi laging ganon e.

Parang DAP ni PNoy?
Tingnan niyo yung unconstitutional na Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) nina dating Pangulong Noynoy Aquino at dating DBM Sec. Butch Abad.

Ang ginawa nila e tahasang HINDI GINAGASTOS ang budget at dinedeclare na savings para mai-realign nila kung saan nila gusto. Yung Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF), hindi nila ginamit nina PNoy para sa benepisyo ng mga govt employees at sa halip e ni-realign ang MPBF para pambili ng Dengvaxia.

Remember what Senator Richard Gordon said in 2017 about Dengvaxia ?


In short, ang ""DAP technique"" e yung mangangako ka na gagamitin ang pondo para sa isang bagay, pero sa huli e gagastusin mo pala para sa iba.

Parang yung binigyan ka ng nanay mo ng baon para pambili ng lunch sa eskwela, pero di mo ginastos, tinawag mong savings, at pinanlaro mo sa ng DotA sa kompyuteran. Ganern na ganern.

Dineklara ng Supreme court na unconstitutional na ang DAP technique pero mukhang naiwasan ng Kongreso ang pagbabawal na ito dahil sa Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations clause ng National Budget, na parang ginagawang exempted sa SC DAP ruling ang Kongreso.

In short, kung may hindi nagastos (or sadyang hindi ginastos) na 2019 House budget, puwede pang gastusin ito ng House sa 2020, on top of the 2020 House Budget.

Medyo tumaas nga ang kilay ko diyan kasi ilang buwan nang hindi sumusuweldo ang maraming contractuals sa House at nagkasibakan na ng mga maintenance staff, tapos binawasan pa ang pasweldo House budget for 2020?
Kasama kaya ang 2019 pasweldo ng mga ito sa gagawing savings ng House na maaaring irealign?
With that said, may dalawa lang akong nakikitang puwedeng pagkuhanan ng Savings para pondohan ang mga karagdagang deputy speaker:

Allocations from 2019 House Budget na hindi nagamit, hindi ginamit, o planong hindi gamitin sa 2019, at,
Realignment ng items mula sa proposed 2020 budget.

Kung may pang ibang pagkukunan, please enlighten me, pero after several hours ng paghahanap ng paraan, iyang dalawa lang na yan ang malinaw kong nakikitang source.

Heres where it gets more interesting.

Deciphering the Accounts Chair
Yung savings from unspent items in 2019? Any self-respecting finance professional should have at least a ballpark idea kung magkano aabutin niyan dahil nakalantad na ang 2019 House Budget.

Dapat, alam na yan nina Speaker, di ba?

For one, may confidential-intelligence funds worth P1.07 billion si Speaker Cayetano under the 2019 House budget, or P392 million more than Speaker Arroyos 2018 intel funds worth P 615 million.
Malaking halaga ang diprensiya ng confidential funds nila pero Arroyo was able to survive with just P615 million, so assuming na the ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano can, like Arroyo, get things done using the same amount, e di may P392 million na pwedeng laru-laruin si Speaker Cayetano, tama ba?
If the Cayetano-led House has a rough idea of how much savings will exist by end of 2019, and despite that knowledge e sinabi pa rin ng House Accounts na kulang ang pera kasi hindi expected ang deputy speakerships, so saan kukuha ng karagdagan?

E di sa 2020 budget, tama ba?

Pero... Pero... Pero...
Pero di ba ngat ayon sa proposed 2020 House Budget, bumagsak ang pasweldo sa House plantilla and contractuals, at wala ring allocated for capital outlay, so saan balak kunin ng House leadership ang pampondo doon sa mga bagong deputy speaker, bagong vice-chairmanships, at bagong kumite?

Isa lang ang nakikita ko: MOOE.

Shown below ang breakdown ng Maintenance and Other Operating expenses (MOOE) under New Appropriations by Object of Expenditures:


Makikitang 17 out of the 19 line items sa MOOE e kapareho lang noong isang taon: walang dagdag, walang bawas... pero makikita ring may dalawang lumaki:

""Utility expenses increased by P13 million (P254.6-M vs P245.5-M)
""Professional Services"" increased by P1.64 billion (P4.13-B vs 2.49-B).

Mapapatawad na siguro yung increase sa utility expenses (bills for Meralco, Manila Water, etc.) dahil ayoko naman mapulutan ng kuryente ang batasan, pero kagulat-gulat na P1.64 billion ang increase para sa Professional Services.
Katunog ba siya noong P1.6 billion na binanggit sa balita?
Pwede bang i-lump sum na lang ang P1.64 billion nang ganun-ganun na lang? Kwestiyonable na nga ang P2.49 billion na lump sum for ""Professional Services"" sa 2019 pero talagang kailangan pang sagarin by adding P1.64 billion more (P4.13 billion na ang total) for 2020?

Kung oo, bakit hindi itemized ang mga gastusin at sa halip e lump sum lang? Kung itemized kasi yan, mas malinaw sa taumbayan at sa iba pang mga congressman kung ano ang maaasahang pondo.

Pero kung ganyang lump sum na ire-realign lang, malinaw sa GAB na largely e nasa kamay ng House Speaker ang desisyon kung paano ito gagastusin, tama ba?

The Dangers of Lump Sums
Ilatag ko muna ang analysis diyan at feel free to correct me if Im wrong:

FIRST, ayon mismo sa House Accounts chair, maraming dagdag-gastos dahil sa pag-create ng walong bagong deputy speakerships, bagong commitees, at bagong vice-chairmanships, at hindi nila raw ito expected.

SECOND, may estimate naman ng magiging savings from 2019 at make-carry over ang savings sa 2020, pero sa kabila nito e nagpasya pa rin ang House na magdagdag ng P1.6 billion.

THIRD, sa kabila ng karagdagang gastos e nagbawas pa ang House ng budget para sa pasweldo ng tao at pambili ng equipment, so logic dictates na kailangan ng realignment ng funds from MOOE to personnel services and/or capital outlay.

Given these, heto ang critical na tanong:
Bakit hindi na lang inallocate agad under ""Personnel Services"" o ""Capital Outlay"" ang dagdag na pondo at sa halip e ginawang lump sum under MOOE - Professional Services?
Kung inallocate agad, e di alam na natin kung paano magagastos.

Pero hindi, ginawang lump sum e... lump sum na ang suma total e P4.13 billion na kung gusto ng speaker e pwedeng gamitin for something else na huhulaan na lang natin kung ano, tama ba?

Kahit nga si DepEd Sec. Briones, noong nagsusulat siya tungkol sa lump sums sa Aquino-era budget, na:
All of us know that in the human physical system, presence of lumps is a danger signal.
Let me rephrase the question.
If the ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano intends to spend the P1.6 billion for research, new positions, new offices, and oversight, then why didnt he split the P1.6 billion into four line items? Is it fair to ask why such a gigantic amount appears to be at the mercy of the House Speaker?
Just how much money is in Cayetanos hands?
Judging from his many media interviews so far,  sobrang evasive ni Cayetano pag tinatanong about the budget, kaya wala tayong choice kundi tumingin na lang sa dokumento at mag-deduce mula sa mga iyon.
Hindi naman ako perfectionist. Okey na sa akin yung palusutin ang kaunting ""leakages"" pero wag naman sanang itodo nang bonggang-bongga dahil nakakahiya naman sa taumbayan dahil my gahd I heyt drahgs!
Going back to topic, tulad ng 2020 proposed House Budget ay may identical na DAP-like clauses ang 2018 at 2019 House Budget, i.e.  pwedeng may 2018 funds na carried over to 2019 at 2019 to 2020. Pero partidahan na natin ang 2019 House at sabihing zero savings from last year, i.e. sinimot ni Gloria ang 2018 House Budget.
Actually, mukhang nasimot nga talaga ni Speaker Arroyo ang funds nila noong 2018, as suggested by screenshot ng Notes to Financial Statements sa 2018 CoA Report on the House:


So sige, sabihin na lang natin na walang na-carry over na funds from 2018.

Sa kabila ng assumption na ito, tumaas pa rin ang kilay ko nang makita ang 2019 House Budget dahil may P1.07 billion na confidential funds pala ang House Speaker for 2019.

Confidential funds yung pondong halos walang accounting, i.e. pork barrel ng Speaker, di ba?
Partida, hindi pa kasama diyan ang mga pwedeng i-realign ng Speaker from the 2019 House Budget basta at kung gugustuhin niya.

2019 GAA shows Speaker Cayetano got P1.07 billion in confidential funds, or about Php 392 million more than the P615 million his predecessor had in 2018.
Ganito kasi yan. Hindi naman kasalanan ni Cayetano na P1.07 billion ang confidential funds niya for 2019 dahil hindi naman siya kasama sa mga nagpasa niyan. In short, congratulations para kay Speaker Cayetano dahil nachambahan niya ang ganyang ka-bonggang 2019 slush fund.

Pero ngayong House ""Speaker na Tapat"" na siya, bakit siya humihingi ng P1.07 billion ulit for 2020, tulad ng natanggap niya ngayong 2019?


Yun pa nga lang P1.07 billion na pwedeng laruin ni Speaker Cayetano for 2019, nakapagtataka na kasi P615 million lang ang allocated sa previous na speaker. Pero imbes na babaan ni ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano ang confidential funds niya for 2020, inulit lang niya ang P1.07 billion?

House Speaker Gloria Arroyo, who Cayetano accused as corrupt, had only P615 million in confidential funds for 2018.
Aanhin kaya ni Speaker Cayetano ang ganoong kalaking pera samantalang si Gloria, na pinaratangang kurakot ni Cayetano, e nakatiis sa P615 billion lang?
Mas marami pang magagastos na public funds si ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano kaysa sa tinawag niyang kurakot?
Pero hindi pa nakuntento sa P1.07 billion kaya dinagdagan pa ng P1.64 billion na lump sum, ganon ba?


Kung may extra P1.64 billion na lump sum sa loob ng Professional Services ang 2020 House Budget, at idagdag pa natin ang reinstated na P1.07 billion na confidential funds ng House Speaker, e di may hindi bababa sa 1.07 + 1.6 = 2.67 billion na pwedeng laruin ang House Speaker sa 2020 at bukod pa yan sa at least P1.07 billion na nilalaro na niya ngayong 2019, tama ba?

Tama bang sabihing si Speaker Cayetano ay may 1.07 + 1.07 + 1.64 = 3.78 billion na combined outright and de facto na slush funds?

Aanhin niya ang lahat ng public funds na yun ng isang ""Speaker na Tapat""?
Hindi ba't pag ""Speaker na Tapat"" e mas matipid dapat?
If he's an honest Speaker, at kurakot sabi niya ang last speaker, di ba dapat e mas matipid siya?

E bakit balde-balde ang inilaki ang hawak ni Speaker Cayetano na Pera ng Bayan samantalang kinaya naman ng isang kurakot na suportahan ang pangulo sa hamak na mas mababang halaga?

May dagdag-bayad ba pag ""Speaker na Tapat""?

Matutupad ba ang term-sharing deal?
Recall na mayroong  gentlemans agreement between Cayetano and Rep. Velasco na term-sharing, kung saan ""Speaker na Tapat"" daw si Cayetano for the 1st 15 months tapos si Velasco sa remaining 21 months.

Pero kung bubusisiin ang budget ng Kongreso, parang may hindi nagtutugma.

Heto't pasadahan natin ng isang mabilis-bilis.

Despite increased costs arising from the new positions created under Cayetano (8 deputy speakerships, new committees, new vice-chairmanships), bumaba ang nakalaang pondo para sa pasweldo ng tauhan at pambili ng property and equipment, pero hindi naman siguro papayag ang mga kongresista sa budget cut, di ba?

That means Cayetano will fund these new positions via realignment, right?

At kung realignment technique na gagamitin, ibig non e dapat sumipsip ang karaniwang kongresista kay Cayetano para tuparin niya ang realignment, tama?
Alam niyo naman ang ""Speaker na Tapat"" na si Cayetano pag nagtampo, parang batang inagawan ng kendi, as illustrated by his juvenile response (Boo-hoo! Axe to grind!) sa questions about the extra P1.6 billion budget, di ba?
Kung blogger pa lang ba bumira sa kanya tapos e nagkaganyan nam paano pa kung kongresista na hawak ng ""Speaker na Tapat"" sa leeg?

Kung kongresista ka at hawak ng ""Speaker na Tapat""  sa leeg ang budget ng opisina mo, paano gagawin mo pag matatapos na ang 15 months at magbobotohan na for a new speaker, maging ang new speaker man e si Lord Alan Velasco o si Martin Romualdez o kahit pa yung mga baliw-baliwang pulang party-list?
Matatapos ang 15 months ni Speaker Cayetano sa umpisa ng October 2020, which is the year kung saan gagamitin ang budget na kinekwestiyon natin ngayon.

Kung ako'y isang gahaman na speaker at meron akong bilyon-bilyon na pwedeng paglaruan, sisiguraduhin kong mabibili ko ang loyalty ng kahit kalahati man lang ng House para sigurado akong hindi ako matatanggal bilang Speaker.

Kung mayroon akong 2 billion, at kailangan kong manligaw ng 150 na kongresista, e di alam ko na ang gagawin. #AlamNaThis

Sa palagay ko, hindi naman baliw si Cayetano na mag-asam pa ng presidency sa 2022 kasi ngayon pa nga lang e President of the House pa lang e hirap na hirap na siya.

If I were in Caytanos shoes, Id be more interested in keeping the House Speakership, dahil far more realistic at immediate yon kaysa presidente ng Pilipinas.

Correct me if I'm wrong but with a possible P2.74 billion na slush fund (at idagdag pa P1.07 intel funds for 2019), he has around P3.81 billion (or even more) at his disposal from now until the time na kailangan nang mag-botohan ng bagong speaker, tama?

What will Cayetano do with those billions?
If Speaker Cayetano wants to keep true to his promise na hell be an honest speaker, then why didnt he itemize the budget and instead allowed a lump sum na P1.64 billion to be added, a lump sum that he, if he so wishes, can be realigned to pretty much wherever he wants?

Kung may 1.07 billion times two ako na confidential funds, ano ba naman yung maglaan ako ng kapiraso noon para sa social media counter-attack?

Will Cayetano suddenly mature, stop being a crybaby like when he threatened Inday Sara na sisirain niya ang Duterte Coalition kung susuportahan ni Inday si Velasco, and allow the next speaker to take over?

Will Cayetano suddenly mature, stop being a crybaby like when he didnt mind attacking a woman to further his political goals (as exposed by Pulong Duterte), and allow the next speaker to take over?

Will Cayetano be so honest that he will NEVER use his bilions in intel funds (P1.07 billion times 2) and other de facto slush funds just to stay as speaker?

We, as taxpayers, deserve an answer.

Pero siyempre, hindi magagawa ni Cayetano na manloko ng taumbayan kasi nga, di ba, ""Speaker na Tapat"" siya?",RJ Nieto,10/02/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/10/i-saw-speaker-na-tapat-cayetanos-2020.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"EXTRA P1.6-B HOUSE BUDGET: CAYETANOS NEGATIVE PREGNANT DEFENSE VS ""FAKE NEWS""","Let's thoroughly dissect the House budget issue and Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano's excruciatingly problematic defense. Nililihis ang istorya e. Akala siguro e makalulusot.

On 20 Sept 2019, House Accounts Committee chair and Cavite Rep. Bambol Tolentino told GMA News that that the House seeks P1.6-billion on top of its original proposed P14-billion budget for 2020. 

Tolentino said:
We did not expect that there will be additional Deputy Speaker; we did not expect that there will be additional vice chairpersons on [House Committees] on Appropriations and Ways and Means; we did not expect either that there will be newly created committees We are talking about all the employees, over 4,000, including those who are in a contractual status, permanents and other employees.
I found this alarming on several grounds

FIRST, WHY NEED FOR MORE EXPENSIVE DEPUTY SPEAKERSHIPS?
The sheer number of deputy speakers as the House had only:
ONE deputy speaker from 1946 to 1995
TWO deputy speakers from 1995 to 1998
FOUR to SIX deputy speakers from 1998 to 2016
FOURTEEN deputy speakers from 2016 to 2019
While there was a radical increase of deputy speakers during the 17th Congress under the leadership of Speaker Bebot Alvarez (and subsequently, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo), I was willing to tolerate it given that PRRD really had to curry the favor of the House.


The Liberal Party was the single biggest power bloc in the 300-member 2016 House. Given that the President had a lot on his legislative agenda that needed massive congressional support, I understood and recognized the political reality that he needs to bring them to his side, hence the jump from six deputy speakers in the 16th Congress to fourteen in the 17th.

Come 2019, however, the Presidents own PDP-Laban (where PRRD belongs) and Nacionalista (where Speaker Cayetano belongs) dominated the elections with 94 and 37 congressional seats each. Adding the generally pro-administration NPCs 33 seats and NUPs 28 seats, the total number of administration-aligned congressmen is 192, a clear supermajority.

Alvarez in 2016 increased the number of deputies by 8 (from 6 to 14) because most of the solons are anti-administration. That I would understand because I recognize political realities.

And in fairness to the 17th Congress, their performance is far better than their predecessors, in as far as supporting the Presidents legislative agenda.

But unlike 2016, a pro-administration supermajority already won in 2019, so what necessitated Cayetanos decision to add eight more (from 14 to 22)?

It wouldve been understandable if Cayetano merely retained the 14 deputy speakership positions from the last Congress, but why did he need to create eight more?

While were at it, I would not have cared if Cayetano made deputy speakers out of all the 300 solons if not for the fact that each deputy speaker requires additional funds that come from guess what?

PUBLIC FUNDS. Public funds that couldve been used for healthcare, agriculture, education, infrastructure and social services instead or public funds that couldve been saved to minimize the countrys ballooning budget deficit.
This is issue is quite similar to the Dengvaxia Scandal.Was P3.5 billion for an experimental vaccine the best use of public funds? Similarly, is P1.6 billion additional House budget the best use of public funds?
SECOND, 11-B WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO WHY 4.6-B MORE?
The 17th Congress under Speakers Alvarez and Arroyo were able to pass ALL of PRRDs legislative measures with a 2018 budget of just Php 11 billion. If the that House can accomplish the task with that amount, why do we have to increase it?

As shown in a 03 June 2019 infographic posted in Thinking Pinoy, the House of Representatives under GMA (and predecessor Alvarez) passed ALL of PRRD's 28 priority bills... and they had only a P11-B budget in 2018.

Fine, theres inflation, so lets say we should increase the House budget by 10% annually to neutralize rising costs, but that means that the 2019 budget must be only Php 12.1 billion, and 2020 only Php 13.31 billion.

The House, according to Rep. Tolentino, initially asked for Php 14 billion and I think that I can tolerate the extra Php 690 million on top of Php 13.31 billion projection. However, what I do not understand is why the House had to increase the budget even further, to the tune of P1.6 billion pesos.

Again, if Alvarez and Gloria whose House was initially anti-PRRD were able to pass all needed laws with just Php 11 billion, why does Cayetano, whose House is overwhelmingly pro-PRRD, asking for Php 14 billion + Php 1.6 billion  Php 11 billion = Php 4.6 billion more?

Speaker Cayetano, the House today are already allies, so why did you feel the need for more political accommodations?

THIRD, BREAKING DOWN THE P1.6-B
Recall that Rep. Tolentino, who handles House finances, said the P1.6-B will be to fund the following:
new deputy speakerships
new committees
new vice-chairs, and
employee salaries.
Now, if there are X employee positions in 2019, then the House in preparing its 2020 budget must take into account salaries for those X number of employee positions, regardless of whos occupying them. That is, the initial P14-B must already take into account the salary expenses of the current set of positions.

In short, we could only surmise that the employee salaries that Tolentino mentioned are for NEW regular and contractual positions. That is, logic dictates that the P1.6-B is intended for:
NEW deputy speakerships
NEW committees
NEW vice-chairs, and
NEW employees.
NEW. NEW. NEW. NEW. Yes, thats four NEWs out of four.

This brings us back to the second point. The Arroyo-Alvarez House managed to pass ALL of PRRDs legislative measures WITHOUT these NEW positions, and they passed the measures so fast the Philippine Star even accused the Arroyo-Alvarez House of being the rubber stamp of Malacaang.

If P11-B 2018 House budget can already buy what the Star calls a rubber stamp congress, what necessitated the extra 4.6?

I can smell only one thing: political accommodation.

Again, political accommodation, while ideally reprehensible, is in my opinion tolerable if done at the minimum but where does Cayetano draw the line?
 
CAYETANOS NEGATIVE PREGNANT REBUTTAL
The initial GMA News report was on 20 September 2019, and Cayetano encountered an avalance of criticisms shortly thereafter.

Responding to criticisms over the P1.6 billion issue, Speaker Cayetano said:
For the past two days, may mga nangungulit about, actually fake news 'yung nasa isang blogger na sinabi niyang we added P1.6 billion for the 22 deputy speakers. We used to have 14 deputy speakers, we now have 22. If we're going to add P1.6 billion for additional 8 deputy speakers, that's P200 million for every deputy speaker Ang problema sa blogger na 'to  aside from [having an] axe to grind sa akin  hindi man lang tiningnan 'yung actual records ng Congress or 'yung news.
Lets dissect Cayetanos problematic response. Note that you must already know who that blogger is.

Despite the typically verbose speaking style, Speaker Cayetano said only two things:
That the blogger is criticizing him only because the former has an axe to grind.
Its not true that each new deputy speaker will get Php 200 million.
The first statement is nothing but a personal attack that is unbecoming of a government official. The same issue is being raised by OTHER people, including his predecessor DFA Sec. Perfecto Yasay.

Speaker Cayetano, act with the dignity of someone in your position, and recognize your responsibility to the Filipino People, the same Filipino People who are funding your politics. If you can't be civil and professional when facing criticisms, you do not deserve to be there.


As for the second point, what we see here is a clear case of a negative pregnant statement, which is extremely disappointing because Cayetanos a lawyer who should know better than a college dropout blogger hes referring to.
The Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute defines a negative pregnant statement as a denial of wrongdoing done by denying only an aspect of the allegation, but not the allegation itself.
Cayetano issued an invalid denial. As explained in the previous sections:
The primary criticism against the extra P1.6-B budget is its apparent lack of necessity.
The secondary criticism is that it will be used to fund new positions, especially the 8 new deputy speakerships.
Hence, a valid denial must:
Decisively show that the P1.6-B is necessary to further PUBLIC AND NOT PERSONAL INTERESTS.
That the amounts allocated for the new positions are reasonable in light of the fact that other government spending priorities (education, healthcare, etc) could have gotten the funding instead.
But instead of addressing the issue head-on, Speaker Cayetano tried to weasel his way out by misrepresenting the criticism and rebutting the same misrepresentation.
Cayetano said P200-million-for-each-deputy is incorrect, but he didnt say exactly how much will go to them. If each new deputy gets only 199 million, then 200 million is indeed incorrect, right?

But would that make everything fine? Hell no. 

CAYETANOS MEDIA BLITZ
To be fair to Cayetano, he attempted to expound on the budget issue as seen in other news reports later that day. The problem, however, is he still dodged the core questions.

In an UNTV report, Cayetano said that of the P1.6-B additional budget, the big chunk is for various projects while only a little portion is for deputy speakers.


Cayetano didnt define what big and little means. So how much, exactly?

Lawyers like Speaker Cayetano are trained to be instinctively precise with their wording, so his resorting to such ambiguous terms is surprising, to say the least.

This is P1.6-B of public money were talking about, and the best adjectives he can come up with is big and little?

How much, Speaker Cayetano, EXACTLY how much? You love quoting the Bible but you can't even quote official congressional records that are already at your fingertips?
In another report from the Inquirer, Cayetano said:
So, whats one-billion na idadagdag mo sa (that will be added to) Congress to make sure that the 4.1-trillion is spent very well?
But this statement merely complicates Cayetanos predicament. 


Cayetano has not even sufficiently explained the necessity behind the augmentation yet here he is weaseling his way out of the issue.

Speaker Cayetano, you spent an entire day yesterday just to talk, yet you didnt even find time to publish the itemized breakdown of the extra P1.6 billion youre asking for.

ITEMIZE them!
Legislators like you are so anal-retentive and obsessive-compulsive when scrutinizing the budget of the executive and judiciary, yet when it comes to defending your own budget,big chunk and little portion are good enough for you?
Whats one billion, you ask?
One billion... No... One-point-six billion pesos can save and improve a big number of little Filipino lives.
Classrooms. Public School Teachers. Government Doctors. Public Nurses. Reformation of Youth Offenders. Agricultural Subsidies. Drug Rehabilitation Centers. Supplies for the Police and Military. Public Information Systems. Airports. Roads. Bridges. Coast Guard Vesels to patrol the South China Sea. The list goes on and on.
Mr. Speaker, there are so many ways to spend the ""big"" Php 1.6 billion to directly benefit ""little"" Filipinos.
Seriously, Speaker Cayetano, what have the Filipino People done to deserve you?",RJ Nieto,09/24/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/extra-p-1.6-b-house-budget-cayetano-deputy-speaker.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Perception in politics is as important as Reality,"Politics is a game of Perception where whats really taking place may be different from what the public thinks is happening, and anyone who enters the political arena should know this by heart. A public official, whether elective or appointive, should not only be qualified (Reality) but also look qualified (Perception).

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 07 September 2019].


To illustrate, US domestic support for the 2003 war in Iraq was possible after the Bush administration managed to make the public believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (Perception), even if it didnt (Reality), something that the no less than the Bush administration admitted years later but not before the US had taken over Iraq, killed Sadam, taken control of the countrys massive oil resources, and in the process left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead.

Form (Perception) is more important than substance (Reality) in the game of political survival, at least in the short- to medium-term. The sad reality in politics is that Perception takes precedence over Reality, and its the job of every public official to minimize the gap between the two.


Case Study: PCOO Asec. Mocha Uson


Lets consider the case of former Presidential Communications (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Margaux Mocha Uson.

With over five million followers, Uson was hands-down considered the most powerful politically inclined blogger. At an astronomically distant second was Thinking Pinoy of yours truly, which at the time had a measly 600,000 followers, or just about 12 percent of Usons.


Presumably in cognizance of her online supremacy, President Rodrigo Duterte made her PCOO assistant secretary for social media in May, 2017.


Even before her appointment, Uson was already a threat to mainstream medias long-held supremacy over political discourse, and her appointment only managed to amplify the threat. Media outlets relentlessly attacked her, pressuring her Malacaang peers (who are scared stiff of mainstream media) to keep a disproportionately healthy distance from her.

To be fair, its not like media totally had no reason to do so  Uson did commit numerous gaffes that can be (and were) used as excellent fodder for mainstream medias cannon, the cannon that was always aimed and ready to fire at her. For example, Usons Mayon sa Naga, Pepe-dede-ralismo, and sign language scandals did nothing but further alienate her from erstwhile staunch allies.


In fairness, Uson earnestly attempted to do her job well. Her uncanny ability to reach the masses (Reality), however, shouldve been supplemented by efforts to mitigate her negative image among her peers (Perception), especially those who have power over her. Her political success, after all, is contingent not only on her performance, but also on the cooperation she enjoys from other officials.

Uson eventually resigned from office to lodge a congressional bid, and it seems that her image as a political pariah in the Palace even spilled outside Malacaangs walls.

For one, Usons staunchest allies  the Cayetanos of Taguig  didnt even openly and actively support her unsuccessful congressional campaign in their home city, as evidenced by her AA Kasosyo snagging only 0.63 percent of the approximately 300,000 votes cast there. Did the Cayetanos exclude AA Kasosyo in their sample ballots because they see her inclusion as a net political liability?

Uson is undoubtedly very popular but AA Kasosyo was over 70,000 votes short of the cutoff after garnering only 120,000 votes nationwide, or less than 2% of her 5.8 million followers today.

The Case of Nicanor Faeldon and GCTA
Recently resigned Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon is another example of the chasm between Perception and Reality.

The President recently fired Faeldon and said in a mix of English and Tagalog, Faeldon has to go because Faeldon disobeyed my order I was trying to provide the fire extinguisher to erase the peoples doubts. No releases. If he said that then, it shouldve been over. The problem is he came up the next day with his statement with his statement with his own computation.

The President, an astute politician, was essentially trying to balance Reality with Perception.

The Reality is that the GCTA Law was enacted and implemented well before Duterte took office. In the absence of any amendment to the law or any court order, Faeldon had no choice but to help implement it in the same way Senator Leila de Lima did while still in DOJ.

The Duterte Administration is aware of this reality, as evidenced by Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarras earlier statement that convicted murderer Mayor Antonio Sanchez may benefit from GCTA just like any other convict.

But the GCTA issue two faces: legal (Reality) and public opinion (Perception). Duterte as Chief Executive had to balance his responsibility to execute the law and as a politician had to keep the public satisfied, hence his decision to put GCTA on hold.

Faeldon, instead of recognizing this glaring political necessity, ignored the Presidents orders and handled matters his own way and his glaring lack of public relations skills made the situation even worse.

Faeldon focused too much Reality and failed to sufficiently address Perception and that didnt sit well with a President who recognizes, in this situation, that Perception is just as important as Reality.

Hence Faeldons termination.",RJ Nieto,09/14/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-perception-in-politics-is-as.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Personal advocacies and the ABCD of politics,"The relative political calm in the months after the May, 2019, elections has come to an end: sentence reductions for convicted felons, the SOGIE bill, South China Sea tensions, Death Penaltys revival, the Communist insurgencythe list goes on and on.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 31 August 2019].

I have my own take on each of these issues and I have been quite vocal on most of them through my Facebook page ThinkingPinoy. More than just promoting my own views through this column, however, I feel that its more important, at least for now, to help everyone get back on track by sharing with my readers the four principles I generally follow when I publicly speak my mind.

Dont get me wrong: I admit that I oftentimes fail to adhere to them, but I try to stick to them as best as I can. I think I am already done with the days when I approached issues with unbridled anger. After years of being in the public scene, I learned that moderation is key.

I noticed, throughout the years, that my efforts yielded better results whenever I seriously take into consideration the principles that Im about to list down.


First, Politics is Addition.
We live in a democracy where popular opinion is the primary determinant of political advocacies, i.e., advocates should be able to gain popular support. But just like what I tell my friends over and over, you cant convince someone to switch to your side if the first thing you do is piss him off.

A balanced mix of passion, knowledge, and compassion is crucial in every advocacy, and too much of one thing  and too little of another  can sabotage the entire endeavor. Advocates are passionate and theyre usually knowledgeable about the subject, but a lot of them fail because they forget that compassion is just as important, compassion not only for the ones theyre fighting for, but also to those who they are fighting against.

Proving to yourself that youre right is one thing, but making others see it the same way is an entirely different matter, and that leads us to


Second, Politics is Belonging.
Political debates are usually a zero-sum game, where one sides gain is the other sides loss and we all know that losses generate resentment, resentment that may rear its ugly head when the next political issue comes along.

We can avoid this by showing opponents that all of us are mostly on the same side. Advocates should appeal not to their opponents position, but to their interests. See how a policy proposal can benefit its opponents, and explain this to them. For policy proposal that seem to benefit a few, explain how benefitting a few will, even in the long run, benefit the majority.

Third, Politics is Compromise.
I know for a fact that I cannot get everything I want, and I believe the same holds true for everyone else. We all have differing political interests and the way to go forward is finding a way to set policies that optimally reconcile these clashing desires. No single law is perfect: law inherently is a compromise subscribed to by millions of citizens with different ways of viewing the world.

As Norman Vincent Peale once said, Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youll land among the stars. Advocates should learn that compromise is a core aspect of politics, and achieving a less-than-ideal outcome is so much better than maintaining the status quo.


Simply shocking the system into submission usually requires bloody revolutions, and Im not really fond of those gory stuff.

Societal advancement is a process of iterative development where a society adopts less-than-ideal solution after less-than-ideal solution, in the hope that these successive incremental improvements will allow it to go nearer to its ideal state of affairs.

The world is imperfect and it always will be, but we can make it less so.

Fourth, Politics is Divisive.
Most importantly, I find it really odd that even some political analysts decry the divisiveness of Philippine politics, when the fact of the matter is that politics by nature is divisive. Has there ever been a time in Philippine History when ALL political factions united as one? Even when our forefathers fought against Spanish colonization, divisiveness existed among our own ranks: Emilio Aguinaldo himself readily confessed that he ordered Andres Bonifacios execution.

Instead viewing the divisiveness of politics like its some sort of temporal anomaly, we need to see it as a democratic political reality, and the primary task of every self-proclaimed advocate is to minimize it, or its ill effects at least. Nobody can eliminate divisiveness, but we can take the divisiveness down a notch. Case in point is the latest trust and approval ratings of the sitting President.

I know some may accuse me of hypocrisy after reading this article, but even Hitler saying the moon is round doesnt make it flat.",RJ Nieto,09/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-personal-advocacies-and-abcd-of.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Duterte Youths Cardema vs Comelecs Guanzon,"Over the past several weeks, weve been witness to the word war between former National Youth Commission and Duterte Youth party-list nominee Ronald Cardema and Comelec commissioner Rowena Guanzon, with the core issue being Cardemas eligibility as Duterte Youths first nominee.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 24 August 2019.]


Comelec on one hand sees Duterte Youth, as its name suggests, a youth sector party-list, so that the age limit on nominees (no older than 30 years by law) apply. The 34-year-old Cardema, meanwhile, argues that the party represents young professionals (yuppies), who are generally defined as professionals in their 20s or 30s.

Cardema has always been a controversial figure but the rift formally started in late May when Guanzon questioned Cardemas eligibility. This is after Duterte Youth petitioned to replace the five original nominees with a new set where Cardema is on top. The Comelec in early June approved the substitution but Guanzon in her dissenting opinion raised the age issue.

A media war happened afterward, and it escalated to new levels when Guanzon in a mid-July tweet published an alleged text threat along with the comment Who do you think sent this? Obviously. The public felt Guanzon was alluding to Cardema, an allegation Cardema swiftly denied.

The Comelec in early August cancelled Cardemas nomination on grounds of age.

A little later, Cardema accused Guanzon of extortion as he claimed she asked him for a large sum and the appointment of several officials. Guanzon shrugged off the allegations.

Cardema and Guanzon threatened to sue each other, with Cardema going the extra mile by blaming Guanzons tirades for making his relatives sick.

Cardema then publicly requested for the Palaces help, a request that the Palace swiftly denied.

Cardemas motion for reconsideration is still pending and he told this writer in a recent (and quite lengthy) phone conversation that he is still hopeful that it will be granted.

Guanzon, meanwhile, is on a roll. We have to give the commissioner some credit: she has a knack for zingers that Cardema sorely lacks.


All things considered, I cannot help but view the odds are stacked against Cardema while Guanzon has basically nothing to lose. That is, the current political landscape vis--vis the Guanzon-Cardema rift suggests that Cardemas moves over the past several months may have been a series of gargantuan political miscalculations.

FIRST, Guanzon has little to lose. This is just one of the myriad electoral cases Guanzon handles and she will remain a commissioner no matter how this turns out.


Impeachment is a political exercise so that Cardemas impeachment raps versus Guanzon are unlikely to prosper, as major blocs in both Houses are not exactly fond of Cardema. Moreover, will the Palace be willing to sideline its legislative agenda for the Senate to conduct months worth of impeachment trial? I highly doubt it.

SECOND, Cardema has limited political capital.

Guanzons July tweet may have been construed as alluding to Cardema but Guanzon didnt specifically refer to him, offering her the option to exercise plausible deniability. Cardema, however, took the bait and publicly retaliated with little success.

Guanzon, in just one tweet, managed to expose the limitations of Cardemas political capital.

In a world of rainbows, butterflies, unicorns, and teletubbies, everything boils to down to a question of morality. But reality dictates that most political agreements are quid pro quo, i.e., you scratch my back, I scratch yours. What exactly can Cardema offer that will overwhelm the overwhelming opportunity costs?

THIRD, Cardemas evidence will likely backfire.

Days after he initially accused Guanzon of extortion, Cardema released a series of screenshots that purportedly showed his text conversations with Guanzons alleged bagman in Congress. Cardema redacted the names, phone numbers, and numerous other parts of the exchange, thus raising questions regarding authenticity.

If anything, the screenshots may likely backfire on Cardema because the screenshots are essentially declarations against interest. One of the screenshots show that Cardema agreed to the lobby for the appointments of several people in exchange for a favorable Comelec decision, which sounds like a budding corruption case against Cardema.

Cardemas biggest mistake? Cardema didnt wait, even if a few weeks is all the waiting he had to do. If he just allowed the original first nominee to sit as congressman first then told her to withdraw a day later, the issue wouldve been under the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal instead of Comelec, and he has better chances there.

But he didnt, so here we are.",RJ Nieto,09/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-duterte-youths-cardema-vs.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Policy suggestions to prevent the recruitment of Filipino youth into rebel groups,"Several parents of senior high school students testified in a series of Senate hearings that leftist groups believed to fronts for the communist insurgent New Peoples Army (NPA) are recruiting their children. And true enough, some of kids really went to the mountains and have become combatants for the rebel group.

I disagree with Leftist ideologies (I consider myself a Centrist) but I recognize every persons right to have her own political views. Advocacy of leftist ideologies is not by itself illegal, but it should stop when its about to lead our youth, most especially our very impressionable minors, into a life of violence.

Whenever I point out a problem, I always try to propose a solution.

Thus, here are several policy recommendations in relation to the issue:

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 17 August 2019].


FIRST, the state can set additional limitations on minors right to freedom of association.

The state recognizes the reality young Filipinos are not yet fully capable of independently making marriage decisions, so the Family Code (EO 209 s. 1987) requires adults aged 18 to 21 to secure notarized parental consent before they are legally allowed to marry.

The decision to go to the mountains and take up arms against the Government is much more serious than deciding to settle down. Just like what the Family Code with respect to marriage, the state can exercise parens patriae jurisdiction over our youth, to prevent them from making decisions that may destroy their future.

SECOND, schools can dissolve campus organizations that are known to advocate sedition and violence.

Liberality of school administrations vary widely but I believe that we can all agree that advocacy of illegal acts like sedition and rebellion is out of the question. Schools must immediately dissolve campus orgs as soon as they call for, say, the downfall of the government (e.g. Ibagsak!). DepEd and CHED, meanwhile, can take appropriate action against schools that neglect to do so.

THIRD, revoke legal recognition for organizations that encourage illegal acts.

Similar to the suggestion to schools, let us enable the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revoke the corporate registration of organizations that are known to call for the governments downfall. Criticizing the government and its policies is one thing, but to call for its utter destruction is another. While were at it, it may be high time to amend the Party-list Act (RA 7941) to exclude organizations that are known to advocate violence, or known to vocally support and/or tolerate groups that do so.


FOURTH, inclusion of insurgency-related topics in primary and secondary education.

Being a native of rural Bulacan, I was aware of massive NPA presence in Doa Remedios Trinidad town in the early 1990s because elders talk about it all the time. But thats about it. I didnt know that they extorted revolutionary taxes from innocent small businessmen, that they burn farm machinery, etc. Our children should be made aware of these things so they can make better decisions when NPA recruiters approach them later in life.


The government should also use its mass media assets to disseminate such information. Sadly, the Presidents own communications team (PCOO) does nothing significant in this regard. To this day, I have yet to see anything on TV, radio, print, or online that even remotely dissuades kids from joining the NPA. I strongly believe that its more important for PCOO to explain the scourge of violent resistance to Filipinos than to Bosnians.

FIFTH, amend the Human Security Act and the Anti-money Laundering Act (AMLA).

Section 18 of the Human Security Act (RA 9372) can be amended to extend the period of detention without Judicial Warrant of Arrest from just three days to at least a week for terrorism suspects.

Terrorism is best proven by retracing paper trails, and three days is simply too short for it. Imagine a terrorist that was arrested on a Friday night. Banks are closed during the weekends so law enforcement will have only one day (thats a Monday) to do all the work. Thats impossible.


With that said, AMLA should also be amended to include an exception on the predicate crime requirement if the offense is terrorism, albeit with additional safeguards to prevent authorities from using this for politicking. To this end, we can set harsher penalties for authorities who use AMLA-sourced anti-terrorism information for purposes other than countering terrorism.

To this day, I have yet to learn of persons in their late 20s or 30s who somehow had an epiphany of sorts and decided to join the NPA. In my best knowledge, NPAs new recruits are mostly those in their late teens and early twenties, i.e., young adults who are desperate to find meaning in their existence and to find their place in this world.

Lets build a framework that allows these children to learn that there are far better choices than taking up arms and shooting fellow Filipinos, because I know for a fact that there are.",RJ Nieto,09/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-policy-suggestions-to-prevent.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#TPonMB: Health Sec. Duque, lets respect FDAs independence","Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque recently announced that hell consult with the UP-PGH Dengvaxia Task Force regarding the possible reintroduction of the controversial anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, saying he wants a decision on Dengvaxias fate through a consensus among all sectors because a lot of groups have varying positions about this.

But before we go any further, heres some context.
[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 10 August 2019].

The 2017 Dengvaxia scandal stemmed from the haphazard DOH-led mass vaccination program affecting almost a million school-age children. Despite Sanofis own studies admitting that the drug may have serious adverse effects on recipients who have not had dengue, DOH still mass vaccinated in 2016 and 2017 4th graders in Central Luzon, Metro Manila, and Calabarzon.

The Scandal erupted in November, 2017, when Sanofi through a press release admitted that Dengvaxia worsens dengue symptoms in recipients who have no prior history of dengue, thereby confirming Sanofis earlier statement prior to the mass vaccination program, which Sanofi published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2015.

Hundreds of vaccine recipients have allegedly died so far, with Public Attorneys Office (PAO) autopsy reports show that most of the kids exhibited swelling and bleeding in their internal organs, which eventually led to multi-organ failure. The affected families, with PAOs help, have filed cases against DOH, manufacturer Sanofi, and local distributor Zuellig Pharma.

The cases are still pending in various courts and Sanofi has consistently denied liability over these deaths.
After Sanofi failed to submit mandatory post-marketing surveillance reports, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permanently revoked Dengvaxias Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) in February this year, making it illegal in the country.

Hence, I cannot understand why a health secretary is so actively involving himself over an illegal drug that is not even part of the Philippine National Formulary, the official list of drugs that the DOH is legally allowed to procure.


Criminal liability on the part of DOH, Sanofi, and Zuellig, in relation to the mass vaccination program, is a matter that the courts are already handling and lets allow them to decide on it. The issue at, is the propriety of the reinstatement of Dengvaxias CPR and subsequently, the question of who are the right persons to be involved its reinstatement.

Manufacturer Sanofi by nature wants Dengvaxias CPR reinstated, but its also clear that Congress mandated the FDA and no one else to review such submissions and Sec. Duque isnt in FDA.

As a side note, this writer also finds it odd that Dengvaxia advocate and former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral has been doing media rounds lately without disclosing in any of those interviews that she is a trustee of the Zuellig Family Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Dengvaxia local distributor Zuellig Pharmaceuticals.

Former Philippine College of Physicians president Dr. Tony Leachon is right when he recently asked whether Sanofi has already submitted the post-marketing surveillance reports, as those missing reports are what made the FDA revoke Dengvaxias CPR in the first place.

If it still hasnt submitted these reports, then the debate is over. Otherwise, its up to the FDA and FDA alone to independently review these reports, check for compliance, and decide whether to reinstate Dengvaxias registration or not. With that said, this writer cant help but feel sympathy for the UP-PGH professionals who are now under extreme and unnecessary pressure.

If Sec. Duque insists on dipping his hands into the issue, then he must at least make public Sanofis missing post-surveillance reports that it must have submitted recently. The secretary should let the public see what Sanofi has to say about the hundreds of thousands of kids that, as Senator Richard Gordon put it, were treated like guinea pigs.

Dengvaxias proponents argue that the drug may be sufficiently safe for those who have had dengue, and this writer agrees with them. However, if Dengvaxia must be reinstated, then it must be reinstated with clear guidelines on how it should administered, taking into account data collected over the past three years that it was available in the market, the same data that can be found only in Sanofis post-marketing surveillance reports, the same reports that are still missing, apparently.

Sec. Duque is strongly encouraged to let the FDA do its job without undue external interference. FDA officer-in-charge Usec. Eric Domingo is more than capable of accomplishing that, especially since he hails from Pampanga, one of the provinces covered by the botched 2017 Dengvaxia mass vaccination Program.

Sec. Duque must focus only on tasks that he is legally allowed to do, and that doesnt include FDAs job. Truth be told, Sec. Duques latest moves may even be construed as engaging in acts beyond his authority to perform, opening him up to possible lawsuits from the FDA and even from any citizen who feels that the secretarys actions are endangering public safety.",RJ Nieto,09/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-health-sec-duque-lets-respect.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#TPonMB: What, exactly, is a legitimate journalist?","As I write my first column piece, I think its best to introduce myself first.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 03 August 2019].


My name is Rey Joseph Nieto, best known as the publisher of the Facebook page Thinking Pinoy (TP) with over 1.4 million organic followers. I also a co-host the radio show Karambola, which airs weekdays 8 to 10 am on DWIZ 882 AM. And yes, I am that chubby controversial resource person in the October 2017 Senate hearing on fake news.

I am aware that social media is not the be-all and end-all of public discourse, hence my decision to start writing a column for one of the countrys most esteemed publications. And I am eternally grateful to Manila Bulletins senior editors for giving me this opportunity.

While were at it, I also wish to thank my mentors, the former SunStar Davao editor-in-chief Stella Estremera, Philippine News Agency director Gigie Agtay, and former Manila Standard editor-in-chief Jojo Robles (bless his soul): I would not have gone this far without you.

Now, lets get it on.
For the past three years, weve been witnesses to what appears to be a war for public recognition among media practitioners. On one side are new social media-based political personalities who enjoy massive online followings, and on the other are traditional journalists who benefit from massive distribution networks of their media outlets.

I now find this extremely ironic because I am a social media personality on one hand and with this first column piece, a traditional media man on the other. But just like what my late mentor Jojo Robles always told me, A journalist should never be his own story.


Let me cite a prime example, though I shall conceal her name because what matters here is the script and not the actor.

A few days ago, a traditional journalist publicly complained on social media about the Department of Transportations (DoTr) supposed preferential treatment, as the latter allegedly allowed a handful of media outlets, while preventing others, to cover the bidding on the New Manila International Airport. She also accused the agency of favoring social media personalities over, in her own words, legitimate journalists.

I called DoTr and they told me they dont really invite media in such events because theyre livestreamed anyway, and that media who were present had asked for access days in advance. DoTr said they wouldve granted the complainant access had she done the same, but she didnt. Thus, the issue seems to have stemmed not from inequitable treatment, but from a simple case of a bruised ego.

What I witnessed is a trait prevalent not only among traditional journalists, but also among social media players  the desperate need for validation.

Regardless of medium, legitimate journalists should let their work speak for itself. A legitimate journalist does not demand respect. Instead, he pours his heart, mind, and soul in every piece he writes, then silently wait for his audience to recognize and acknowledge his brilliance. Legitimate journalists dont go around town with a megaphone screaming how legitimate they are.

As Harvey Specter from Suits once said, Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself.

Journalists, I admit, are humans too. But then, those who aspire to make it into the Big League should see to it that their public statements should be like, borrowing the words of Arthur Miller, a nation talking to itself.

And no, I am not Gods Gift to Journalism. I am nowhere near that and I myself am guilty of having committed more than a few glaring mistakes. After observing mass media for several years as a regular citizen, however, I cannot help but feel great frustration over the work of many Filipino journalists today.

Social media personalities entered the limelight because they filled the vacuum that many traditional journalists left behind, a vacuum that was created after years and years of churning out work thats unresponsive to modern societys needs and tastes.

With that said, I strongly encourage traditional media to reclaim its dominance over Public Discourse, but this should be done not by pulling down newcomers, but by producing content that makes the Filipinos realize, by themselves, that what theyre reading is worth every second spent.

I didnt start this column to prolong the war between traditional media and social media. Instead, I started this to remind everyone out there, including myself, that journalism is about helping the Common Tao make the best possible decisions for his future. And that is possible only if we end this squabble and instead channel our energies towards building this nation that we all love.

Instead of making ourselves the story, lets focus on issues that are truly of national significance, in a way that the Common Tao will more readily and more willingly understand.",RJ Nieto,09/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-what-exactly-is-legitimate.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Speaker Cayetano's ""Dolphy Situation"": a super typhoon's brewing in the House?","The entire thing started with the bloody speakership race involving Marinduques Lord Allan Velasco, Leytes Martin Romualdez, and Taguigs Alan Peter Cayetano. For two straight months, media bombarded the public ad nauseam with blow-by-blow reports, as if nothing else matters to the Common Tao.

Taguig 1st District Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano emerged victorious, but not without great cost.

How much political capital does he have left, and is it enough for him to survive for 15 months?

In the interest of full disclosure, I was briefly a consultant for the Department of Foreign Affairs from July to October 2017, then under Sec. Alan Peter Cayetano. I initially intended to be a 1-peso consultant but DFA officials said I should receive at least the P12,000 monthly minimum rate, which I decided not to collect after I amicably left the agency.

Despite this, I am convinced that Public Interest requires me to proceed with writing this article.

Besides, no less than President Duterte himself in his July 2019 State of the Nation Address encouraged every Filipino citizen to criticize the government when he said:
You are free to investigate. I don't take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.""
And in line with the president's statement, lets get it on.

Cayetanos precarious hold on power
As far as I can see, Cayetanos current situation is reminiscent of a line from the comedy legend Dolphy.

Asked about his reluctance to enter Politics, Dolphy said:
Doon nga ako natatakot, kasi baka manalo ako (Thats what Im afraid of, because I might win).
The context within which Dolphy said these words is his fear of neglecting his duties as a public official: he really needs to serve the country if he enters into public office, and hed rather not run at all if he cant do that. The offer to run came at a time when it was starting to be fashionable for showbiz celebrities to venture into politics, an offer that Dolphy gracefully declined.

Fair enough.

Cayetanos context, however, is a little different. That is, after winning the Speakership on 22 July 2019, will Cayetano be a House Speaker through and through or just a speaker only in name? And more importantly, for how long?

Unlike the Presidency where the winner becomes the de facto god of the Executive Branch, the Speaker of the House is generally considered as primus inter pares, meaning first among equals. Unlike the president who can be removed only through impeachment, the House Speaker may be removed through a much simpler process of nominal voting within the chamber.

House of Representatives Rule XV Sec.116 extensively defines the process of nominal voting but in a nutshell, the House Speakership may be declared vacant if 154 (thats 50% + 1) of all 306 congressmen vote in favor of such.

For how long will Cayetano be able to prevent 154 from being bold enough to defy him on this level?

That, I believe, is the most interesting question in Batasang Pambansa today.

Scratch that. Regardless of political color, it's the most interesting Philippine political power struggle question right now.

The Cayetano-Velasco Term-sharing Agreement
A term-sharing agreement between Cayetano and Velasco supposedly exists, where Cayetano is Speaker for the first 15 months then Velasco takes over the remaining 21.

In my best recollection, this arrangement is a first for the House. There may be similar setups in the past but none of them were publicized at all, suggesting that this compromise is so necessary that Cayetano had to publicly admit it in an apparent attempt to assuage disgruntled Velasco allies.

Cayetano, while undoubtedly the most popular politician in his native Taguig City, lacks the same degree of support from his peers in the House. In late June, four major House blocs  PDP-Laban, the Party-list Bloc, NPC, and the Northern Luzon Alliance (NLA)  issued a Multi-party Manifesto of Support for Velascos speakership bid.

PDP-Laban executive vice president and Pampanga 3rd District Rep. Aurelio Gonzales said without naming specific congressmen that partymate Velasco at the time enjoyed the backing of at least 60 from PDP-Laban, 45 from the Party-list Bloc, 20 from NLA, 15 from Nacionalista, 12 from the Liberal Party, and 25 Independents.

That is, at least 177 of the 306 House members want Velasco and not Cayetano, and thats over 50% of the House today... at least according to the largest House bloc PDP-Laban.

Meanwhile, Romualdez-leaning representatives led by Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Michael Defensor claimed 167 congressmen from various parties supported Romualdezs bid.

Both numbers are likely bloated, but one thing is crystal clear:
Not a single congressman publicly came forward to claim that Cayetano enjoyed any significant support from any major congressional power bloc.
I scoured news reports from the day after the elections up to ""SONA Day"" on 22 July 19 and I also asked a large number of my contacts from both the Senate and House of Representatives and none suggested that any significant number House members wanted Cayetano to win.

And as we all know, a political bloodbath ensued.

Cayetano vs the Duterte Kids
In late May, Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte said Cayetano came to her with a veiled threat, that if [she] endorses Rep. Velasco for Speaker, [Cayetano] would break up [the pro-Duterte Coalition] and this, he said, will affect the Presidential Elections of 2022.

In June, Davao City representative Paolo Pulong Duterte threw shade at Cayetano as he said in Filipino:
To my fellow lawmakers, I am just a newcomer but I think that what happened today should serve as a guide for our choice for the next House Speaker Lets choose a leader with respect for others, especially women, may they be the spouses of political rivals
Rep. Dutertes statement after Cayetano accused rival Velascos wife as among those who machinated for a term-sharing agreement between the Cayetano and Velasco. Cayetano apparently wanted to be a speaker for a full three years but he was aware that the compromise agreement was necessary, in light of his lack of popular support in the House.

A Utilitarian Truce?
The two younger Dutertes met with the three speakership candidates in early July and successfully came out with what appears to be a truce.

But this is classic politics, as Balkanization within the pro-Duterte Coalition goes against the interests of any of the meetings attendees. The five had to strike a truce out of political necessity, even if its just for show.

Yes, the Duterte kids still seem to dislike Cayetano, a suspicion reinforced when Rep. Paolo Duterte threw not-so-subtle shade at Cayetano during the first session of Congress.

In his speakership nomination speech, Duterte said:
I nominate a leader who understands local and national governance, one who can bridge the different branches of government, one who can ably and fearlessly represent the House of Representatives and the Philippines in the international arena. Mister Speaker, I nominate the distinguished gentleman from the district
A long pause followed as the younger Duterte pretended to double-check the paper hes reading then winked at members on the floor, a cheeky gesture greeted by uncomfortable laughter within the session hall.

Eight-or-so awkward seconds later, he eventually nominated Cayetano, but not without clearly expressing through a brilliantly-timed silence his reluctance to do so.

See it for yourself by watching this video:


But Cayetano still made it, right?
Cayetano appear to have ruffled not only the feathers of the influential Duterte children, but also those of his peers in the house.

In an early July phone interview with ABS-CBN News, Buhay Party-list representative Lito Atienza said:
Thats what Congressman Cayetano has been bandying around, that he is supported by the cabinet and that in fact, the cabinet would react negatively against the president if [Cayetano] doesnt get his term-sharing idea.
This is an extremely loaded statement coming from Atienza, as the phrase the cabinet would react negatively against the president may be construed as the cabinet will do something against the presidents wishes if Cayetano doesnt become the speaker.

Atienza, according to the same report, also said Cayetano threatened the House with problems with the budget if he doesn't get his way.

Here's the video clip of that report:



Its unfortunate that ABS-CBN didnt ask follow up questions to clarify this loaded statement.

With that said, Atienza seems to have accused Cayetano and his alleged cohorts of blackmailing the House, with the term cabinet referring to a group composed of several cabinet members led by Finance Sec. Carlos Sonny Dominguez.

Dominguez has stringently denied Atienzas accusations. He told ABS-CBN that the cabinet consults with the House only in relation to the preparation of the proposed National Budget.

ABS-CBN didnt get Cayetanos side but the solon will obviously deny Atienzas claims, so lets just assume that he did deny them.

Who backed Cayetano?
Whats clear, however, is that Atienza accused Cayetano of threatening the House with the cabinet would react negatively against the president if he doesnt get his way, although its unclear whether the cabinet will actually go against the president or Cayetanos simply bluffing his way through.

Whichever the case, Atienza clearly accused Cayetano of threatening the House with massive governmental disarray.

While Cayetano is known to enjoy the staunch support of a wealthy mining magnate, I doubt that the businessman has enough clout to persuade congressmen to switch to Cayetanos side and I know of no Big Business interests that is backing Cayetanos bid.

Adding the fact that Cayetano enjoys negligible support from House members as explained in the previous section, logic dictates that Cayetanos only significantly powerful backer would be some people in the Duterte Cabinet.
A high-ranking opposition congressman, whose name shall be withheld after citing fear of retaliation, said President Duterte, just like his two politician-children Paolo and Inday Sara, really wanted Velasco. Some of his more influential secretaries, however, managed to override his wishes.

And it appears that the influence of Cayetanos group of backers from outside of Congress, whoever they are, was enough to snag the speakership.
Cayetanos first month in Batasan

House sources independently told this writer that Speaker Cayetano has so far made three major decisions in this first month as House Speaker, namely:
That Congressional consultants will not be given consultancy fees for July 2019,
That contracts of a large number of congressional employees will not be renewed, and,
That there will be a significan reduction of maintenance staff.
At first glance, these sound like relatively innocous administrative decisions but a closer look reveals that these may cause a major migraine for the newly-installed Cayetano.

Let's each of them in greater detail.

First: no consultancy fee payments for July
I spoke with a content writer who handles a veteran Visayas congressmans online assets (website, social media, etc.) for the past several years, for a measly sum of 16,000 monthly via a congressional consultancy contract.

Its already the second week of August so she wondered why her consultancy fees havent been credited to her bank account, and she expressed immense frustration because she has nothing to pay her monthly bills with.


Just yesterday, she found out that the House Leadership decided against paying out consultancy fees for July 2019, a claim that was independently corroborated by another senior House official.

Regardless of the justification behind this alleged move, it is plenty obvious that all House consultants wont be too happy about it.

Congressional consultants strongly influence the decisions of their congressman-principal. As explained in the previous sections, a large number of congressmen are already holding grudges against Cayetanos speakership, grudges that they so far choose to hold at bay. But will these congressmen still be able to hold back if theyre continuously egged on by their consultants, the same consultants that the Cayetano Leadership didnt pay in July?

Thats the 16,000-peso question.

Second: non-renewal of employment contracts
The House Leadership, sources say, will not be renewing the employment contracts of a large number of House employees and the first wave of non-renewals has already commenced.

Many of the affected House employees have continuously served the chamber for years, and the nature of congressmen being elective officials with term limits forces Congressmen to hire them only on a contractual basis, possible only with approval from the Speaker of the House.


2019 election results show there are at least 140 of the 306 congressmen are serving their second or third term, meaning at least 140 need congressmen need to renew their employees contracts.

How many of these 140-or-so solons were affected by this policy and how would those affected react to the reality that non-renewal means will lose their most experienced and most trusted workforce?

And yes, thats a rhetorical question.

Third: reduction of maintenance staff
The House Leadership, sources say, also intend on reducing the maintenance staff of the Batasang Pambansa complex, or those tasked with ensuring clean, orderly safe, and functional House facilities.

I find this odd because there are only 2 or so janitors per floor so HoR Maintenance is already grossly understaffed as it is. Considering that there are over 660 restrooms in the entire Batasang Pambansa Complex, I cannot imagine how a small workforce will be able to handle all the work.

A Southern Luzon congressman told me that corruption is the knee-jerk theory to explain this move, as Speaker Cayetanos opponents may argue that the Taguig congressman may be planning to replace retrenched maintenance staff with people from a friendly manpower agency but the South Luzon congressman said its unlikely.

There arent a lot of janitors to justify such a theory, he said. Instead, he said its not unlikely that the janitors will be replaced by ones loyal to the new House Leadership.

He said I should remember that janitors are like a walking CCTV system: they know who visits which congressman and at times, they get to overhear confidential conversations between powerful people as they, say, mop the floor.

A living, breathing CCTV
The South Luzon congressmans alternate theory makes quite some sense because publicly available evidence indicate that House employees are likely fond of Cayetanos predecessor Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

Arroyo was known to be very generous with employee remuneration. In September last year for example, then Speaker Arroyo gave every House employee a 35,000-peso bonus to get through taghirap months. This is on top of the 5,000-peso grocery allowance they received a month before.


And while Arroyo has never publicly expressed her preference for the new speaker, all her allies backed the candidacy of Martin Romualdez, so pretty much everyone believes she supported the Leyte legislator.

Who will be more fond of if I were a janitor in the House, my former employer with a proven history of generosity, or someone whose track record so far involves allegedly Draconian austerity measures?

Thats a rhetorical question.

The congressman said Arroyos political rivals may see the current maintenance staff as Arroyo and her allies CCTV, and its in her rivals interest to replace them with his own.

Who, again, was Arroyos staunchest critic not too long ago?

That, again, is a rhetorical question.

And how would congressmen who may have been benefitting from these janitorial eyes react to the decision to let these janitors go?

That, again, is a rhetorical question.

Let me summarize what was discussed so far
A vast majority of the members of the House of Representatives wanted either Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco or Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez to become House Speaker and Cayetano never publicly received significant support from any significant Congressional bloc.

Cayetano still managed prevail, allegedly through the backing of some powerful Duterte cabinet members who, in turn, were supposedly able to dissuade the President from publicly backing Velasco.


Cayetano eventually became speaker, albeit through a very reluctant majority vote. Most of the House, including those who reluctantly voted for Cayetano, still hold a grudge against the new speaker up to now, although many of them choose to keep their feelings private for fear of retaliation.

But ill feelings are like a poorly constructed dam that can burst with enough rainfall and some of the rainfall came in the form of heavy-handed policies that directly contradict the core political interests of these disenchanted lawmakers.

Exodus Chapter 1
Just last week, 12 PDP-Laban members moved to the National Unity Party (NUP) after citing internal conflict within the administration party, with Presidential son and Davao City Rep. Paolo Duterte leading the pack.

Thats a Statement with a capital S.

Inday Sara, the other presidential child, is a mayor and not a House member so she obviously cant do the same even if she wanted to.

But had she been one, would she?

Did the three new policies help catalyze the mass exodus? After all, a person with 999,999 pesos in his bank account still needs an extra peso to be called a millionaire: without that seemingly insignificant peso, he cannot be part of the club.

Note that NUP is still largely supportive of the administration, but its composition strongly suggests that it is not as heavily influenced by Malacaang as the administration PDP-Laban.

That is, the younger Duterte and the PDP Laban solons choice to join NUP may be reasonably interpreted as ""Hey Mr. President, we still support you but we don't like this speaker.""

Will these three new policies, and possible other policies that I have yet to be aware of, catalyze even more defections? Only time will tell.

But more importantly, will members of the House of Representatives be fine with the introduction of even more of the same policies, or will they stop the bleeding while they can?

The next several weeks will be very interesting, my little birds said.

I agree with the Southern Luzon solon: its fun to have walking and breathing CCTVs, really.

Dolphy's line perfectly sums up Cayetano's current situation.
Doon nga ako natatakot, kasi baka manalo ako (Thats what Im afraid of, because I might win).
Yes, Cayetano won the speakership, but given the circumstances under which he won, along with his alleged deeds so far, what being a ""Speaker Cayetano"" really mean?

I'm curious on whether the widespread social media ops will escalate further after this",RJ Nieto,08/15/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/08/speake-alan-peter-cayetano-paolo-duterte.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"ex-DFA Sec. del Rosario, China, the Fishermen, the Incident and Reed Bank's Oil","If I were in Albert del Rosario's shoes...


Its public knowledge that President Duterte himself admitted that itll be difficult to exploit oil and gas resources in the South China Sea because of ongoing territorial disputes, especially one between China and the Philippines. This is the same reason why Philex Petroleum a.k.a. PXP Energy, which holds exploration and drilling rights over Reed Bank (SC 72), repeatedly failed in its moves to establish operations in the area.

PXP Energys 2018 Audited Financial Statement said Sampaguita gas field in Reed Bank is estimated to contain 2.6 trillion cu. ft. in discovered reserves and up to 5.4 trillion cu. ft. of undiscovered reserves.

The January 2019 US Natural Gas industrial price is USD 5.04 dollars per thousand cu. ft.. Using this figure, the Sampaguita Gas Field contains around US$13.1 billion in discovered reserves and around US$ 27.2 billion in undiscovered reserves. Thats about Php 674 billion and Php 1.4 trillion, respectively (PHP:USD = 51.44:1).

PH-CHINA OIL EXPLORATION MOU: A WAY FORWARD
On 21 November 2018, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping in a historic move signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on joint exploration in the South China Sea, providing both parties a diplomatic way to move forward with mutually taking economic advantage of South China Seas idle petroleum resources.

Through the MoU, each party will form a Working Group that will negotiate and agree on technical and commercial arrangements that will apply in the relevant working area.

That is, each side will have teams that will set terms regarding who does what in the drilling and exploration process, who gets how much of the profits, and whom the end-products will be sold to.


China authorized its state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) as the Chinese enterprise for each China-side working group, while the Philippines will authorize firms with active services contracts for a given area or, if theres none, the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company.

MoUs are essentially just agreements to agree, i.e. it is a very preliminary phase of any prospective oil and gas project in the South China Sea. However, the MoU states that China and the Philippines will strive to finalize cooperation agreements within 12 months of the MoU, i.e. by November 2019.

PXP ENERGY AND DENNIS UY
On 04 December 2018 and given the MoU, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi told PXP Energy that it can start applying for the lifting of the ban on oil and gas exploration in Reed Bank, which DOE declared in 2014 amidst escalating tensions in the South China Sea.

On 21 December 2018, PXP Energy announced that it has formally requested the Energy Department to lift the said ban.


On 27 December 2018, PXP Energy and Dennis Uys Dennison Holdings Corporation disclosed that they will be sealing an oil and gas exploration deal over Reed Bank by March 2019. A separate news report said this is subject to CNOOCs approval and consent, presumably in accordance with the November 2018 PH-China MoU.

The MoU really is very welcome news for PXP Energy, known to perennially post losses and whose continued existence, judging from its financial reports, lies heavily on the hope that it can finally tap Reed Bank.

Additionally, PXP Energys prospective partnership with Dennis Uy provides the financially struggling company with much-needed liquidity plus a possibly more favorable relationship with Malacanang given Dennis Uys perceived closeness to the President and his men.

For PXP Energy, so far, so good.


HOPE DIMS FOR PXP ENERGY
Is China willing to work with PXP Energy and Dennison in Reed Bank? Lets see.

On 11 January 2019, Dennis Uys Phoenix Petroleum disclosed that DOE greenlighted its partnership with CNOOC to build a US$ 2 billion Liquefied Natural Gas import terminal in Batangas.

On 01 February 2019, Phoenixs Board seconded DOEs approval as it gave go-signal for the Phoenix-CNOOC Tanglawan joint venture.

China appears to be very much willing to work with Phoenix and by extension, Dennis Uy. Given that Uy is prospectively partnering with PXP over Reed Bank, its so far so good for PXP, until


On 28 February 2019, PXP chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan said PXP reached out to the Chinese CNOOC but its radio silence on their part.

China, while willing to work with Uy, is apparently unwilling to work with Pangilinan. It seems that Dutertes good relations with Beijing isnt enough to make China forget its experience with Pangilinan in 2012, when Beijing rejected Pangilinans 2012 oil and gas exploration proposal directed to CNOOC.

On 01 March 2019, Phoenix, CNOOC, and PNOC signed MoU for the Tanglawan LNG Plant.

On the same day, President Duterte threated to shut down Pangilinans PLDT for busy anti-graft hotline 8888. He also accused PLDT of owing the government Php 8 billion, along with a subtle threat when he said no President has ever asked for payment, an accusation that Pangilinan denied.

China seems to still dislike PXP Energy and to makes matters worse, Duterte seems to feel the same about its owner.

DENNIS UY DITCHES PXP ENERGY
Just when I thought PXP Energys relationship with China cant get any worse

On 13 March 2019, former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario accused China President Xi Jinping of Crimes Against Humanity at the International Criminal Court.

Del Rosario is a director of Hong Kong-based First Pacific, PXP Energy's parent company.


I cant imagine how China will take Del Rosarios brash moves lightly, and true enough, it was all downhill from there.

On 29 March 2019, PXP Energy disclosed that is has terminated its deal with Dennison Holdings, i.e. Dennis Uy is now out of the Reed Bank exploration project.

Dennison effectively jettisoned PXP energy from its future plans: is this merely a coincidence or a result of how China and Duterte view Pangilinan?

On 01 April 2019, PXP Energy share prices nose-dived by nearly 19%. This is the business day immediately succeeding the 29 March 2019 announcement of the PXP-Dennison split.


On 10 April 2019, PXP Energy disclosed its latest list of Top 100 Stockholders, which includes former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario.

On 15 April 2019, PXPs stocks plunged to Php 6.84 a share, down 44% from 29 March 2019s Php 12.28 [https://bloom.bg/2Lb1nLx].


Things are looking really bad for del Rosario's PXP energy.

IF CHINA LIKES DENNIS UY
Beijing apparently sees PXP Energy and Dennis Uy on the opposite sides of the Likeability Spectrum.

On 16 April 2019, Phoenix and PNOC execs visited CNOOCs LNG plant in China, which shall be used as a pattern for the Tanglawan LNG plant.

Phoenix Petroleum's Dennis Uy, CNOOC's Wu Zhengxing, and PNOC's Reuben Lista sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the Tanglawan LNG project.

As Pangilinan and PXP struggle, Uy appears to blossom.

On 08 May 2019, PXP Energy disclosed that it will take guidance from the Philippine Government in as far as its Reed Bank interests, and said it hopes that DoE lifts the ban on exploration soon.


Nothing new here, although PXPs stock prices relatively stabilized after the announcement.

On 27 May 2019, Dennis Uy said PXP Energy and his Dennison Holdings agreed to ditch their deal because of uncertainty of government-to-government transactions. PXP Energy in a PSE disclosure welcomed Uys statement and said PXP energy is at the moment focused on lifting the DoE ban on SC 72 and 75 to allow exploration activities to resume.

I think this is very telling.

Judging from these, it appears that  China is open to jointly explore and exploit with the Philippines the South China Sea for oil, but that she doesn't wanna do it with PXP Energy. 

We know that China like Dennis Uy and China dislikes PXP Energy. If theres uncertainty in government-to-government transactions, and the only major variables are China, PXP, and Uy, then which major variable is the likely cause of uncertainty?

The Cause of Uncertainty
Note that I have been using the phrase dislikes PXP Energy instead of dislikes Pangilinan. It is still unclear to me if China has beef with Pangilinan per se or with First Pacific in general, and I am inclined to believe its the latter given Del Rosarios overtures.

But to solely blame the uncertainty to PXP is unfair, especially since no less than Foreign Secretary Teddy Boy Locsin insisted drafting the joint exploration agreement. This is the same Locsin that, a highly placed government source says, is an Amboy who spends more time in New York than in the DFA headquarters on Roxas Boulevard.

The same source, whose identity will remain concealed for his safety, told this writer:
President Xi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent signals that we are moving towards joint exploration because it doesnt make sense to place everything on hold. Our own DoE has been saying that we need alternatives to Malampaya (Gas Facility), but remember that Sec. Locsin demanded that hell be the author of any joint exploration agreement.
Locsin has not been sufficiently subtle in his general dislike for China when he unilaterally revamped President Dutertes independent foreign policy from Friend to All, Enemy to None to the more angsty (and less eloquent) Friend to Friends, Enemy to Enemies, and Worse Enemies to False Friends., in an apparent swipe at China.

This is despite Malacaang repeated assertions that Dutertes pre-Locsin foreign policy stays.


Suffice it to say, aside from Chinas apparent dislike for PXP, the American-leaning Locsin seems to also be in the way.

THE JUNE 2019 REED BANK INCIDENT
The developments up to the end of May 2019 seem to imply that Reed Bank exploration is a no go for the foreseeable future as far as PXP Energy stockholder and First Pacific director Albert del Rosario is concerned.

Then suddenly

On 12 June 2019, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced a collision of two shipping vessels  one Chinese and another Filipino  in Reed Bank.

Then a day later

On 13 June 2019, Del Rosario in response to Lorenzana said the Philippines must now consider a multilateral approach on the South China Sea Issue, citing that China has absolutely no respect for the Rule of Law.

The Philippines under Duterte adopted a bilateral approach over the SCS dispute, i.e. Manila dialogues directly with Beijing with no other state actors involved.

The multilateral approach that del Rosario insists on means the inclusion of other states in talks, other states like those within the ASEAN and most likely, the United States.

It is common knowledge in government circles that Del Rosario leans heavily towards the United States

The US-educated Del Rosario is very intimately linked with the pro-Washington US-Philippine Society where PXPs Pangilinan also sits as co-chairman and where top US diplomat and George W. Bush-era State Secretary John Negroponte serves as president.

SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT DEL ROSARIOS LATEST
Del Rosario immediately blamed Beijing for the collision despite the fact that investigations have yet to commence, which is the total opposite what happened just a few years prior, when he was still DFA Secretary.

Del Rosarios reaction is in stark contrast with a similar incident in 2014, or when a Hong Kong-registered commercial ship collided with a Philippine fishing boat, killing a Filipino fisherman and leaving four others missing.

CULPRIT? The Hong Kong-registered, 195-meter MV Peach Mountain is suspected to have rammed a Philippine fishing boat on June 20 off the waters of Bolinao in Pangasinan. Survivors say their fishing boat is similar in size to the 13-meter vessel shown above. (via Inquirer)
Commenting on the incident, then President Benigno Aquino, whose Foreign Secretary at the time was del Rosario, said the government wasnt accusing any country of involvement until all evidence is in.

Does del Rosario have something to do with the incident?

I cannot help but wonder as succeeding events revealed major plot holes in the anti-China narratives of the political opposition, where del Rosario belongs.

FIRST, the 12 June 2019 Lorenzana statement was immediately followed by a media blitz that is still running as of this articles writing, with the general tone that share pretty much the same wavelength as Del Rosarios 13 June 2019 statements.

SECOND, the media blitz shortly later included anti-China statements from the Filipino fishing vessels captain, despite the ships cook later admitting that the captain was asleep when the incident happened.

THIRD, up to this day, none of the 22 affected fishermen have executed sworn affidavits and continued to grant media interviews. Apparently, none of del Rosarios allies, many of whom are lawyers, explained to the fishermen that the longer they wait to execute an affidavit, the easier it is to impeach their testimonies in court.

The list of inconsistencies in the Anti-china version of events goes on and on, suggesting that the prematurely anti-Beijing rhetoric, at the least, is staged.

DEL ROSARIO WITH HELP FROM LOCSIN
And apparently, with a bit of help from Locsin, whether Locsin is aware of it or not.

On 15 June 2019, the Chinese Embassy in Manila, in response to the incident, promised to handle this issue with the Philippines in a serious and responsible manner.

On 18 June 2019, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a very mildly worded statement extended its sympathy to the Filipino fishermen and followed up with an offer to jointly investigate the incident with its Philippine counterparts, an offer that Malacaang seriously considered.

China's calm and reconciliatory tone in both statements is a total departure from the harsh rhetoric it used during the Aquino Era, suggesting, at least at first glance, that China was also surprised by the June incident.

Shortly after Malacaang showed some inclination towards a joint China-Philippine investigation, Foreign Secretary Locsin categorically rejected Chinas offer.

On 18 June 2019, Locsin tweeted, There cannot be a joint investigation. First principle of justice: no one can be judge of his own case....

Locsins grandstanding is odd, if not utterly stupid.

Malacaang, or where Locsin takes orders from, already said its inclined to accept the Chinese offer of a joint investigation, and last time I checked, Locsin is NOT the President.

Moreover, the clause no one can be judge of his own case (Latin: Nemo judex in causa sua), is a legal principle which states that no person can judge a case in which he has an interest in.

While China indeed has an interest in the Reed Bank Incident, the Philippines does too. That principle applies to both China and Philippines so Locsin, wittingly or (more likely) unwittingly, suggested a third party should the investigate, which would turn a bilateral issue into a multilateral one.

Sounds familiar? Yes, because del Rosario used the same term a day after Lorenzanas announcement.

Malacaang immediate corrected Locsin a day later when

On 22 June 2019, Malacaang said it welcomes and accepts the offer of the Chinese Government to conduct a joint investigation

But seriously, what can we expect from a Foreign Secretary who conducts Foreign Policy over Twitter?

ANOTHER DEL ROSARIO PR STUNT
While Locsin was busy defying Duterte

On 21 June 2019, del Rosario engaged in yet another PR stunt when he attempted to enter Hong Kong and told the immigration counter that his purpose for visit is to attend a First Pacific board meeting.

Yes, he told China in China that he will be reporting to First Pacific in China, the same First Pacific that controls PXP Energy that China seems to deeply detest.

Del Rosario even (mis)used his courtesy diplomatic passport, suggesting that his HK tte--tte is official business of the Philippine Government. He was denied entry, of course.

A day later, DFA said its cancelling all courtesy diplomatic passports issued to former Foreign Secretaries and retired ambassadors, halting del Rosarios PR barrage.
Del Rosario on a final attempt at a Dick Cheney?

As Leiden University-educated International Relations scholar and Maastricht University lecturer Sass Sasot pointed out, it appears that former Foreign Sec. Albert del Rosario has been doing to the South China Sea what US VP Dick Cheney did to Iraq in 2003.

Former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney resigned from the oil giant shortly before he became the Vice-president of the United States. While keeping his business interests in Halliburton, he fiercely advocated for the US invasion of Iraq, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and armed personnel. Halliburton, as soon as the war ended, emerged the winner as it snagged billions of dollars worth of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, with the first US$489 million  for its subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root.

Del Rosario, meanwhile, resigned from First Pacific and because the Foreign Secretary. While keeping his interests in First Pacific subsidiary PXP Energy, del Rosario crafted the Aquino-era Philippine Foreign Policy, which heavily relies on the existence of the 1951 US-PH Mutually Defense Treaty

The only significant difference from that Cheney and this one is that Cheney has already succeeded in promoting a war, while del Rosario is apparently still trying his best: del Rosario seems to be desperately trying to start a war that will benefit his own business interests

Oil and gas for his pockets, at the expense of the Filipino People?

After Statement on Bikoy: Caloocan Bishop David either a hypocrite or a liar?,"Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David's statement denying complicity in the now-discredited Bikoy Videos show glaring inconsistencies, suggesting that the bishop is either a hypocrite or a liar... or is he something else?

Let's discuss.


In a statement dated 06 June 2019, Caloocan Bishop Fr. Virgilio David admitted that he met Peter Joemel ""Bikoy"" Advincula in early February of this year. David said Davao's Jesuit Fr. Albert Alejo, accompanied by Advincula, met with him briefly.

David wrote:
I expected only him but he came accompanied by a man whom he did not even properly introduce to me. Since I could spare less than an hour and was rushing to another appointment at 9am, I met them only for a little while, over coffee.""
David added:
""Perhaps conscious of the time constraint, Fr. Alejo told me very briefly that the mans life was in danger, that he was being pursued by a drug syndicate he used to work with, and that he needed sanctuary. He was a chubby bespectacled young man; he struck me also as a glib-talker.""
Glib means fluent but insincere.

David went on to explain that situations like those ""are not new"" to him, and that he the term ""drug syndicate"" raised a red flag. He then said he advised Alejo to ""seek help from people who might be in a better position"" to deal with Advincula's situation.

He said ""it was not until months later"" that David recognized the man in the videos as the Advincula that he met in February and went on to say:
""Perhaps if I had not been in such a rush, I would have followed my instincts and navely provided sanctuary to a SNAKE!""

A few things off about Bishop Davids statement
David said he felt insincerity on Advinculas part so he didnt take Alejos request seriously. But then, David also said the meeting was very brief, so is David saying that he can judge a persons character in just a span of, say, a few minutes?

I doubt that a self-professed Man of God would judge people that quickly.

Moreover, Fr. Alejo is a very high-profile priest. Hes the same guy who helped Edgar Matobato and Arturo Lascaas, the witnesses presented during the Senate Hearings on the War against Drugs. David knows about Alejo, yet he dismissed Alejos request just like that?


Just how many times has Alejo approached David for help with a whistleblower?

There are two possibilities:  rarely and  a lot.

 Suppose Alejo rarely approaches David
Given Alejos very high profile and the rarity of Alejos requests, David could not simply dismiss Alejos actions as insignificant. Even if David considers Advincula as insincere, he must have at least inquired through Alejo or other sources about whats going on. Surely, somebody of Davids education, experience, and stature must know how to deftly deal with such situations, especially if it could backfire on him, just like whats happening right now.
 Suppose Alejo approaches David a lot
If Alejo made approaching David a habit every time Alejo finds an alleged whistleblower, then David must already have a pretty good idea about Alejos ability in vetting people. David is a staunch critic of President Dutertes War on Drugs, so he must be familiar with Lascaas and Matobato, both of whom are generally believed to have enjoyed Alejos protection. 
Assuming that David believes finds Lascaas and Matobato credible (he never spoke against either), then what is the likelihood that David also found Advincula credible when Alejo introduced the latter? 
Now, even if David found Advinculas story incredulous when they met in February, did Alejos credibility in Davids eyes account for nothing? Even if Advincula seemed insincere, why did David simply dismiss Advinculas claims despite Alejos backing 
Surely, David must have at least exerted some effort in investigating the Alejo-Advincula situation, yet he himself said he didn't.
Both possibilities yield blatant contradictions, suggesting that David is lying.

Now, heres the more interesting part
David himself said he found Advinculas story incredulous, yet he did not speak about it when the Bikoy videos came out.

David in the same statement even wrote, It was not until months later, when the man who had appeared as the hooded Bikoy on videos in the social media, removed his hoodie and identified himself as Peter Joemel Advincula, that I recognized the chubby bespectacled glib-talking young man I had briefly met on February 9, 2019.

The first part of the Ang Totoong Narco List videos series came out during the first week of April 2019. David, given his tenacious opposition to Dutertes Drug War, must have found about it on that same week.

Despite this, I never heard David speak about the video, despite his incessant tirades against the administration on the days that followed.

Let me illustrate:
05 April 2019: Ang Totoong Narco List Episodes 1 and 2 have been been published.
17 April 2019: In an apparent swipe against the government, David encouraged Catholics to renounce evil in the May 2019 elections 
19 April 2019: David attacked the administrations senatorial slate as he asked Catholics if theyd vote for Jesus or Barabbas 
23 April 2019: David admonishes Catholics for allegedly blindly believing that Dutertes Drug War is for Law and Order. 
23 April 2019: In a forum, David decried the supposed age of disinformation, a rebuke of the dominance pro-administration personalities in social media.
24 May 2019: Advincula flip-flops and implicates the political opposition instead.
I attempted to search for any online content dated 06 April 2019 (the day after the first two Bikoy videos were released) to 13 May 2019 (election day, or when Bikoys story was falling apart), online content where David directly referenced to the videos.

I also searched for any drug war-related statements from the Bishop after Advincula flip-flopped (24 May 2019) and BEFORE Advincula implicated him (01 June 2019), and I found none.
I found none.

Bishop knew Advincula was lying, he saw Advincula spread his lies for week, yet he said nothing about it, despite the bishop's uncanny interest in supposedly revealing the truth about President Duterte's Drug war.

Did David, through his recent statement, admit to being a hypocrite?

Bishop Pablo Virgilio David: a hypocrite or a liar?
Suffice it to say, despite Bishops David knowledge that Advincula was blatantly lying, he never bothered to call out the lies that he knew were spreading quickly.

With these said, it appears that the bishop didnt mind the use of lies  of disinformation  to achieve a purpose. He didnt mind that people used the same disinformation that he was whining about during the April forum where he was a speaker.

Despite his supposed advocacy for truthfulness, Bishop David allowed Advinculas lies to spread like wildfire despite his full knowledge that he is in a prime position to stop it or what if we just save some time analyzing his statement by saying that his denying his complicity in the Bikoy Videos is a lie in itself?

Given these, either Bishop David is a hypocrite or hes just another barefaced liar like Advincula.

Bishop David, which of these two do you prefer? But if you prefer something else, please do let me know, because I really want to know.",RJ Nieto,06/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/06/caloocan-bishop-bikoy-hypocrite-liar.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"On Bulacan Int'l Aiport, Duterte Finance Secretary's personal interests against Common Good?","Massive congestion in NAIA during the August 2018 Xiamen Air Incident, where a plane skidded off the runway, causing the cancellations of numerous flights as NAIA effectively lone runway is blocked.
Instead of allowing a new world-class airport, why does Finance Sec. Sonny Dominguez insist on us using an ultra congested airport and another one that's a bajillion miles away? Are Sonny's personal interests getting in the way of his decision-making? Is Dominguez, like the terminated ICT Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, another poster boy for regulatory capture?

Let's talk about that in greater detail.

NAIA, the worst airport on Earth
You may not know that that Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL/NAIA) is the 32nd busiest airport on the planet, but you probably arent surprised. The airport handled over 45 million passengers in 2018, a six percent increase from the previous year.

This is a far cry from the United States Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta and Chinas Beijing Capital International Airport, each of which handled over 100 million passengers in the same period. However, the fact is that NAIA is already handling 10 million more than its designed capacity of just 35 million passengers annually.

Most airports in the world have two runways each, enabling them to handle two simultaneous landings or takeoffs. NAIA has two runways too. However, NAIA can handle only one landing or takeoff at any given time because the two runways run perpendicular to each other, making simultaneous landings or takeoffs too dangerous.
A Third Runway

Addressing this issue requires building a third runway.

There was a plan to build a third runway during the Aquino Administration but it was shelved in 2015 after it was found out that it requires building over part of Paranaques Merville Subdivision and the closing off of Moonwalk Access Road.

That is, building the third runway requires  evicting hundreds of residents that would pretty much take forever, and  removing a crucial artery of C-5 road that will certainly worsen the already apocalyptic traffic situation in the Metro.

Building a third NAIA runway requires bulldozing a sizeable chunk of the heavily populated Merville Subdivision and building over a major feeder road to C5.
In short, its basically infeasible to increase the number of flights that NAIA can handle. Regardless of how many terminals we build, the fact remains that the number of aircraft that land and take off from NAIA will remain pretty much the same, unless theres a way to more efficiently use the existing runways.

The NAIA Consortium
The Department of Transportation on 02 May 2019 approved the Ayala-led NAIA Consortiums offer to upgrade NAIA. The consortium promised to increase capacity to 65 million passengers yearly as it promises to expand NAIAs terminal complexes and increase hourly takeoff and landing movements up to 52 from the current 40, among others.

While laudable, this airport upgrade is just a band-aid solution.

These are the yearly growth rates of NAIAs passenger traffic according to Airport Council International:

NAIA exceeded its 35 million capacity in mid-2015.
As can be seen above, NAIA, currently designed to handle only 35 million passengers annually, has already been overcrowded since mid-2015.

Today, NAIA handles over 28% more passengers than it should.

With the modest assumption that NAIAs ridership will uniformly increase by 5% annually from hereon out, we can expect over 65 million passengers per year 7 years after 2018. That is, the band-aid solution that is the NAIA upgrade will be good enough only up to 2025.

Now, heres the tragically funny part.

NAIA Upgrade Timeline
The NAIA Upgrade will be done in two phases:
Phase One: improvements and expanding the terminals at the existing NAIA land area. This will increase capacity to 47 million passengers annually and will take two  years to build. 
Phase Two: construction of additional runway, taxiways, passenger terminals and associated support infrastructure. This will increase capacity to 65 million passengers annually and will take ten  years to build.
I honestly dont know how the Ayala-led consortium will manage to find land for the extra runway, but lets assume for now that theyll somehow succeed expropriating land in Merville Subdivision within the intended timeframe.

Now, the NAIA Consortium hopes to start the Swiss Challenge by mid-2019, which is basically a prettier to way to say the bidding process is still ongoing.
Assuming that the bidding process is magically completed by end of 2019 and construction starts immediately thereafter, it takes another twelve years to finish the the entire project.

That is, the entire NAIA Upgrade will end in 2031 at the earliest. That is passenger demand will exceed the 65 million target capacity midway through construction and by the time its completed in 2031 (at the earliest), NAIA would need to cater to around 85 million passengers.


That is, by the time upgrades are completed, NAIA will be handling 20 million passengers more than the new 65 million limit. Thats 31% over capacity.

The NAIA upgrade simply can't keep pace with demand. Yes, NAIA should be upgraded, but we also need a new airport to accommodate rising demand.
Yes, there may be times of economic recession in the future but I think I'd rather not entertain that thought for purposes of passenger traffic projections.

In short, the NAIA Upgrade is basically like using a flimsy band-aid to cover a stab wound.

Mathematics necessitates a second airport
No matter how we put it, the NAIA upgrade will not be enough to meet passenger demand as the overcapacity rate by the end of construction will be even worse than before (28% in 2018 vs 31% in 2031).

The math shown in the previous sections show that with the NAIA Upgrade and without a second airport, regular Filipinos can look forward to longer flight delays, more flight cancellations, higher ticket prices and worst, the revival of inter-island shipping a la SuperFerry.


Therell be too many passengers for such a relatively small airport, ergo not every Juan can fly. Imagine queuing up for a bus ride to the province on a Holy Wednesday, except that youll have to do it in an airport and not just only on Holy Wednesdays, but pretty much EVERY DAMN DAY OF THE YEAR.

Clark (CRK) is also an international airport but its simply too far away from Manila.

Fortunately, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) has a proposal for a Bulacan International Airport a.k.a. New Manila International Airport (NMIA). Bulacan shares borders with Metro Manila and the proposed site is less than an hour away from Valenzuela, Metro Manilas northernmost city.

The airport will also be built in phases but if construction starts this year, SMC said it can have an airport that can handle 35 million passengers up and running in just 3-4 years.

Thats an additional major international airport by 2024, seven years before the NAIA Consortium finishes its upgrade plan.

This is not to say that NAIA will close down. As a matter of fact, most major cities have at least two airports servicing them, such as:
New York: Newark (EWR), La Guardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy (JFK)
Tokyo: Haneda (HND) and Narita (NRT)
Bangkok: Don Mueang (DMK) and Suvarnabhumi (BKK)
Jakarta: Halim Perdanakusuma (HLP) and Soekarno-Hatta (CGK)
Taipei: Songshan (TSA) and Taoyuan (TPE)
Kuala Lumpur: KL International (KUL) and Sultan Abdul Aziz (SZB)
London: Heathrow (LHR), Gatwick (LGW) and four  others
Metro Manila and surrounding provinces offer more than enough current and future traffic to justify two airports.

Unfortunately, it appears that the NMIA proposal is under threat as some government officials seem to oppose it.

Sonny Dominguez vs Bulacan Airport (NMIA)
The Transportation Department started reviewing the SMC-financed Php 700-billion NMIA proposal in February 2017 and it granted SMC original proponent status in October of the same year. Had the procurement process proceeded as expected, a new airport should have started construction in mid- to late-2018.

Unfortunately, Finance Secretary Carlos Sonny Dominguez appears to have been hindering this effort.

Finance Secretary Carlos Sonny Dominguez
In an August 2018 interview, Socioeconomic Planning Sec. Ernesto Pernia said Whether [NMIA] will be approved within the year or early next year, the only one who can answer that in terms of certainty is the Department of Finance.

A month later, Dominguez questioned the Bulacan Airport proposal.


Dominguez denied causing NMIAs delay, but his actions suggest otherwise.

In particular, he raised the following issues:

NMIA may depress real estate values in New Clark City.
NMIA may cause traffic congestion in North Luzon Expressway (NLEX)
NMIA may require realignment of Manila-Clark Railway
NMIAs proponent may have questionable financial capabilities

Dominguez is being really weird
FIRST, the government is NOT a real estate company, so I do not understand why Dominguez is worried about real estate values in Clark.

SECOND, the solution to potential traffic congestion in NLEX is road widening, not blocking NMIA which, as was shown in earlier sections, is a critical transportation infrastructure.

THIRD, I dont know why railway realignment is an issue for Dominguez because NMIA can simply connect its airport rail link to the nearest railway station, which is whats done in many major airports worldwide, such as:

New York JFK: JFK Airtrain connects to NYC Subway via Howard Beach and Jamaica Stations (see below)
Singapore Changi: A spur line connects to SMRTs Tanah Merah Station (see below)

Bangkok Suvarnabhumi: Bangkok Airport Rail link, a short 6-station line, connects to Phayathai MRT Station in downtown Bangkok. (see below)



In fact, SMC even plans to create a 200-kilometer elevated rail system that will connect the NMIA to EDSA, Metro Manilas main traffic artery, enabling travelers from EDSA to arrive at the airport in just 20 minutes.

Kinda like the Hong Kong Airport Express, but elevated and much longer.

FOURTH, SMC is third largest conglomerate in the Philippines according to the 2018 Forbes 2000 list, next only to SM Investments and BDO Unibank. Moreover, SMC will be in partnership with Incheon International Airport in developing and maintaining NMIA.

Assuming Dominguez is still doubtful of SMCs financial solvency, then why doesnt he allow the Swiss Challenge to proceed and see if the challenger has better financial capacity for a similar undertaking?


SMC has been given original proponent status in late 2017 so the Swiss Challenge shouldve been over by 2018 but it still isnt because, well, DOMINGUEZ.

Why does Dominguez seem so hell-bent at preventing NMIA?

Dominguez: The New Salalima?
I remember those times in early 2017 when I heavily criticized then Information and Communications Technology Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, the chief legal counsel and senior adviser of Globe Telecom until his cabinet appointment on 30 June 2016, for being the poster boy for regulatory capture.

Former DICT Sec. Salalima, whom Duterte asked to resign
Regulatory capture, or where the regulated becomes the regulator, is a form of government failure which occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.

In Salalimas case, what we saw was a telecoms regulator whose entire career prior to his appointment suggests deep loyalty to telecoms firm Globe.


President Duterte eventually fired him in late 2017 because, in the Presidents own words, many complained to me that he appeared to be partial because he's a former vice president of Globe.

Dominguez situation may not be very different from Salalimas.

Dominguez and the Zobel de Ayalas
Early in his career, Dominguez joined the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) until he became the President of BPI Agricultural Development Bank, known today as BPI Direct Savings Bank after a name change in 1990.

Finance Sec. Sonny Dominguez
BPI and its subsidiaries are majority-owned and -controlled by Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, who currently sits as Chairman of the Board.

Dominguez left BPI and Zobel de Ayala when former President Corazon Aquino made him Enviroment Secretary in 1986, but the two still share strong a business relationship up until Dominguez 2016 appointment as PRRDs Finance Secretary.


Dominguez family owns conglomerate Alcantara Group of Davao City. The Alcantara Group, in turn, owns Alsons Consolidated where Dominguez was a director, leaving just days before he took over the Department of Finance in 2016.

Alsons has an existing multi-billion peso joint venture (JV) real estate project with Jaime Augustos Ayala Land called Aviana Development Corp. Incorporated in 2013, Aviana is developing an approximately 27-hectare waterfront property in Lanang, Davao City.

An artist's depiction of Davao City's Azuela Cove, a joint venture between Dominguez's family corporation and Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala's Ayala Land. It is still under construction.
In short, Dominguezs family has a multi-billion-peso business relationship with Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala.

Why is this relevant?
The NAIA Consortium is Ayala Corporations brainchild, the same Ayala who ""coincidentally"" happens to be the premier business partner of Dominguez Family and a sister company of the bank where Dominguez spent his young professional life.

New Manila International Airport in Bulacan, on the other hand, is by San Miguel Corporation and a Korean Company: Ayala has no stake in the project.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since 2014, NMIA developer San Miguel Corporations largest shareholder is Iigo Zobel, relative of Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala. These two Ayalas, says sources and to put it lightly, are not the same. Iigo inherited his fortune from father Enrique Zobel who in 1983 was estranged from the Zobel de Ayalas main branch where Jaime Augusto belongs. That is, Iigos businesses are separate and oftentimes in competition with Jaime Augustos Ayala Corp.
Now, some may see NMIA as a threat to the profitability of the Php 350-billion NAIA upgrade project, especially since NMIA, upon total completion, will be able to handle 100 million passengers yearly, potentially turning it into the country's premier aviation hub and NAIA into a secondary airport.

But from the point of view of an average Filipino, I do not care which is which, as long as we have aviation infrastructure than can meet the public demand, and that is what we can't have if we won't build a new airport.

What we have here is a Finance Secretary who has the final say on the NMIA proposal, despite his strong personal links to NMIAs competitor. Instead of inhibiting from the issue out of delicadeza, Dominguez further complicated matters as he openly spoke against NMIA despite his familys business interests with the Ayala Corporation.

And by the way, Dominguez efforts toward protecting real estate values in New Clark City may benefit not only the new metropolis, but also the suburbs surrounding it.

Ayala Land also has multiple suburban housing projects that can cater to prospective workes of New Clark City.
And guess what? Ayala Landss Avida Northdale, Montala Alviera, Marquee Residences, BellaVita, and Avida Settings Alviera, are all situated in New Clarks surrounding cities and municipalities.

Are Dominguezs clashing interests a mere coincidence or a case of regulatory capture?

By the way, the Dominguez-led Department of Finance recent attacks against NMIA's developer over power and energy contracts doesn't help Dominguez's cause, as the Alcantara Group owned by Dominguez's family, also has interests in the energy sector.

TPs Lowdown
While I do not possess the power to read minds, I cant help but suspect that Dominguez decisions, in light of his conflicts of interest, may not be in the best interest of the Filipino Public.

Dominguez and the Ayalas are billionaires who probably can afford flying in their own private jets at their most convenient time, but regular people like you and I fly commercial.

Only billionaires, Heads of State, and rappers and like Drake can afford private planes. All other humans fly commercial.
Like you, I have to suffer through the aviation hell that is the Ninoy Aquino International Airport every time I fly, the same NAIA that looks less like an airport and more like a can of sardines as each day goes by.

Unfortunately, it appears that our own Finance Secretarys interests do not coincide with those of the General Public, who wants nothing but a more humane commuting experience.

I do not care who builds a new airport as long as one is built. But if Dominguez keeps on blocking the construction of the new airport and insists that everyone use a congested NAIA or the Clark Airport thats light years away from the capital, then what we have in Dominguez is not a public servant, but a government official who, just like Secretary Salalima, must be fired.",RJ Nieto,06/05/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/06/bulacan-aiport-duterte-dominguez-bajillion.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Hey Karen Davila, here's my reply to your complaint","Dear Karen Davila,

My manager spoke to me recently and he relayed to me what you had to say. It's funny that this is the second time you've tried to reach me through channels, even if you can very easily get hold of my phone number by calling our common friends.

Anyhow, here's what I've got to say in return.

Your latest complaint
The latest post you're complaining about is a blind item. You weren't named anywhere on that post, so why are you so affected? 

Note that I didn't cite the post here because I do not want to make that issue bigger than it should be, or for it to take on dimensions that I didn't intend it to take. I may be an asshole, but not 24-7.

Yes, the commenters tried to guess who that person is, but is it really ethical for me to suppress my followers' Freedom of Speech just because you didn't like what they say?

KAREN, U DAT?

Are you sure that Duterte is the dictator or is it some supposedly veteran journalist thats so onion-skinned, she wants to silence people who dont like her?

Going by your logic, should we blame you for the public ridicule that Alma Moreno and Manny Pacquiao had to suffer after they guested in your show?

Karen, please check the constitutionality of your requests before you blurt them out.

I personally think you have much to improve in your journalism, but I never crusaded for your involuntary silence.

Heck! I actually want you to talk even more because you, to put it lightly, amuse me every now and then. But contrary to what you would like to believe, I do not exist to torment you: it just so happens that you commit gaffes far more often than most high-profile journalists, and it would be hypocritical of me not to point them out.

Honestly, I haven't seen any other high-profile journalist commit the same kind of glaring mistakes that you do.

And why would I keep quiet about them? They are matters of Public Interest, and I am not indebted to you in any way, shape, or form.

A Code of Omerta
While it is true that there's supposedly an unwritten rule that journalists don't attack other journalists, I think that this rule doesn't apply to ""our"" case because:
First, you and your colleagues in traditional media don't consider us journalists but mere ""fake news purveyors"". Do you suddenly consider ""fake news purveyors"" as journalists when it's convenient for you?
Second, journalists should be able to take what they dish out. Are you telling me that you can't take criticism when criticizing people has been your job for decades? Have you never heard of Media Lens UK, Karen?
Third, you have talked about me unfavorably in your show several times, yet never have you respected my Right of Reply. Heck, you didnt even bother to ask my side on that episode about the October 2017 Fake News Senate Hearing, despite me being the topic of that specific episode.
Who was being unethical then, Karen? And you even have the gall to ask for fairness?

But that is not to mean that I exert no effort to be as fair as possible. 

As far as I can recall, I have never made up stuff about you. Everything Ive said about you were either based on publicly available footage or information that I have verified using at least two independent sources.

On your fake news about me
With that said, you told my manager that you were so hurt when I allegedly said Senator Trillanes bought you and your husband a pricey condominium unit. I find that funny because this was not the first time you brought that up.

About a year or so ago, you called a common friend to complain about that exact thing. I was with him when you were having the conversation.

Asked where you found that post, you said you saw it in ThinkingPinoy.info, which is not my site because I own as far as I can recall only ThinkingPinoy with the top-level domains .com, .net, .org, .com.ph, .net.ph, and .org.ph, specifically to prevent copycats from using my brand.
I specifically decided against purchasing rights over .info because any decent netizen will know that they usually are used by fake news sites so I do not wanna spend my money on protecting my brand from something that is unlikely to be a threat.

Do not blame me for your technological ignorance as your ignorance, technological or otherwise, is not my fault.


I vividly remember our common friend telling you that I never wrote that Trillanes-bought-you-a-condo issue because I do not own the source site you cited yet years later, you still insist that I did what I didnt.

Should I sue you for slander? But more importantly, why are you spreading fake news about me? Is that the kind of journalist that I should aspire to become, seriously? 

Am I really the one spreading fake news here, Karen? Should I call the CBCP so they can include you in their list?

Onion skin
You are arguably far more well-known than I am but I think that I have already suffered a sufficient amount of bashing, enough to have the right to tell you that public figures, especially those who willingly entered the limelight like you, should not be this onion-skinned.

When I was unfairly grilled on national TV by six senators for hours on end, have you ever seen me use the victim card? When Maria Ressa slandered me all over the world for god knows how many times already, have I ever cried for sympathy? When I was unjustly blamed during 2018 PH-Kuwait Diplomatic crisis for something that I didn't do, did I ever scream ""Woe is me!""?

No, I took all of them in stride. I let my followers decide whos the insecure liar.

Now, if you are still so convinced that I have unfairly and illegally maligned you, then please do yourself a favor: next time you complain, call me directly. 

But in case a multi-awarded journalist like you is too scared to talk to a huckster like me, please tell whoever common acquaintance youll call next the specific post and specific location concerning the specific thing youre complaining about.

Geez, Karen, the kind of complaining youve done so far smacks of bad journalism. A simple Who What When Where and How is an SOP: you dont just call random people and complain about something you cant even describe accurately.

Truth in journalism
You see, Karen, ThinkingPinoy started as a pedestrian putok-sa-buho who got so sick and tired of Mass Medias slanted reporting that he took it upon himself to call out the hypocrisy and the lies bombarding the masses every day.

Despite your visible dislike for our current president, be thankful that you work in the Philippines.

Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart, and even the much-ridiculed pundits of Fox News would have had a field day had you been working in the United States although that assumes you can, in one way or another, become famous enough to be within range of their radar.

And dont even get me started with the much more virulent European Press.

Karen, had you taken considerable and noticeable efforts to improve your journalism, I would have already forgotten all about you by now. But judging from your latest stunt with Vico Sotto, it appears that you really are the gift that keeps on giving.

When you so publicly expect so much from others like Manny Pacquiao and Alma Moreno, the public will also expect much from you.

I am part of that public.

Yes, I agree that I may not be as good as the person that I want you to become, but have you ever heard me complain to you about the flak I get from the public?

Despite all these
Despite everything Ive said so far, I actually am happy that you got to where you are right now. I know you have sacrificed a lot to achieve what youve achieved. I will not  and I have no plans to  take any of that from you. Your success is your success.

But getting to the top is easier than staying on top, and that second thing is the challenge youre facing today.

Will you stay on top by complaining to lesser humans like me, or by honing your craft and stopping the hypocrisy?

Think about it.

And no, I do not hate you: I just want you to be better.

I want you to be a better journalist not for your own sake, but for the sake of those who watch you every day. Filipinos have suffered long enough, so please dont make them suffer any further.

Legit Journalists don't act the way you do right now.

Note that I have been intentionally vague here because I tried my best to minimize any embarrassment that this may cause you. Yes, despite everything I've written, I was actually trying my best to hold back.

WILL ABS-CBN CLOSE DOWN OR NOT?,"There's a win-win solution, actually.

While at the wake of my mentor Jojo A. Robles, I had a conversation with a friend who happens to be a talent at ABS-CBN She told me she doesn't agree with me with my stance on ABS-CBN prospective closure.

I will conceal my friend's identity for her own protection. For purposes of discussion, I'll call her ""Sunset"".

My friend was actually referring to article ""Angel Locsin v. Jimmy Bondoc: THINK, ANGEL, THINK!"", where I basically grilled ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin for her poorly-informed rebuke of singer Jimmy Bondoc's earlier post.


BONDOC VS LOCSIN
Locsin was reacting to Bondoc's post where the latter said he's ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"" after describing the network as ""a snake pit, where success is based on politics and sexual favors.""

Jimmy didn't mention ABS-CBN, but I think we all know what he really meant.

Several camps have alleged that bullying, sexual harassment, and fraud are rampant in ABS-CBN, and I personally encourage victims to come forward and file complaints.

Gretchen Fullido blazed the trail, and she's finding much success right now after a Quezon City Court indicted news anchor Ces Drilon and a couple of other ABS-CBN network executives for the libel Gretchen Filed.


SUNSET'S POINT
Going back to what Sunset was saying, she said that while Jimmy may be justified in raising several important issues, Jimmy should have been more circumspect in the words that he used.

Sunset explained that Jimmy, instead of just expressing his disgust over the alleged crimes happening within the media firm, insulted thousands of innocent workers who work there.

I think I got her point, and I think her point is valid.

Jimmy seems to have adopted a scorched earth strategy when he wrote that statement: instead of simply criticizing the network's owners and the corrup person inside it, his use of the words ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"", while striking, may indeed be a tad too much.

Let me explain why.

THE FRANCHISE ISSUE
Just like Pres. Rody Duterte, I want the Lopezes to pay back the billions of pesos they owe the government, the same billions that may prevent the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise next year. And the government pressuring the Lopezes into paying back the loans need not, and likely will not, result to ABS-CBN's closure.
The fact of the matter, however, is that there are so many ways to deal with that issue without requiring ABS-CBN to close down:

FIRST: The Lopezes can simply pay the money back, similar to the what Mighty Corporation did a few years ago. The Lopezes owe the government is a lot less than what Mighty had to pay back so it should be easier to settle.

If that happens, then closure would be unnecessary. Otherwise, this leads us to...

SECOND: Should the Lopez Group lack the necessary liquidity to settle the debts in time, they can sell off assets to meet the requirement. The Lopez Group is worth billions of pesos' so while it's true that a few billion pesos will hurt its balance sheets, I doubt that it's enough to run the company into the ground.

If that happens, then closure would be unnecessary. Otherwise, this leads us to...


THIRD: In the assumption that they cannot (or unwilling to) pay, the government can just added pressure by not renewing its franchise.

If the Lopezes yield then finito. Otherwise...

FOURTH: I've heard from the grapevine that the Lopezes have managed to acquire an obscure TV station with an active franchise as a Plan B in case ABS-CBN doesn't get renewed. However, I have checked various TV franchises and I see that they contain a Non-Transferability Clause which, in simpler terms, means no part of a TV franchise can be tranferred to anyone.

Should ABS-CBN insist on using the said franchise to legalize its operations, Congress can simply cancel that other franchise as its well within its powers to do so.

FIFTH: Should the Lopezes play dirty by bringing the issue to the Supreme Court, I can so far see only two things happening...
A. The High Court respects the separation of powers, so that it will not interfere with Congress' decision to revove that obscure network's franchise, or, 
B. The High Court gives the case due course, then PRRD can in theory just play as dirty as ABS-CBN. After all, PRRD would have already appointed 11 out of the 15 SC Justices by end of 2019, a year before ABS-CBN's current franchise expires.
The Lopezes should be well aware of the fourth and fifth points so if I were them, I would just pay back what I owe to spare me the trouble. That is, whichever way things go, it seems that the Lopezes will eventually end up paying, and paying resolves the issue.

THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
The worst-case scenario that I can see is the Lopez Family selling all or part of its 55% stake at ABS-CBN to someone else, i.e. ABS-CBN continues operating albeit with a new set of owners.

Based on ABS-CBN's 2018 General Information Sheet, the Lopez Group owns around 55% of ABS-CBN, or about 481 million common shares. That's worth about Php 9 billion using today's ABS-CBN share price of P18.60.

As far as I know, ABS-CBN owes the government-owned Development Bank of the Philippines Php 1.67 billion. Adding possible surcharges and penalties, I think Php 9 billion is more than enough to pay the loans back. 

The Lopezes, should they lack sufficiently liquidity today, can just self half of their stake and they'll have enough. The Lopezes may also opt to sell their almost one billion preferred shares, worth over Php 18 billion. They even opt to sell a mixture of both commo and preferred stocks. Moreover, the Lopezes may also secure a bank loan to finance the debt repayment, thereby avoiding the need to lose any control over the firm. 

THE LOWDOWN
Whichever way, it is clear here that while the repayment of the DBP loan may hurt the Lopezes, it is extremely unlikely that ABS-CBN will close down just because of it. 

Thus, I think that it was unnecessary for Jimmy to go as far as expressing his excitement of ABS-CBN's supposed closure. While we couldn't care less about how rich (or less rich) the Lopezes will be, we should also think about how the lowly salaried employees will feel as soon as they hear news that the network is about to close shop, even if it it likely won't.

Like President Duterte, I am a very practical person: I'd rather have erring citizens pay stuff back than crush them because latter doesn't really do anyone any good.

The point here is this: Jimmy may have gone overboard when he raised the issue of closure. If I were him, I would've said ""I am excited to see one of the richest abusive oligarchs fall down"" instead. That way, he would not have caused undue worry among the thousands of less affluent employees of the station. 

I myself take extra care when posting statements so I can minimize collateral damage.

Truth be told, I think it's safe to say that most ABS-CBN employees don't care who owns ABS-CBN, as long as they have a job, such as the single mother that relies solely on her ABS-CBN job to feed her five kids. Meanwhile, the government is after the Lopezes for their unpaid debts and not the Lopezes' employees. 

Hence, it would've been so much better if Jimmy focused solely on the Lopezes and the Lopezes alone. After all, it's the Lopezes who didn't pay back the loans and not their lowly employees.

Jimmy should've used more precise verbiage, as opposed to one that attacked not only his intended targets, but also those who he wants to protect. 

As for Angel, I stand by my statement that if she insists on inserting herself into politically-charged issues, I highly suggest that she read up a bit first.",RJ Nieto,05/26/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/will-abs-cbn-close-down-or-not.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Angel Locsin v. Jimmy Bondoc: THINK, ANGEL, THINK!","Angel Locsin's retort to Jimmy Bondoc's post is disappointing, to say the least.

Background
Singer Jimmy Bondoc in a 22 May 2019 post said he's ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"".


Bondoc raised three core issues concerning the network:

Rigged contests that are ""manipulated to suit the whims of hidden bosses"" or whose winners are pre-determined,
News for sale, where the ""highest bidder gets the (favorable) slant"" and where ""foreign groups are usually the victors"",
""Countless victims"", ranging ""from sexual harrassment to plain and simple bullying""

ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin reacts
While he didn't name which network it is, I think we all know he's referring to the media giant ABS-CBN that's under threat of closure after its 25-year congressional franchise expire in 2020 because earlier this year, Pres. Duterte said he'll object to the renewal of its franchise as he accused the network of swindling public funds.

In retaliation to Bondoc, ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin said:

""The network might not be perfect but for you to be happy about thousands of people losing their jobs is pure evil.""



I find Locsin's reaction utterly amusing. I mean, did she just downplay criminal acts?

Locsin presumably read the entirety of Bondoc's post. While she admitted that the ""the network might not be perfect"", she never denied the widespread sexual harrassment, bullying, and criminal fraud that Bondoc accused the network of.


Did Locsin just dismiss these patently felonious practices as mere ""imperfections""?


Surely, sexual harassment, criminal fraud and bullying are issues that can never be justified because the networks creates ""thousands of jobs"", right?

First, Sexual harassment
Locsins words remind me of the Zamboanga del Norte Congressman Romeo Jalosjos.

As described in People v Jalosjos, Jalosjos in 1996 raped an 11-year-old girl in at least nine separate occasions, for which he was sentenced to decades of imprisonment.

The same Supreme Court decisions states that Jalosjos gave the girl an allowance every time he rapes her.

For example:
he asked her to fondle his penis while he caressed her breasts and inserted his finger into her vagina. After their shower, accused-appellant ate breakfast. He gave Rosilyn P5,000.00
Going by Locsins logic, Jalosjos might not be perfect but for us to be happy that the girl cant have a few thousand pesos every time shes raped is pure evil.

You are a woman, Miss Locsin, you should know better.

Miss Locsin, you didnt think that one through.

As for News for Sale and Bullying...

Angel never denied Bondocs accusation that the network slants news in favor of the highest bidder and just like Bondocs accusation of widespread sexual harassment in the firm.

Instead, Locsin very conveniently used the term imperfect to describe the network.
Aint that a little too easy, Miss Locsin? ABS-CBN News reaches millions of Filipinos on a daily basis. Did you, Miss Locsin, belittle the catastrophic effects of widespread disinformation just because ABS-CBN provides thousands of jobs?

And bullying, geez! Miss Locsin, no less than your father is a Person with Disability (PWD), and we all know that PWDs are very common victims of bullying. Thats why I was shocked to discover that you simply ignored Bondocs allegations of widespread bullying in ABS-CBN.


Have you nothing to say about the cases ABS-CBN anchor Gretchen Fullido filed against several network executives and Ces Orea-Drilon? A regional trial court has already indicted them on at least one of those cases, yet as far as I can recall, you said NOTHING about it.

Moreover, while I couldnt care less about whoever wins whatever ABS-CBN contest, I am just surprised to discover that you ignored Bondocs allegation that the network or its executives rig contests, as you yourself are a judge of the ABS-CBN'S Pilipinas Got Talent.


Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant.

But I'm not done yet.

On swindling public funds
Pres. Duterte accused ABS-CBN of swindling government funds. Angel, being a politically active aware individual after endorsing her nephew Neri Colmenares 2019 senatorial bid, should also be aware of this..


Citing massive unpaid loans from the government-owned Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Pres. Rody Duterte on 06 March 2019 said he will oppose attempts to renew the congressional franchise of Lopez-owned media giant ABS-CBN.

PRRD said:
""The franchise is up for renewal. You ask if I'll object? Yes, I will object! Unang-una, yung utang nila (sa DBP), tablahin natin yan?"" 
[TRANSLATION: The franchise is up for renewal. You ask if I'll object? Yes, I will object! First of all, their (DBP) loan, should we just forget about it?]
ABS-CBN's 25-year congressional franchise expires in 2020 and it needs to be renewed for the media giant to continue TV operations. TV franchises are given via Republic Acts passed by Congress... and PRRD, as the Chief Executive, has the option to veto Republic Acts.

Here's a partial list of unpaid DBP loans secured by the ABS-CBN owners Lopez Group:

1: Maynilad Water Services, Inc.: P710.86 million
Loan granted in 2001 and started to default in 2003. The Lopezes controlled maynilad until 2006. DMCI Homes and MVP's Metro Pacific Investments Corporation took over in 2007.


2: Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. (BayanTel): P591.81 million
Loan granted in 1995 and started to default in 2001. The Lopezes controlled Bayantel until Globe Telecom started to take over in 2012, with the government finally approving the takeover bid in 2015.


3: Central CATV Inc. (SKYcable)P207.10 million
Loan granted in 1997 and started to default in 2001. The Lopezes control Skycable a.k.a. Central CATV Inc up to this day.


4: Benpres Holdings Corporation (Lopez Group of Companies)P157. 95 million
Then called Benpres Holdings, DBP granted the loan in 1996. default started in 2002. The Lopez Group owns ABS-CBN, among Others.
The said DBP loans are over P1.67 billion in total.


Given these, did Locsin just say that we should overlook ABS-CBNs failure to pay P1.67 billion owed to the Filipino People just because ABS-CBN provides thousands of jobs?

Miss Locsin, you didnt think that one through.

Your nephew, the losing Otso Diretso senatoriable Neri Colmenares loves to paint himself as an anti-corruption advocate. By very publicly endorsing Colmenares, I can only surmise that you yourself are against corruption, right?

Now, how would you reconcile your anti-corruption stance with either your ignorance of matters that directly concern you or your giving a cold shoulder to what could be a monumental case of corruption?


Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant, so to give you the benefit of the doubt, lets just say you didnt think that one through.

Thousands of Jobs
Regardless of the points I raised in the previous sections, I cannot just ignore the fact that ABS-CBN does provide thousands of jobs of Filipinos.

My problem with your argument, however, is your apparent incognizance of the widespread and long-standing labor issues plaguing the network, specifically its Internal Job Market (IJM).


In 2010, ABS-CBN IJM Workers Union blasted the network for alleged unjust dismissals and worker harassment.

Union president Antonio Perez claimed that management had discriminately terminated, delayed, or rearranged work schedules of dozens of ABS-CBN IJM workers [ABS].

In a statement, the workers union said:
The management only offered regular status to selected workers, and it entails waiver of all complaints of the worker against the management, no back-pay or recognition of the delayed regular status supposed to be granted for those who served for long years already, among other conditions.
Lets cite another case, just for kicks.
In Fulache v ABS-CBN, where the Supreme Court said ABS-CBN forgot labor law and its realities and that it acted with patent bad faith in the case involving several retrenched cameramen, editors, and drivers, who accused the network of violating laws on regularization and engaging in unfair labor practices. 
The High Court ruled in favor of the unjustly terminated employees and ordered the network to pay damages.
Miss Locsin, you may have a distorted idea of the quality of the thousands of jobs that ABS-CBN offers, maybe because you only know of the rates paid to pretty frontline employees like you, but are you aware of the plight of those who work behind the camera?

Again, Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant, so to give you the benefit of the doubt, lets just say you didnt think that one through too.

Think, Miss Locsin, think... and only after then should you talk. Don't contribute to the misinformation. Please try to see beyond your nose.

The Bikoy Saga: Will Gretchen Ho dare to bite the American hand that fed her?,"Are Gretchen Ho and Hidilyn Diaz as innocent as innocent goes?
UPDATE 1: Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo on 10 May 2019 exculpated Hidilyn Diaz and Gretchen Ho from the supposed destabilization plot. Despite this development, the data provided in this article, along with the ensuing analysis, still stand.
UPDATE 2:  I wrote this article because my research showed that prior to the first update (see abov), I felt that I may still give Panelo and Andanar the benefit of the doubt. Panelo's latest announcement, however, made that unncessary. Given the colossal incompetence that PCOO and OPS displayed these past few days, I am seriously considering starting an online petition requesting President Duterte to fire key people in his Strategic Communications team. 
UPDATE 3: Online change.org petition ""PRRD, please fire your Strategic Communications people."" has been published. If you want to read or sign the petition, CLICK HERE.

In a Malacaang press briefing held earlier this week, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo showed to media a matrix containing names of personalities allegedly involved in a destabilization plot against the Philippine Government.

Among the names in the matrix were those of ABS-CBN anchor Gretchen Ho and Olympic weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz.

I admit that I was surprised to find their names on the matrices and I cannot help but be frustrated by the fact that the PCOO and OPS released so many names without providing any significant substantiation for the allegations.

But then, we already know that PCOOs Strategic Communications and Social Media teams have continuously demonstrated mind-numbing incompetence since President Duterte, so thats not news.

Senator Ping Lacsons 09 May 2019 tweet perfectly encapsulates my sentiments of that day:
Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz has brought honor to the country while journalist Gretchen Ho has carved out a name for herself in her field, both through discipline and hard work. Their inclusion in the matrix either involved excellent intelligence work or Bikoy had infiltrated NSA.


Whats news, however, is that thing about Diaz and that Ho.

Diaz and that Ho react to Panelo
In response to Panelos matrix, Gretchen Ho on 08 May 2019 tweeted:
So ano ba talaga?  Am I trying to OUST or SUPPORT the government?
Attached to her tweet were screenshots of the Panelos destabilization plot matrix and a photo with the president taken recently in Malacaang.



Miss Ho, let me remind you that the invitation only mentioned ""celebrities"" and nowhere was it stated that only ""pro-Duterte"" were invited.

Meanwhile, Hidilyn Diaz in an interview with ABS-CBN News said:
Sino si Rodel Jayme? Hahaha di ko po kilala. Lol nakakatawa naman
Given these, its safe to say that the overarching theme of their respective responses is that both women have nothing to do about anything even remotely associated with destabilizing the Duterte Administration.

Even I, at first, was inclined to agree, as Spox Panelo himself cannot explain why the two sportswomen were included in the matrix.

With that said, I decided to check if these two are as innocent as innocent goes.


First, lets check Hidilyn Diaz
Hidilyn Diaz is best known for winning a silver medal in weightlifting during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As far as I can recall, she rarely talks about politics as she mostly spends her time in training sessions and international competitions.

Earlier today, however, a Thinking Pinoy follower emailed me a photo of Hidilyn wearing a Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation (Yellow Boat) t-shirt which, I admit, roused my curiosity over Hidilyns potential involvement in the foundation.

Diaz (middle) wearing a Yellow Boat t-shirt. To her right and wearing jeans is Yellow Boat Founder Anton Lim.
According to a 25 August 2018 Yellow Boat blog post [Archived]:
Congratulations to our Hope Paddler, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz for winning the Philippines first gold in the 2018 Asian Games! We are very proud of your feat!
As it turns out, Hidilyn is part of Yellow Boat.




As extensively discussed in the 07 May 2019 ThinkingPinoy article NBI Cybercrime, you may have missed this BIGGER Bikoy-linked fake news website, Yellow Boat is linked to the fake news Facebook page Now You Know (NYK), one of the pages who helped the most in spreading the black propaganda video series Ang Totoong Narco List.



n that article, I showed that NYK shares a small office with Yellow Boat Foundation, with NYKs site administrator Jerry Mae Maghinay  who was also mentioned in Panelos Matrix  also working for Yellow Boat.

In short, Hidilyn is a part of an organization with credible links to alleged destabilizer social media organization NYK.

Hidilyn Diaz may be truthful in her not knowing who Rodel Jayme is, but she sure knows people who enabled the proliferation of a scurrilous libel against the State.

What we see here is that contrary to what is being painted in most media outlets today, Hidilyn is not totally unrelated to personalities who are strongly involved the Bikoy Videos.

However, as to whether she knowingly participated in any destabilization attempt, is still up to Panelo and Andanar to prove.

That's not my problem: that's PCOO's.

Second, lets check Gretchen Ho
Gretchen Ho rose to fame when she became a member of the Ateneo de Manila University varsity volleyball team and eventually, a host and reporter for ABS-CBN News.

Gretchen Ho is a known critic of the administration, but simply criticizing the Duterte Administration is not enough to show complicity in any significant destabilization attempt. I, for myself, criticize the Administration a lot, especially its incompetent officials in the PCOO.

A little background check on Gretchen, however, reveals a major conflict of interest.



In a 22 November 2018 instagram post, the United States Embassy in Manila announced:
TV host and #HappiNews Ambassador @gretchenho is traveling to the United States for the #IVLP Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists on Media Responsibility in an Age of Disinformation. #USPHexchanges70

US Embassy Manila's Instagram 22 November 2018 post announcing the grant awarded to Gretchen Ho.

The Edward R. Murrow Program
Given that the Presidents independent foreign policy clashes directly with US interests, the fact that the State Department funds the exchange program is a red flag in itself.

In an August 2018 Philippine Star report, President Duterte reiterated his accusation that the United States, particularly its Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is monitoring his mobile phone conversations, insinuating that the agency might plot to kill him.

But of course, assassinations are messy, so why not death by a thousand miniature cuts?

And with each cut being an anti-Duterte journalist who regularly spews an anti-Duterte content?

Now, according the United States Department of State website [Archived]:
Each year, the U.S. Department of State's Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists brings more than 100 emerging international journalists from around the world to examine journalistic practices in the United States. The Murrow program is an innovative public-private partnership between the Department of State, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, and several leading U.S. schools of journalism. The program usually occurs in October-November of each year.
What makes matters worse, however, is that the US State Department administers the program in partnership with the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which receives funding from CIA-linked and State Department-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

NEDs CIA links have been extensively discussed in the 29 April 2019 ThinkingPinoy article How much has Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, CMFR received from CIA offshoot?.

Let me state this simply:
Gretchen Ho benefitted from the same CIA-linked organization that funds Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler and CMFR.
To hammer the point home, let me quote the State Departments official description of the application process for the Edward Murrow Program:
""There is no application for the Edward R. Murrow Program. Participants are nominated and selected annually by the staff at U.S. Embassies around the world based on their journalistic accomplishments and potential to advance relationships between their country and the United States.
Judging from this, the United States sees Gretchen Ho as someone who can potentially advance relationships between [the Philippines] and the United States, which, as many would likely agree, is a more diplomatic way of saying Ho can advance US interest in the Philippines.

Duterte is at odds with the United States and theres no sign of Philippine Foreign Policy returning to its historically very pro-US stance but we all know that Philippine Foreign Policy may change when the Duterte administration is replaced.

Now let me ask the following questions:
In that light and as a journalist who likes to believe that she sways Public Opinion, what exactly can Gretchen do to advance US interests in the Philippines?
More specifically, what exactly does the United States expect Gretchen Ho to do after it gave her a prestigious scholarship grant?
Will Gretchen Ho ever support Dutertes Independent Foreign Policy despite the Americans expecting her to support American interests? 
Is Gretchen Ho willing to forsake any future US grants similar to the one she received last year?
Simply put, will Gretchen Ho even dare to bite the hand that fed her?
Surely, a supposedly legit journalist like Gretchen Ho must have made herself aware of the expectations associated with receiving US State Department grant.
What's the point of all these?
I am not saying that Gretchen Ho and Hidilyn Diaz have any significantly active participation in any destabilization plot. However, the findings in the previous sections show that these twos inclusion in the matrix may not have come totally out of left field.

I am in no way disapproving of foreign grants to Filipino citizens, but when the foreign power has CORE INTERESTS that directly clash with those of the Filipino People, then I have a problem with that.

Likewise, I am in no way disapproving of being part of charitable organizations, but when theres credible evidence showing that the charitable organization is heavily linked with a destabilizer, then I have a problem with that.

Suffice it to say, it is still up to the PCOO Sec. Martin Andanar and Presidential Spokesperson Sal Panel to fully substantiate their myriad claims during the fateful press briefing.

But to say that Hidilyn Diazs and Gretchen Hos inclusion in the matrix is totally unfounded, that the two are as pure as snow, is just like Esquire calling Maria Ressa the Sexiest Woman Alive in 2010.

Let me say this in plain Taglish:
Kahit ako man ay nagulat nang mapangalanan sina Diaz at Ho, pero takang-taka ako na ang portrayal sa kanila ng media ay tila wala silang kahit anong bahid ng koneksiyon sa kahit sinong involved sa matrix, samantalang malinaw na mayroon. Hindi ko sinasabing may kinalaman sila sa destabilization plot, pero hindi ko matanggap, batay sa publicly available data, na walang-wala silang kahit anong koneksiyon sa kahit kanino.",RJ Nieto,05/10/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/thebikoysaga-will-gretchen-ho-dare-to.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"NBI Cybercrime, you may have missed this BIGGER Bikoy-linked fake news website","NBI Cybercrime, you may have overlooked a website that could have caused even more damage than any of the five websites you mentioned in your Bikoy report.

And here I am to help.

Madam Claudia
What the FACT blog
In the 03 May 2019 Thinking Pinoy article Hey NBI, heres a new lead for your Bikoy Video investigation, a response to the Philippine Star article cited above, I earnestly attempted to help law enforcement by giving leads on some of these websites, with particular attention to the erstwhile totally anonymous Change Scamming blog.

The four-part Ang Totoong Narco List video series are more commonly known as the Bikoy Videos.

I thought it was over, until I stumbled upon another site which, judging from the dates of its posts and the engagement the posts garnered, may also qualify as a front runner like the five previously mentioned.

And I am referring to Now You Know, with Facebook handle @NowYouKnowPh.

As of 3:42 am of 07 May 2019, NowYouKnow (NYK) has over 667,000 likes and over 674,000 followers [Archived].

NowYouKnow has over THREE TIMES more followers than Pinoy Ako Blog (230,000), over FIVE TIMES more than Change Scamming (115,000), and over TWENTY TIMES more followers than What the Fact Blog (57,000). 

That is, in terms of potential propaganda damage caused, Now You Know dwarfs each of the these three websites mentioned in the NBI report.

To hammer the point home, here's the FaceBook page insights data taken at 08:10 AM 07 May 2019 of the pages listed in the PhilStar article (MetroBalita has already been unpublished) plus Now You Know:


Note that my page, Thinking Pinoy, is included by default because I used the Facebook Insights tool on that page. There's no option to remove it from the list.

As you can see, Now You Know's engagement is comparable to that of Pinoy Ako Blog, the strongest page among the five mentioned in the PhilStar article.
What did Now You know do?
Now You Know did not simply share the videos from the original youtube source. Instead, the page itself hosted each of the four Bikoy videos, garnering hundreds of thousands of views as of this articles writing.

Lets enumerate the instances.

For Ang Totoong Narco List Episode 1



Video Title: The ""true"" narco list?

Video Description:
A week ago, Now You Know did a story on ex-cop Eduardo Acierto's testimonies exposing the alleged involvement of certain Chinese Nationals in the illegal drug trade in the Philippines. Among them is the controversial former ""economic adviser"" of President Duterte, Michael Yang. Acierto also floated names of political personalities such as the former Special Assistant to the President Bong Go.

Today, NYK received another video presenting a testimony of a certain ""BIKOY"" (not his real name) who claims to be a former member of a big drug syndicate that operates in Southern Luzon and Visayas region. Bikoy presented in the video ""the true narcolist"" along with other documents that lead to big names behind certain illegal drug transactions.

Showing a series of evidences, Bikoy's camp claims that Presidential Son Paolo Duterte is one of the names behind such operations.

Video Title: 2nd part: The ""true"" narco list?

Video Description:
After exposing the alleged involvement of Presidential son Paolo Duterte in the illegal drug trade in the country as indicated in the TARA--an internal document used by the drug syndicate in their financial transactions--the second part of the expos reveals another name from the Duterte family.

In this video NYK received today, ""BIKOY"" (not his real name) reveals that Presidential daughter Kitty Duterte also ""gets a part"" in the illegal drug trade as she allegedly hides behind the name of Veronica Salvador.

Meanwhile, Paolo Duterte in his social media post on Tuesday responded and lashed out at a certain J.S., whom he tagged as being behind the video detailing his supposed connection to a drug syndicate.
Wow ha kung makaimbento ka wagas. Galit ka kay Waldo kasi binabara niya lahat ng smuggling mo ng bigas at asukal diba J.S.,"" wrote Duterte.

Who is Now You Know?
According to its About Page:
NOW YOU KNOW (NYK) is an online civic media platform managed by volunteers that delivers relevant news and information on the burning issues of the day.
According to the same page, NYK was founded on 15 November 2018 with the mission:
To be the among the country's top factual information online hubs that encourage more Filipinos to be involved in important conversations on issues that impact their lives.
According to the same page, NYKs email is nowyouknowph@gmail.com and its website is www.nowyouknow.ph.
I tried to visit nowyouknow.ph but its a dead link. Not content with such a result, I checked its WhoIs data.

The usual ICANN WhoIs search wont yield any significant data since NowYouKnow.ph uses a Philippine top-level domain (.ph).


Instead, the right way to do it is to go to Dot.Ph, the official domain name registry of the Philippines, and used its Dot.Phs internal WhoIs tool, and thats what I did.


Typing in nowyouknow.ph and hitting the search button, I got this:

Background checking the registration details
Though riddled with typographical errors, its clear that the registrants name is a certain Jerry Mae Maghinay from 2515 the linear Makati T2.

I checked for a social media profile under ""Jerry Mae Maghinay"" and I found this:


Now, it's possible that she's not the same Maghinay mentioned in the WhoIs records.

However, scrolling down her public timeline shows a 28 March 2019 post [Archived] as shown below:


Either this is the same Maghirang or its just one gigantic coincidence that I sincerely doubt.
Why is this relevant?
Well, a google search for Jerry Mae Maghinay [Archived] doesnt yield any significant results. A search for 2515 the linear Makati T2 [Archived], however, does yield some very interesting information.




More specifically, this writer discovered a volunteer organization database entry [Archived] about a certain project called YBH BANGKARUNUNGAN & SOLAR LAMPS TUNROVER (SITIO LIPATA CARAMOAN) with the following contact information:

YELLOW BOAT OF HOPE FOUNDATION
Mae A. Maghinay
09290761859
chief.hopepaddler@yellowboat.orgYellow Boat of Hope Foundation
In short, available data suggests that the Maghinay mentioned in the WhoIs data is the same as the Maghinay I found on Facebook. Here's one of the photos of herself that she shared publicly [Archived]:


The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation
Next thing I did was to background check Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation.

The said foundation described itself in its about page that partly reads:
The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation, formerly referred to as the The Philippine Funds for Little Kids, started as a national movement to help children who used to swim to school in the mangrove village of Layag-Layag, Brgy. Talon-Talon, Zamboanga City.
Zamboanga? This may partly explain the seeming typographical error in NowYouKnow.PH's WhoIs registry entry.

At the bottom of the page is the foundations address and contact information [Archived], and I quote:
Suite 2515, The Linear Makati Tower 2, Yakal cor.
Mayapis St. Makati City, PHILIPPINES, 1607
chief.hopepaddler@yellowboat.org
www.yellowboat.org

A deeper look at Yellow Boat
Heres what can be gleaned from the foundations website:
Yellow Boat is an Angat Buhay partner, according to its 13 April 2019 blog post [Archived] where it thanked Vice-president Leni Robredo. Angat Buhays flagship project [MB].
Meanwhile, the foundations two founders are Anton Mari H. Lim, DVM and Jay Michael O. Jaboneta, according to its Board and Management page [Archived].

Yellow Boat co-founders Anton Lim (left) and Jay Jaboneta (right).

Yellow Boat's founders are very interesting.

According to a 16 February 2011 post by The Asia Foundation [Archived], Yellow Boat co-founder Anton Mari H. Lim, DVM is on the board member of People Power Volunteers for Change  campaign supporters who have organized themselves to help President (Benigno) Aquinos administration.

During Pres. Benigno Aquinos incumbency, Lim was also a commissioner of the EDSA People Power Commission [PhilStar|Archived], a government agency tasked with institutionalizing the legacy of the EDSA People Power Revolution[EO 82 s.99]

During the Noynoy Aquino administration, Yellow Boat co-founder Anton Lim was a commissioner of the People Power Commission.

Meanwhile, the other co-founder Jay Michael Jaboneta in his personal website [Archived] describes himself as the first and former Director for New Media under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) and started the team that managed Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino IIIs official website and social networking presence.
Yellow Boat Foundation co-founder Jay Jaboneta in 2011 receives the ""Liberal Project Award"" from  the Friedrich Nauman Foundation, an affiliate of the Liberal Party of the Philippines. Handing the award is then Senator and LP President Franklin Drilon. Witnessing the event is then Transportation Secretary Emilio ""Jun"" Abaya.
The Yellow Boat Foundations founders are heavily linked with the Aquino Administration as both held appointive positions in pro-Aquino propaganda arms, namely the Aquino-era People Power Commission and the Aquino-era PCOO.


What just happened?
Before you get confused, lets consolidate what weve found out so far.

Judging from the timing of NowYouKnows five uploads related to the four-part Ang Totoong Narco List video series, along with the engagement each video received to date, I think the National Bureau of Investigation Cybercrime Division should also take a look at NowYouKnows potential complicity.

To help law enforcement with this prospective investigation, I checked for leads by tracing the ownership of NowYouKnows official website, NowYouKnow.ph.




The search led me to a registrant named Jerry Mae Maghinay with address at 2515 The Linear Makati T2, Makati City.

Now, publicly available data shows that NowYouKnow shares addresses with The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation, whose two founders Anton Lim and Jay Michael Jaboneta are not just Aquino supporters, but Aquino appointees.

Aside from the common address, is NowYouKnow totally unrelated to The Yellow Boat of Hope?

Apparently not, as publicly available data cited in the previous sections show that NowYouKnows registrant also works for The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation.

Now, it is interesting to note that The Linear Makati is a high-rise residential condominium complex whose biggest unit design is just 49 square meters, according to its developer's website.

Diagrams of units at The Linear Makati. Source: aspirebyfilinvest.com

This 49-sqm area is just 7x7 meters which, in my opinion, is pretty small to house two organizations, unless  the two organizations are basically one and the same or  they are significantly independent from each other but their respective management teams dont mind packing all their employees into such a tight space.

With that said, I think the NBI should ask a few questions to the people whose names were mentioned above because based on my years of experience as a social media practitioner, the damage that NowYouKnow caused on the credit of the state is no laughing matter.

We need to find an answer to this question:
Is the LP-linked Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation moonlighting as a black propaganda organization?
That's what I would personally like to know.",RJ Nieto,05/07/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/nbi-cybercrime-you-missed-this-bigger.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Hey NBI, heres a new lead for your Bikoy Video investigation","Hey NBI guys, I heard you're looking for other people, so let me humbly give you a few leads that you may have overlooked.
Note to Mr. Rodel Jayme: for your own sake, better spill the beans ASAP so you can still become a state witness.  Your would-be testimony may become unnecessary very soon.
Other websites of interest
According to a Philippine Star article, you noted in the complaint that the libelous and seditious Ang Totoong Narcolist video was posted by different social media sites, 'having the front runners to wit:'
Pinoy Ako Blog
Change Scamming
Metro Balita
Madam Claudia
What the FACT blog
Furthermore, you guys said, ""Continuous efforts were conducted to uncover personalities behind these accounts. Recently, crucial information on METRO BALITA were gathered. Hence, emphasis and focus were made.

From what I understand, you dealt with Metro Balita first because information about it was already on your hands, which suggests that you are still digging for information about the others.


A little housekeeping

Because I am a law-abiding citizen who wants to help the government enforce the law, let me give you guys a few leads in case you need them but lets deal with the preliminary stuff first.

First, I have no data so far about What the Fact blog so I cannot help you with that yet. Give me a little more time for that.


Second, you already know who's behind MetroBalita: Rodel Jayme, the guy you arrested recently.


Third, two of Pinoy Ako Blog's owners/operators are already known (Jover Laurio and Cocoy Dayao). There are at least two others, but Laurio and Dayao are already a good start.

Fourth, Madam Claudia used to run Google Ads under the AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134. In my 29 Sept 2017 #CocoyGate article ""#CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for"", I was able to connect the dots and show that it's very likely owned by Cocoy Dayao.

If you want to know how I traced these, see the following video:


So you have three names so far: Rodel Jayme, Cocoy Dayao, and Jover Laurio.


Now that were done with housekeeping, lets get to the more interesting part.

Who is behind Change Scamming?
As was shown in the 29 September 2017 ThinkingPinoy article #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for, Change Scamming used to run Google Ads under the AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134 (Check the #CocoyGate article in the previous paragraph).



From that same article, I also discovered, using a reverse Google AdSense Lookup, that ads linked to AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134 were served not only in ChangeScammings website, but also in at least ten other websites, namely:
AnuNaBes.com
DiKukurap.com
DotReport.org
DuterteAdminNews.com
FightForTruth.club
FixPH.org
PilipinongPalaban.com
PolitikangInaMo.com
SocialPatrol.ph
Kolektibo.com
Check the following video if you want to know how I did that:


As far as I know, a person can register under his name one AdSense account at the maximum, so Cocoy couldn't possibly own AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 if already owns ca-pub-8283971809912134.

Moreover, Cocoy has already admitted in the past that he owns ProPinoy.net, which already served under Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134. That is, Cocoy must own the account with that number, so that somebody else must own the account with Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996.

And that's what this article is about.

Domain Privacy Protection 101
While researching for that 2017 article, I checked the domain registration details of each of these 10 websites, only to discover that they all use a domain privacy protection service. Hence, I hit nothing but dead ends.

The said service is identical to the one I used for ThinkingPinoy.net so that I can avoid spam calls and emails if my contact details are out in the open for everyone to see. 

Here, look at the WhoIs Information of ThinkingPinoy.net with active Domain Privacy Protection:

As you can see, the registration details are those of my Domain Privacy Protection Service provider, instead of my own contact information.

Yes, domain privacy protection services mask the real name and contact information of website owners, but they are paid services that need to be renewed as soon as or preferably even before they expire, as neglecting to do so would reveal the true details of the websites owner.

On 03 May 2019, or two years after writing the article mentioned above, I re-checked if any of the domain privacy protection services of the ten websites linked to Change Scamming have expired.

And as it turns out, one of them did.

Expired Domain Privacy: Kolektibo.com
Domain Privacy Services for the first nine websites (from AnuNaBes.com down to SocialPatrol.Ph) have always been active. However, the one for Kolektibo.com lapsed, at least for a period long enough to reveal the sites true owner.

Suffice it to say, I checked for the WhoIs history of Kolektibo.com using the third-party online utility DomainTools.com. Here's what I did:



According to its WhoIs History, Kolektibo.com was first registered  with domain privacy protection  on 08 August 2017. Domain privacy protection was in effect for an entire year, until it lapsed on 19 September 2018.

On that exact day, Kolektibo.coms domain registration showed not the placeholder information typical of websites with domain privacy, but the actual name and contact details of the real person who owns the said website.

Let me quote part of the WhoIs record of Kolektibo.com, according to DomainTools:
Domain name: kolektibo.com
Domain name: kolektibo.com
Registrant Name: Sidney Zosa
Registrant Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center
Registrant City: Pasig City
Registrant Phone: +63.9151350194
Registrant Email: sidney.zosa@gmail.com 
Admin Name: Sidney Zosa
Admin Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center
Admin City: Pasig City

Tech Name: Sidney Zosa
Tech Organization:
Tech Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center
Tech Phone: +63.9151350194
Tech Email: sidney.zosa@gmail.com

What should be done to Sidney Zosa?
According to the websites WhoIs History as reported by DomainTools, a certain Sidney Zosa owns, administers, and maintains Kolektibo.com, a website that earned money by serving online advertisements under Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996.

Recall that Change Scamming, the website youre investigating, also served online advertisements using the same Google AdSense Publisher ID.

Now, heres an important (rhetorical) question:
If I were a website owner, would I let my sites ad earnings go to somebody else?
Sidney Zosa owns Kolektibo.com, so that money earned via Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 should go to him, unless he is just an employee or associate of someone higher up the food chain.



Google AdSense Terms of Service corroborate this observation, and agreement to these terms is a prerequisite for owning an AdSense account.

More specifically, part of the Philippine version of the Google AdSense Terms of Service states [AdSense]:
13. Mga Pagkakatawan; Mga Warantiya; Mga Pagtatanggi 
Kinakatawan mo at ginagarantiya na  ikaw ang may-ari ng, o legal na may pahintulot na kumilos sa ngalan ng may-ari ng ng bawat Ari-arian;  ikaw ang teknikal at pang-editoryal na nagpapasya kaugnay ng bawat Ari-arian kung saan ang Mga Serbisyo ay ipinatupad at mayroon kang kontrol sa paraan ng pagpapatupad ng Mga Serbisyo sa bawat Ari-Arian
Translating this to English
13. Representations; Warranties; Disclaimers 
You represent and warrant that  you are the owner of, or are legally authorized to act on behalf of the owner of, each Property;  you are the technical and editorial decision maker in relation to each Property on which the Services are implemented and you have control over the way in which the Services are implemented on each Property
Based on this document, either:
 Sidney Zosa owns the AdSense Account, or
 he legally authorized somebody else to administer his AdSense for him. 
A little logic
If Zosa owns the AdSense account, then he must also be the editorial decision maker of Change Scamming, as those AdSense Terms and Conditions applies to all properties (websites) in which Google Ads are served (i.e. Change Scamming). That is, if Zosa admits to owning the AdSense account, then hes the guy behind Change Scamming, the exact guy youre looking for.

Now, if he legally authorized somebody else to administer his AdSense, then he must tell you who it is if he doesnt want to be implicated in this scandal.

Now, suppose he gives you another name, then that other person would be the owner of Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 (pending verification with Googles officers, of course).

Again, by virtue of the same Google AdSense Terms of Service, that ""other person"" would be the technical and editorial decision maker in relation to Change Scamming.

Ask Zosa about who he has closely worked with in the past, most especially in tech-related projects.

For example, the website Lawhackers.co featured a technological startup called Supra and the writeup reads [Archived]:

Supra is a learning app for law students in the Phillipines, currently covering 38 volumes of the Civil Law Bar. It brings neat aesthetics and great navigation to create an amazing learning experience that is the first of its kind. 
Founders: Sidney Zosa and Mars Veloso 
Launched: 2014
Made in: Tacloban, Phillipines (sic)

Is the owner of the Google AdSense account behind Change Scamming Sidney Zosa, Mars Veloso, or somebody else?

With that said, I highly recommend that you guys contact Zosa and ask him a few questions.

Available evidence currently points to him, but please accord him due process.

You are not Rappler, after all.",RJ Nieto,05/03/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/rodel-jayme-nbi-bikoy-investigation.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Fact-checking the fact-checker: Over 50% of Vera Files funding from CIA-linked orgs,"Why don't we fact-check the fact-checker?

In a Facebook Newsroom post, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said [FB]:
Our partners are independent and certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network.
One of the core requirements to become a Facebook fact-checker is membership in the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of the Florida-based Poynter Institute for Media Studies.

In fairness to Lyons, she also acknowledged allegations of bias among the websites fact checkers when she, in the same newsroom post, said:
While we work with the International Fact-Checking Network to approve all our partners and make sure they have high standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency, we continue to face accusations of bias.
The social network currently has two fact-checkers in the Philippines: Rappler and Vera Files.

In this article, we will examine Vera Files.

IFCN Code of Principles: Nonpartisanship Policy
Poynter-IFCN has a Code of Principles that it describes as a series of commitments organizations abide by to promote excellence in fact-checking [IFCN].

Each IFCN member is required to adhere to this Code, determined through yearly assessments.

According to the IFCN website, Vera Files co-founder and UP Journalism professor Yvonne Chua submitted an application of behalf of her organization. This was assessed  and approved  by IFCN external assessor Jeremaiah M. Opiniano, a Journalism assistant professor at the University of Santo Tomas.
A screenshot of Vera Files' application sent to the Poynter Institute's International Fact-checking Network.
Opiniano assessed and approved Vera Files applications twice: once in 2017 and another time in 2018.

Part of the IFCN code of ethics is a nonpartisanship policy, which requires applicants to share evidence of your policy preventing staff from direct involvement in political parties and advocacy organizations.

In response, Vera Files in its 2017 application said (Criterion 2b):
We dont take money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

Vera Files reiterated this claim in its 2018 application (Criterion 2b), where it stated:
VERA Files prohibits its trustees and staff from taking money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups...
A screenshot of Vera Files' attestation of nonpartisanship in its 2018 IFCN application 
The problem, however, is that a closer look at its finances show that it may have been lying in both 2017 and 2018.

Lets discuss this in greater detail.

Vera Files Funding Sources
Section 4 of the IFCN Code of Principles application form, entitled Transparency of Funding & Organization, requires Vera Files to disclose funding sources.

To address this in its 2017 application, Vera Files submitted its 2016 SCHEDULE OF CONTRIBUTIONS/DONATIONS - PRIVATE ENTITIES that listed five sources of funding.

Vera Files' 2016 funding sources are as follows:
National Endowment for Democracy (NED): Php 2,539,050.00.
World Health Organization (WHO): Php 1,998,879.79
The Asia Foundation (TAF): Php2,101,401.00
Reporters Without Borders Germany (RWB): Php 736,299.58
Others: Php 1,001,891.10
A screenshot of the Funding Source Document Vera Files submitted to IFCN in 2017. 

In its 2018 application, Verafiles listed three sources for 2017 funding, namely:
National Endowment for Democracy: Php 4,034,313.00
World Health Organization: Php 1,683,150.00
Others: Php 1,132,892.29

A little arithmetic shows that Vera Files:
derived 54% of its 2016 private funding from NED and TAF
derived 59% of its 2017 private funding from NED alone.
Now, lets examine these two major funders.

Vera Files Funder #1: National Endowment for Democracy
NED, in its About page, describes itself as a private, nonprofit foundation dedicated to the growth and strengthening of democratic institutions around the world [NED].

The description sounds innocuous enough.

However, in his 2008 piece entitled NED et. al.: The CIAs Successors and Collaborators, published in both the Canadian Centre for Global Research and Globalization (Global Research) and the French Le Monde Diplomatique, Hernando Calvo Ospina wrote [GlobalResearch]:
When a scandal in the 1980s revealed the CIAs 35 years of international manipulations, President Ronald Reagan established the National Endowment for Democracy as a more discreet and less controversial instrument. It had the same purpose  to destabilise unfriendly governments by funding the opposition... Although legally an NGO, the NED was funded from the State Department budget, subject to congressional approval
But thats coming from a NED critics, so lets cite the statement of NED people themselves.
In a 1991 interview with the Washington Post, NED founder and theoretical planner Allen Weinstein said [WaPo]:
A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.
Weinsteins statement basically means NED is an offshoot of the US Central Intelligence Agency.


The NED of today affirms this, as the History section of its About page states [NED]:
In the aftermath of World War II. U.S. policy makers resorted to covert means, secretly sending advisers, equipment, and funds to support newspapers and parties under siege in Europe. When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly.
That is, NED does today what the CIA did beforehand.

According to NED's Awarded Grants Database, NED's grants to Vera Files are specifically intended for the latter's fact-checking operations [NED | Archived]:

A Screenshot of NED's list of grants to Vera Files.

Vera Files Funder #2: The Asia Foundation
According to its own website, the Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia [AF].

Like NED, the description sounds sufficiently harmless.

A 1977 New York Times article Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A. detailing Asia Foundations beginnings, however, suggests otherwise, as it states [NYT]:
The Asia Foundation was headed for years by the late Robert Blum who, several sources said, resigned from the C.I.A. to take it over. The foundation provided cover for at least one C.I.A. operative and carried out a variety of mediarelated ventures, including a program, begun in 1955, of selecting and paying the expenses of Asian journalists for a year of study in Harvard's prestigious Neiman Fellowship program.
Side Note: The managing editor of Rappler (the other Facebook fact-checker in the Philippines), Glenda Gloria, is a 2018 Neiman Fellow [Rappler], and NED also funds Rappler.
A screenshot of the 1977 New York Times article Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A. detailing Asia Foundations beginnings.
A more informative description can be found in the declassified 2000 CIA document that states [CIA]:
The Asia Foundation was originally a creation of the Executive Branch intended to promote U.S. Foreign Policy Interests in the region
A screenshot of the declassified 2000 CIA document describing The Asia Foundation.

The same CIA document states that in 1975:
 the State Department appointed a panel of private citizens with Foreign Affairs experience to review the foundations record and potential for assisting in the achievement of U.S. objectives in Asia. The panel concluded that the foundation is an effective instrument for furthering of United States interests in Asia
A screenshot of the declassified 2000 CIA document describing The Asia Foundation.
In his 2011 paper published in the Journal of Anthropological Research [ResearchGate], Washington-based Saint Martin University Sociology and Anthropology professor Dr. David Price aptly cited Asia foundation as a CIA funding front.

Fact-checking the Fact-checker
Recall that Vera Files claimed in its 2018 IFCN application that it prohibits its trustees and staff from taking money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

Vera Files reiterated this claim in its own FAQ article What you want to know about VERA FILES FACT CHECK as Vera Files' response to the question:
How sure are we that youre not backed by a politician or political party?
But arent the National Endowment for Democracy and the Asia Foundation, both of whom are widely considered as instruments of U.S. Foreign Policy, political parties? 

Both sure are parties, and their respective histories shows they are very political.

The Collins Dictionary defines ""political party"" as ""an organization of people who share the same views about the way power should be used in a country or society"".


NED and TAF, being US Foreign Policy insturments, squarely fit into that description.

For the last two reporting periods (2016 and 2017), Vera Files has been sourcing over half of its operating expenses from these two organizations.

While Vera Files claims that it generates some income from sales, its 2016 Audited Financial Statement (AFS) shows that of the Php 7.8 million in 2016 revenues Php 7.3 million comes from Grants and Donations?

Moreover, Vera Files 2017 Audited Financial Statement shows that its entire Php 6.9 million in 2017 revenues are from Grants and Donations?

A screenshot of Vera Files' 2017 AFS showing revenue sources for 2016 and 2017. Note that virtually all of its revenues come from grants and donations.
And where do over half of these grants and donations come from?

NED and TAF.

A closer look at Vera Files 2016 AFS shows that it generated only Php 2.45 million in revenues in 2015, Php 2.3 million of which is from Donations and Grants.

A screenshot of Vera Files' 2016 AFS showing revenue sources for 2016 and 2015. Note that its revenues TRIPLED as after it received funding from NED and TAF.
That is, NED and TAF tripled Vera Files revenues starting in 2016 which, by the way, is the same year President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office.

This is especially relevant in Vera Files context because the Duterte Administration, i.e. the government of the jurisdiction within which Vera Files operates, is currently clashing with US Foreign Policy as Dutertes independent foreign policy upends Washingtons Pivot to Asia.

How in the world can Vera Files claim non-partisanship when it operates in the Philippines, a country whose Foreign Policy interests clash with those of Vera Files funders?

Should the Poynter Institute, which manages the International Fact-checking Network, reassess Vera Files eligibility as a Fact-checker given that Vera Files receives funding from political parties?

Oh, wait!

NEDs Awarded Grants Database shows Poynter has been receiving NED funding annually since 2015 [NED].

In short, Poynter-IFCN and Vera Files share the same sugar daddy.

"How much has Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, CMFR received from CIA offshoot?","Just how much funding have Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, and CMFR received from the US government-funded CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy (NED)?

Here's data from none other than NED itself.


But before that, let's get to know NED a little more.

NED as a CIA Successor and Collaborator
In his 2008 piece entitled NED et. al.: The CIAs Successors and Collaborators published in both the Canadian Centre for Global Research and Globalization (Global Research) and the French Le Monde Diplomatique, Hernando Calvo Ospina wrote [GlobalResearch]: 
When a scandal in the 1980s revealed the CIAs 35 years of international manipulations, President Ronald Reagan established the National Endowment for Democracy as a more discreet and less controversial instrument. It had the same purpose  to destabilise unfriendly governments by funding the opposition... Although legally an NGO, the NED was funded from the State Department budget, subject to congressional approval
Quoting former US Department of State official William Blum, Ospina wrote:
What was done was to shift many of the awful things [done by the CIA] to a new organisation, with a nice sounding name. The creation of the NED was a masterpiece. Of politics, of public relations, and of cynicism.
An Admission from NEDs founder
No less than NED's founder -- and NED itself -- admitted the claims in Ospina's article.

Asked about NED in a 1991 interview with the Washington Post, NED founder and theoretical planner Allen Weinstein said [WaPo]:
A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA. 
This is corroborated by no less than NED's official website in the History section of its About page [NED], part of which states: 
In the aftermath of World War II. U.S. policy makers resorted to covert means, secretly sending advisers, equipment, and funds to support newspapers and parties under siege in Europe. When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly. 
PVO means Private Voluntary Organizations.

NED's Official Awarded Grants Database
NED has a database of grants that it has so far extended to Philippine organizations, and these include grants to four prominent Duterte Administration critics, namely: 
Vera Files, 
Rappler, 
Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR), and,
Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ).
Vera Files and Rappler are the two fact-checkers of Facebook in the Philippines.
Lets itemize each grant. Note that each dollar-denominated grant is also converted into Philippine pesos using a modest exchange rate of 51 pesos to a dollar.

[29 April 2019 | 09:11 P.M. GMT+8]  UPDATE ON PH MEDIA OUTFITS RECEIVING US GOVERNMENT FUNDING VIA CIA OFFSHOOT NED
It appears that National Endowment for Democracy (NED) Awarded Grants Database shows only grants awarded from 2014 onwards. It doesn't provide data for NED grants prior to 2014.

NED hikes funding during Duterte Administration
President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in 2016. A known US critic, Duterte has made it clear from the onset of his term that he wants a independent foreign policy [TheDiplomat], characterized by lesser dependence on the US and greater co-operation with China.

This is a total departure from the historically pro-US stance of all of Duterte's predecessors since 1946, or when the US recognized Philippine independence, as discussed in the 09 September 2016 ThinkingPinoy article ""Duterte's Philippines breaking away from the United States?""

And true enough, NED since 2016 hiked funding for Philippine media outfits that strongly criticize the Duterte Administration.

Funding Stats
NEDs database shows only CMFR and PCIJ were funded with a total of $258,831 prior to 2016, broken down as follows:
CMFR: $152,000
PCIJ: $ 106,831
On the other hand, the four organizations  CMFR, PCIJ, Vera Files, and Rappler  received a total of $672,434 of funding since 2016, broken down as follows:
CMFR: $ 197,034
PCIJ: $ 135,800
Rappler: $ 142,000
Vera Files: $ 197,600
Here are some notable observations:
NED funding for PCIJ during Dutertes term is 29.6% more than all previous years combined.
NED funding for CMFR during Dutertes term is 27.1% more than all previous years combined.
Total NED funding for these four outfits during Dutertes term increased by 159.8% compared to all previous years combined.
Rappler received $142,000 in 2018 alone, which is more than NEDs total funding received by PCIJ since its inception.
Vera Files is the biggest recipient of NED funding among the four.
Should you bite the hand the feeds you?
NED has awarded a total of $931,265 (Php 47.5 million) to these four organizations. Moreover, over two-thirds of this amount ($672,434 / Php 34.3 million) was awarded from 2016 to 2018, i.e. during the Duterte Administration.

I have always wondered why Rappler, PCIJ, Vera Files, and CMFR have been very critical of the Duterte Administration since Day One. 

In light of the massive funding these four outfits have been receiving from the US Government, however, I finally stopped asking why.

Quoting American writer Upton Sinclair [QI]:
It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!
Will these four outfits ever dare to write anything thats blatantly against US interests?

Here's the complete step-by-step guide to uncovering Metro Balita's owner,"Two Manila Times columnists  former ambassador Rigoberto Bobi Tiglao and Maastricht University lecturer Sass Rogando Sasot  have written about this, but I like having all bases covered, so here we go.


In early April 2019, a series of videos with the common title Ang Totoong Narco List (Translation: The Real Narco List, now more popularly known as the Bikoy Videos circulated online.

The videos, through an anonymous informant with alias Bikoy, allege that members of the Duterte presidential family received massive drug payolas, including President Rodrigo Dutertes son Paolo Pulong Duterte, son-in-law Manases Mans Carpio, and 14-year-old daughter Veronica Kitty Duterte, a minor.
In her ABS-CBN News column, Facebook fact-checker Ellen Tordesillas of Vera Files said the videos were riveting and, along with the annotations, look professionally done.

It appears, however, that Tordesillass standards for professional video creation are skin-deep.


A look at the payola documents featured in the Bikoy videos show that these are just a bad a case of photoshop, as shown below [http://bit.ly/2UHwCig]:


Aside from the excellent lighting and choice of text overlays, the video itself is amateurish at best, as the supposed payola payout lists, which the entire video series relies upon for credibility, are just fake documents.

Potential Court Cases
Libel punishable under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code is obvious, but given the videos online nature, parties can sue for Cyber Libel punishable under Section 4 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act (RA 10175).

Sasot also called for an RPC Article 154 test case in her 25 April 2019 Manila Times column Who is behind Metro Balita?.


I believe Sasot is justified as Bikoy Videos attempted to implicate no less the presidential family, whose integrity (or the perception of it) may be considered a national security concern. That is, parties may also sue for unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances punishable under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 10951.

Aside from these, Veronica Kitty Duterte, being a minor, may also sue for violence against children punishable under Section 5 the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (RA 9262), which forbids causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to [a] child.

I don't know for certain which one of these should be filed: that's a problem for the Duterte's.

I am more interested in who's behind the Bikoy Videos.

Tiglao gives a lead
In his 22 April 2019 Manila Times column  Vile video vs Duterte the work of Otso Diretso, Trillanes writer and US-funded websites, Amb. Bobi Tiglao wrote:
cyber-crime experts found the Bikoy video to have been first uploaded to YouTube by a website www.metrobalita.net.
Metrobalita.net was taken down by its owner as soon as Tiglaos column came out.

Whats clear, however, is that Tiglao showed that the person/s behind the Bikoy Videos and the one/s behind MetroBalita are the same.

Tracing Google AdSense Publisher IDs
Tracing ownership of Google AdSense accounts, called a Reverse AdSense Lookup, is an effective way to unmask people, as was shown in the 29 September 2017 ThinkingPinoy article #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for. The article revealed the identity of the web administrator of SilentNoMorePH, the site that published libelous statements against several sitting senators.

The process is fairly simple:
1. Extract the unique Google AdSense Publisher ID of a given site.
2. Cross-reference to other websites that run online ads from the same Publisher ID.
3. Check who owns those other websites.

Step 1: extract ID from MetroBalita.net
Through an online third-party utility, Sasot was able to extract MetroBalita.Nets Publisher ID, which is:
ca-pub-9287075011637877
I did an independent verification using DNSlytics Reverse AdSense Lookup and the results corroborate Sasots findings, as shown below:



Step 2: Check for other sites using the same Google Publisher ID
Using the online third-party utility SpyOnWeb [A], I found that Google AdSense Publisher ID on MetroBalita.net is identical to the one used in MetroBalita.com, as shown below:


That is, whoever owns MetroBalita.Net and MetroBalita.Com must be the same person.

Step 3: Check for domain registry information
I did a quick WhoIs lookup on MetroBalita.net and MetroBalita.com. As expected, both use a domain privacy service so the site owners real name is undisclosed.

However, a deeper WhoIs history lookup using DomainTools shows that MetroBalita.coms owner publicly released his personal details when he initially registered MetroBalita.com in 14 May 2017, as shown in the following screenshot:

This is further corroborated by another online third-party tool Whoxy:


It is also worthy to note that MetroBalitas twitter account lists metrobalita.com as its official website:


Note that Metro Balita's twitter has been operating with metrobalita.net since the beginning of April 2019, as evidenced by a 21 April 2019 denial tweet:

Note that the same tweet is an admission that MetroBalita uploaded the Bikoy Videos, at least using the online assets that MetroBalita owns or controls.

Yes, all evidence points to a certain Rodel Jayme.

Who is Rodel Jayme?
A quick google search of Rodel Jayme leads us to the blog site jrodel0991.wordpress.com whose about page states that his twitter account is http://www.twitter.com/jrodel.

According to his Twitter Bio:
Rodel Jayme
@jrodel
Blogger, Gamer, License Amateur Radio Operator (DY1VDA) Discord: JRodel0991#1410 / Steam: jrodel / Twitch: jrodel0991
Judging from his tweets,  Jayme is a staunch Liberal Party supporter and a staunch Duterte critic.



Judging from his tweets, Jayme is a staunch LP supporter, as he has attended several Liberal Party events in the past.

A 28 June 2017 tweet shows he was attended Vice-president Leni Robredos #IstoryaNgPagAsa social media launch in 28 Jun 2017. An 02 July 2016 tweet shows hes also a member of the Liberal Party-aligned Democratic Warriors FB Group.


Aside from these, I also archived his tweets featuring other Liberal Party Personalities including one with Aquino Education Sec. Armin Luistro, another with Aquino Social Welfare Sec. Dinky Soliman, and another with Aquino Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya.

In another tweet, he also actively campaigned for Mar Roxas during the latters failed 2016 presidential bid:


Interestingly, another tweet suggests that Jayme is also acquainted with a certain Erlo Bornales of Mamamayang Alyansang Reporma (MAR):


MAR was featured in the 08 March 2016 ThinkingPinoy article Roxas has his own Internet Army?. In that article, it was shown that the group has been training its members as part of an online social media army:


Jayme, through Metro Balita, has been actively campaigning for VP Leni Robredo legal counsel and Liberal Party senatorial bet Romulo Macalintal. It's funny that Metro Balita tweets mostly about relatively unremarkable Macalintal, suggesting that there may be a link between the two.
Flight as a sign of guilt
Based on publicly available and independently verifiable online data, its clear that Rodel Jayme owns MetroBalita.net.

If juxtaposed to Tiglaos findings, then Rodel Jayme must have uploaded the Bikoy videos to YouTube, though its still unclear to me how the said cybercrime experts managed to link MetroBalita with the Ang Totoong Narco List youtube account.

In People v Tecson (G.R. No. 194234):
Jurisprudence has repeatedly declared that flight is an indication of guilt. The flight of an accused, in the absence of a credible explanation, would be a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be established for a truly innocent person would normally grasp the first available opportunity to defend himself and to assert his innocence.
Well, it appears that Jayme is actively deleting posts related to the Bikoy Videos. He has taken down the MetroBalita website (both .com and .net), Metrobalitas facebook video uploads, and other related posts.

Jayme may not be running away from authorities right now, but he sure did allow the evidence to fly away first",RJ Nieto,04/26/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/04/heres-complete-step-by-step-guide-to.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
MARIA RESSAS CYBER LIBEL: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CONVICTION IS HIGHLY LIKELY,"I earlier wondered why Maria Ressa and her media allies never mentioned anything about the truthfulness of the report upon which Wilfredo Keng's libel suit was based.

I got the answer a day later, when I got hold of a letter [PDEA] dated 15 August 2016 from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, addressed to what I presume to be Keng's lawyer. The letter stated that Keng, at least as of the letter's writing, had NO DEROGATORY RECORD in PDEA's database.

Rappler never took down the assailed news article, despite knowing full well that all it has is merely an intelligence report while Keng has an official document proving the contrary.

Rappler, in short, published a VERIFIABLE FALSEHOOD.

MAINSTREAM MEDIA DEFENDING FAKE NEWS
Infallibility in reporting is impossible, but when faced with more reliable controverting information post-publication, responsible journalists are supposed to issue errata. The insistence of a publisher on the initial claim, despite more convincing evidence to the contrary, is what can be considered to be FAKE NEWS.

In short, all media men defending Maria Ressa vis-a-vis this libel case are essentially defending not the Right to Free Speech, but the non-existent Right to Publish Verifiably False Information.

I find this utterly hypocritical, as these are the same media men who have been decrying the supposed proliferation of Fake News, as they defend Maria Ressa as she lies through her teeth.

If an article verifiably misinforms, what exactly is the point of defending it in the Court of Public Opinion? Have the members of mainstream media started to look up to Joseph Goebbels?

Philippine Star columnist Carmen Pedrosa hit the nail on the head when she said:
Maria Ressa's story is not about about ""Freedom of the Press"" but her Freedom to Lie.
And Ressas mainstream media sympathizers are part of that fight.

DEFENSE BASED ON TECHNICALITIES
Ressa, through various media outlets, raised three defenses:

FIRST, that the act was committed in early 2012, i.e. prior to the cyber libel laws enactment in late 2012, thereby allowing Ressa to enjoy constitutional protection against ex post facto laws.

However, as the Justice Department correctly pointed out in its resolution on Keng v Ressa [DoJ], that the 2014 update of the Keng-Corona article makes the case fall under the Multiple Publication rule, where each and every publication of the same libel constitutes a distinct offense.

SECOND, that there was a Temporary Restraining Order on the Cyber Libel Law when the article was updated in 2014, so that the Cyber Libel Law cannot be invoked.

The Supreme Court indeed issued a TRO pending a decision on the constitutionality of several provisions, including Cyber Libel, of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 [GMANews].

Unfortunately for Ressa, The TRO was lifted on 11 February 2014 when the High Court ruled on Disini v Secretary of Justice [G.R. No. 203335], while the Rappler updated the Keng-Corona article 19 February 2014.

Rappler committed the act EIGHT DAYS after the Cyber Libel Law became fully active.

THIRD, that the prescriptive period for filing a case has lapsed. Ressa argues that Keng cant sue her anymore because libel can be filed only up to a year after Keng found out about it.

Acts punishable under the Revised Penal Code, which includes libel, have a prescriptive period of one year as explained in People v Gines [G.R. No. 83463].

Some camps argue, however, that Cyber Libel is covered under a special law (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012), so that the prescriptive period, given that the its punishable by a minimum of 4 years imprisonment, should be eight years per CA 3326, which states [ChanRobles]:
Violations penalized by special acts shall prescribe after eight years for those punished by imprisonment for two years or more...
However, other camps argue that RA 4661 trumps CA 3326 as it states:
""The crime of libel or other similar offenses shall prescribe in one year.
The one-year prescription period theory is problematic.
RA 4661 Sec. 1 clearly states that it amends only Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code.

RA 4661 says nothing about prescriptive period of criminal complaints arising from special laws, and the case filed against Ressa is based on the Cybercrime Prevention Act, a special law.


Moreover, Keng filed the complaint in 2012 or shortly after the initial publication of the Rappler article, or well within a year after the discovery of the libelous statement.

So no, a defense based on prescriptive period likely wont hold water.

Moreover, state prosecutors can even explore the Search Engine Optimization angle.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine like Google.
Whenever Rappler engages in SEO, it promotes ALL CONTENTS of the Rappler website, including the Keng-Corona article. That is, Ressa reiterates the defamatory statement everytime her company does SEO.
And how often does Rappler do SEO? ALL THE TIME.
Defenses relying on prescriptive periods and ex post facto laws should not hold by virtue of the multiple publication rule and Rapplers continual SEO practices.

Now that weve gotten the technicalities out of the way, its time to discuss the merits of the case, i.e. whether all the elements constituting online libel are present in Kengs complaint.


LIBEL CONVICTIONS AND MARIAS LEGAL DEFENSE
TRUTH IS NOT A DEFENSE in libel cases with private complainants such as the one Keng filed against Ressa et Al. However, the point in my wonderment over Ressas reluctance to use truth as a defense is my curiosity as to what defenses Ressas legal team will employ.

But before I elaborate on that, let me first explain how a libel conviction can be had.


Like any other criminal case, the prosecution must convince the court of the presence of the elements of the crime of libel.

Here are the elements of libel [BatasNatin]:
 The defamatory imputation which, in this case, is tagging Keng as a drug smuggler and human trafficker, as it clearly lowers the respect in which Keng is regarded. 
 The publication of libelous matter which, in this case, is the 2014 update of the Keng-Corona article. Ressa argues that the article was published in 2012 before the Cyber Libel Law. The article's 2014 update, as the Justice Department correctly argues, was done AFTER the law's enactment.
 The complainant was identified and he sure was, as the article clearly stated the name Wilfredo Keng.
 There must be malice, as is the case. Citing Ateneos Dean Tony La Via in his 2014 [Manila Standard] column, Philippine libel law creates the presumption that malice is present in every defamatory imputation.
Since Ressas is a cyber libel case, then a fifth element is required:
 Online publication, and this is pretty obvious, with Rappler being an online-only media organization.
The first three elements, along with the fifth, are hardly contestable, and any defense counsel worth his salt will focus his energies in debunking the supposed presence of the fourth element: malice.


More specifically, Ressa must show, for starters, that the Presumption of Malice does not hold in this case.

OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF MALICE
I am a long-time political blogger, a radio commentator, a newspaper columnist and a subject of a pending and relatively high-profile libel case filed by Antonio Trillanes, a sitting senator of the Philippines. I have carefully studied and took to heart libel laws not only because I find them interesting, but because I have to, for my own good.

After all, as the veteran journalist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in her 15 February 2019 [Daily Tribune] column aptly puts, journalists should know that libel is part of the territory.

By the way, Cacho-Olivares has successfully defended herself against at least two libel cases: one filed by former Ilocos Sur Governor Chavit Singson in 2001, and another by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyos then personal lawyer Pancho Villaraza in 2002.

Going back to topic and after consulting several lawyer-friends, four out of the five elements of libel (imputation, publication, identification, and online nature) are hardly disputable, so that her legal team should focus on debunking the last one, which is Presumption of Malice, as described in Yuchengco v Manila Chronicle [G.R. No. 184315]:
There is a presumption of malice in the case of every defamatory imputation, where there is no showing of a good intention or justifiable motive for making such imputation.
Most journalists debunk this presumption via the oft-used Public Figure Doctrine, part of which was expounded in the landmark Guingging v CA [G.R. No. 128959], which states:
If the statements made against the public figure are essentially true, then no conviction for libel can be had.
That is, Ressa must show that Keng:
 is a public figure, and  
 that the drug trafficker claim is essentially true.

ESSENTIAL TRUTHFULNESS OF INTELLIGENCE REPORTS
Unfortunately for Ressa and as shown in previous sections, Rapplers demonstrably reckless disregard for the veracity of the Keng-Corona article prevents Ressa from taking refuge in this doctrine.

Keng is a private businessman so he may not be considered a public figure at first glance. However, with a few legal acrobatic maneuvers, Ressas legal team may argue that he is a limited-purpose public figure, in light of the Rappler Keng-Corona articles claim that Keng granted then Chief Justice Corona favors.

Supposing that Keng is a public figure for the sake of argument, Ressa then needs to show that its essentially true that Keng is a drug trafficker.

Lets go back to the basics by quoting Rapplers Keng-Corona article:
we got hold of an intelligence report that detailed Keng's past. Prepared in 2002 The report stated that Keng had been under surveillance by the National Security Council for alleged involvement in human trafficking and drug smuggling.
In fairness to Ressa, the drug trafficker tag in Keng-Corona article in 2012 is essentially true as Rappler cited intelligence reports apparently sourced from the National Security Council. The problem, however, is that intelligence reports do not bear the same weight as official documents from law enforcement agencies.

Borrowing the Prussian war general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz words:
Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain. In short, most intelligence is false.[George and Kline 2006]
While intelligence reports are highly fallible, it can still be argued that, in the absence of weightier evidence to the contrary and considering that the Corona Impeachment Trial is a Public Interest issue, information cited from such documents are essentially true.

In short, if Keng sued Ressa for the 2012 article and that article alone, an acquittal is not unlikely.

But Ressa isnt out of the woods just yet.

MARIA RESSA'S RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR TRUTH OR FALSITY
Aside from the Rapplers source being an intelligence report, the claim becomes even more problematic as Rappler did not even cite who prepared it. While Rappler mentioned the National Security Council, it didnt say it was from the same agency. After all, an intelligence report can be based upon another intelligence report.

Regardless, with the assumption that Keng is a public figure, Ressa can argue that the 2012 Rappler article forwarded an essentially truthful claim, so that no libel conviction can be had in as far as the 2012 article is concerned.

In libel cases involving public figures, the complainant has must prove that Actual Malice is present, as explained in Borjal v CA [G.R. No. 126466]:
The guarantees of freedom of speech and press prohibit a public figure from recovering damages unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.
That is, complainant Keng must prove that there was Actual Malice. That is, he must be able to convince the court that Ressa demonstrated a reckless disregard of whether the drug trafficker claim was false or not.

And heres where it gets SUPER interesting.

PUBLIC FIGURES AND ACTUAL MALICE
The series of events that followed the articles 2012 publication suggest that there indeed was Actual Malice on Ressas part.

In a 14 Feb 2019 official statement, Keng said [MindaNews]:

I tried to communicate with Rappler in order to have the said article taken down, clear my name and restore my reputation
Keng added:
In turn, Rappler repeatedly promised me that they will take down the subject article, but never did. The libelous attacks remain posted on their website until now.
Assuming that Keng can provide evidence (emails, SMS messages or whatnot) that Rappler indeed promised to take down the article, then Rapplers continual failure to take the article down (its still up as I write this piece) screams Actual Malice.

Moreover, the 2016 PDEA letter reinforces Kengs case as it stated:
Record check shows Keng has no derogatory record on file.
It has been over two years since that letters writing, and it would safe to assume that Keng has notified Rappler about it.

The 2016 PDEA Letter 
Despite all of these, the Rappler's Keng-Corona article is still up.

This bears repeating:
Even with the assumption that Ressa published the 2012 article in good faith, subsequent events showed that Ressa insisted on keeping the article online and for everyone to see even after having been provided weightier controverting evidence, and even after her organization itself acknowledged the gross inaccuracy of the report when it promised Keng to take the article down.
Ressa showed reckless disregard of whether the drug trafficker claim was false or not.

Actual Malice is present.

Ressa even hurt her prospects for acquittal when she went on a global media blitz after DOJ served the arrest warrant, as her recent actions just point towards the fact that Ressa doesn't care if she's publishing what is VERIFIABLY FAKE NEWS.

Ressas insistence on publishing defamatory statements with reckless disregard for their truthfulness, making a conviction for Cyber Libel highly likely. Hence, it appears that Ressa may be the first person in Philippine History to be convicted for such an offense.

As far as I can see, Ressa will go to jail.",RJ Nieto,02/16/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/02/maria-ressa-cyber-libel-how-solve.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Parents: DOH bangkay chasers buy evidence from Dengvaxia victims,"A child holding a Dengvaxia Card.
Its been over a year since the Dengvaxia Scandal erupted in November 2017. Since then, the Public Attorneys Office (PAO) with its chief Atty. Persida Acosta has autopsied the bodies of over a hundred vaccinees, a vast majority of whom are school-age children who received the vaccine through the botched 2016 school-based vaccination program of the Department of Health (DOH), led by then Secretary Janette Garin.

PAO has already filed a number of criminal, civil, and administrative cases against the perpetrators of what could possibly be the biggest case of medical practice in Modern History.

Justice, however, remains elusive, as several of the victims parents came forward and accused todays Department of Health of attempting to buy evidence from them, which would make it more difficult for the victims families to secure convictions against the culprits.


Todays Health Department is headed by Secretary Francisco Duque, who previously was a DOH consultant reporting directly to Noynoy Aquino-era DOH Sec. Janette Garin.

The Basics of Filing a Dengvaxia Case
President Rodrigo Duterte tasked the Public Attorneys Office was tasked by to handle Dengvaxia cases of any affected family who requests for assistance.

To initiate a formal complaint, PAO logically asks every complainant to submit medical records that shall be used as supporting evidence, including:

1. Dengvaxia Card  A small card issued by the DOH at the time of vaccination, detailing the who was vaccinated, where the vaccination took place, and when the recipient received Dengvaxia doses. This serves as prima facie evidence that the child indeed received Dengvaxia.
2. Death Certificate  This document states the date and cause of death.

3. Medical Abstract  A concise summary of the Dengvaxia recipients condition, usually issued by a qualified medical professional around the time of the recipients death.
Without these basic documents, winning a Dengvaxia case will be severely prolonged, if not impossible.

But theres a problem.

Several Dengvaxia parents recently told PAO that the Department of Health has been attempting to get their original records in exchange for Php 50,0000 medical assistance. While its true that President Duterte instructed DOH to extend financial assistance, the President DID NOT order DOH to take away evidence from the victims kin.

But thats what DOH did. 

DoH buys evidence

[Click here for copy of sworn affidavit.]
Umattend ako ng conference tungkol sa Dengvaxia victims noong Setyembre 2018 sa DOH at doon ko napag-alaman na may Php 50,000 silang ibibigay basta kumpletuhin lang ang mga requirements [tulad ng] certification na na-inject ng Dengvaxia Vaccine (Dengvaxia Card).
TRANSLATION: I attended a conference about Dengvaxia victims in September 2018 at the DOH and I learned from there that they have Php 50,000 to give out as soon as we complete the requirements like the certification that our child was injected with Dengvaxia.

DOH's efforts? Not only at the grassroots
The statements quoted in the previous section detail the Health Departments attempts at the grassroots level to sabotage the cases of Dengvaxia victims. To add insult to injury, DOH used President Dutertes own name to steal evidence away from the victims, even if helping the victims is the only thing President Duterte said.

In November 2018, the Public Attorneys Office wrote to DOH Region 7, asking the latter for the Dengvaxia Card, death certificate, and other original documents that the latter received from a Cebu City complainant.


In response, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said he cant provide the documents because they have already been sent to DOH Central in Manila,  as shown in the letter below:

In short, Dengvaxia victims who availed of the P50,000 assistance will find it even harder to file a case, let alone secure a conviction, because DOH is holding their evidence hostage in exchange for a measly sum of Php 50,000.

But the DOHs efforts do not end there. Several top-ranking government officials and even a very prominent Dengvaxia advocate have been attempting to persuade PAO Chief Acosta to exonerate DOH Sec. Duque.


This is despite their knowledge that such a proposal, aside from being a a ground for disbarment of PAO lawyers, is a shameless betrayal to the Dengvaxia victims who want nothing but justice for their dead children.

Fortunately, PAO has consistently and vehemently objected to these advances.

Thank you, PAO Chief Acosta.",RJ Nieto,02/02/2019,http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/02/parents-doh-bangkay-chasers-buy-evidence.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
