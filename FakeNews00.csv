Pres. Duterte to trap Cayetano today? Alan Peter still has way out,"Evidence suggests that President Rodrigo Duterte may have put Speaker Cayetano on the horns of a dilemma, between Scylla and Charybdis, between the devil and the deep blue sea, between a rock and a hard place. 

But before we go any further, let me state that the special sessions that President Duterte ordered  should be enough to pass the 2021 National Budget in the House of Representatives. That is, the nations primary concern, a COVID-19 budget, should not be a problem anymore, thanks to PRRDs intervention.


With that said, we can now discuss the secondary issue, the ongoing speakership war.

Lets start with the facts
Here's what happened so far:
1. The House holds regular sessions on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesday .

2. Per the current legislative calendar mutually agreed upon by the House and the Senate , the suspension of session is slated on 17 October 2020, so there should be regular sessions on 12-14 October 2020 (Monday to Wednesday).

3. However, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano prematurely declared a suspension of session on 06 October 2020 , thereby cancelling the 12-14 October 2020 session days.

4. President Duterte views this suspension as illegal and unconstitutional .

5. Dutertes view is seconded by Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo publicly said Cayetanos move to suspend House Sessions is unconstitutional per Sec 16, Art VI, of the Constitution .

6. President Duterte issued a proclamation ordering special sessions on 13 to 16 October 2020 . Interestingly, these dates exclude Monday, 12 October 2020.
Interestingly, PRRD did not include, 12 October 2020, in the schedule of special sessions he ordered, and that decision may be a trap that can ensnare Cayetano.

What trap are you talking about?
Today, which is supposed to be regular session day, Speaker Cayetano has only two possible courses of action: 
1. Keep the suspension in place 

2. Lift the suspension and convene the House 
Lets elaborate.

CAYETANOS FIRST OPTION: KEEP SESSION SUSPENDED
If Cayetano decides to keep sessions suspended, that would be a cancellation of sessions on October 7th (Tuesday), October 8th (Wednesday), and October 12th (Monday, today). Hence, Cayetano would be openly defying President Duterte, who views this move as unconstitutional.

In short, if Cayetano keeps doesnt hold a regular session today, then thats Cayetanos de facto withdrawal of support for the Duterte Administration. If Cayetano does this, he loses any remaining opportunity to plausibly deny his loss of support for PRRD.

Imagine, the President and his chief legal counsel already said that what Cayetanos doing is unconstitutional but Cayetano still insists on doing it? The president repeatedly says that he hates being humiliated, and this brazen defiance on Cayetanos part qualifies as a humiliation.

Moreover, a majority of House members may still opt to convene today despite the suspension by invoking majority in numbers (power to the greater number) and the constitutional duty to pass the budget to meet a national emergency (the COVID-19 pandemic).

That is, Cayetano may try to prevent a session, but a session may happen anyway. And if a session happens, that will lead us to the next scenario.

SECOND OPTION: LIFT SUSPENSION, CONVENE 12 OCT 2020
If Cayetano decides to follow the Constitution by lifting the suspension and convenes a regular House session today per the legislative calendar, he opens himself up to the possibility of ouster from the speakership.

Reports indicate that at least 200 members (two-thirds) of the House are now backing Velasco . Add the fact that Velasco appears to have the backing of President Duterte himself  and his likely successor, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte .

Given PRRDs 91% approval rating this late in his term , Saras 2022 chances are quite rosy, so any administration-aligned congressman with an instinct for political survival will not be as defiant as Cayetano.

Case in point is the hastily conducted Sunday press conference in the House , attended by LRay Villafuerte (NP), Pidi Barzaga (NUP), Egay Erice (LP), Mike Defensor (Party-List Coalition), Prospero Pichay (Lakas), and Benny Abante (NUP).

After viewing that presser, I observed that all of the attendees dodged the speakership issue, except LRay Villafuerte and Benny Abante, who were vocally against a speakership change. Everybody sees Villafuerte as Cayetanos de facto right-hand guy so thats not surprising. Meanwhile, Abante belongs to the House Minority, so his stance isnt surprising either.


Moreover, whats more interesting is not a single cabinet official has come forward to defend Cayetano after the October 6th suspension of sessions.

That is, it appears that Cayetano and Villafuerte, after overplaying their cards, are on their own.

A Sliver of Hope for Alan Peter
Given the discussion above, there are three primary possibilities:

POSSIBILITY 1: Cayetano openly defies Duterte by keeping the suspension despite Dutertes view that its unconstitutional, which would eject Cayetano from the Duterte Coalition.

POSSIBILITY 2: The first possibility happens, then the majority of House Members proceed to hold a session and oust Cayetano.

POSSIBILITY 3: Cayetano lifts suspension and convenes session today, only to be ousted.

These three possibilities indicate that Cayetanos prospects are bleak. However, he may still have some hope in the numbers game.

While Velascos camp claims support of 200 congressmen, it is likely that the estimate is bloated, and that leads us to


POSSIBILITY 4: Cayetano convenes session today and remains as speaker.

To replace Cayetano, Velasco needs support from 153 out of 304 sitting solons. So far, only PDP-Laban, NPC, and the Party-list Coalition (led by Mikee Romero) has openly declared support for Velasco. In as far as numbers, PDP Laban has about 63 solons, NPC has 33, Party-list Coalition has 54. Combining the numbers of these three parties, we get 150.

Thats a total of 150 members, or about 3 short of the 153 required. Now, Inday Saras Hugpong ng Pagbabago has 3 solons and Pro-Duterte Partido Federal has 8 members, and that brings the total to 164, which would be more than enough to constitute a majority.

But even the bigger political parties suffering from varying degrees of factionalism. For example, PDP has a 4-member Zamora Faction that may opt to support Cayetano. There have also been a few defections over the past couple of years.

That is, Velasco may not get all the 164 votes from those congressmen listed. Worse, he may get less than 153, which would make his speakership bid fail.

Nacionalista is expected to vote mostly for its party-mate Cayetano. NUP, another large party, appears to be split on the speakership issue .

With that said, this may put the 19-member Lakas  headed by Majority Leader Martin Romualdez  in a very interesting position. With such numbers, Lakas may decide who becomes speaker, i.e. whether Cayetano remains or Velasco rises. 

Will Lakas be the clincher?
Let me spell this out for you.

Theres a pretty good possibility that Romualdezs Lakas may serve as the clincher vote. If Lakas supports Velasco, then Cayetano may be ousted. If Lakas supports Cayetano, Cayetano may remain as speaker.

With that said, Romualdezs recent announcement. i.e. speakership vote but only after budget deliberations, i.e. no speakership vote on Monday, is an interesting decision.

With that pronouncement, Romualdez enlarges his bargaining chip in the House Speakership race. Romualdez can leverage his partys potentially crucial 19 votes to gain more power in the House.

But then, Lakas-CMDs decision will be decided by the two primary factors:

First, the quality of Cayetanos offer and whether Velasco is willing match or exceed it.

A closely contested speakership race like this one means that the challenger may have to divide the power pie among fewer solons, as opposed to the incumbent which has to cater to the supermajority. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that Velasco will likely be able to match whatever Cayetano will offer to Lakas.

Second, the opinion of Lakas-CMDs leadership.

The ghosts of Cayetanos past may hound him. Lakas-CMDs incumbent chairman is Senator Ramon Bong Revilla Jr, whose past pork barrel-related incarceration was at least partly due to Cayetanos attacks . Meanwhile, senior Lakas member and former President Gloria-Macapagal Arroyo, to put it extremely lightly, is not exactly fond of Cayetano .

To cut the long story short, Lakas members at first glance appear to be thinking long and hard, but it seems like its just waiting for Cayetanos challenger to woo them a bit more.

The odds appear to be stacked against Speaker Cayetano, but he seems to have a reed-thin sliver of hope to slither his way out of this kerfuffle. 

Yes, Cayetano will likely fail to wiggle his way out of this, but it's not an impossibility.

Today will be a very exciting day for political observers like me.",RJ Nieto,"October 12, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/10/pres-duterte-to-trap-cayetano-today.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Duterte's precarious hold on power and the future of the Liberal Party,"Being a Philippine President is like being the driver of the car called ""the Philippine Government."" Winning in 2016 is Duterte driver's license, but a license is not enough. 

Duterte also needs  fuel for the engines, and  lubricants to keep the car's parts from breaking down. He fuels the car with tax revenues then he lubricates its parts using political power so that other politicians  the car parts  follow his lead.

To be an effective president, Duterte needs a constant supply of funds (mostly via tax money) and political power (political influence). Unfortunately, the President is currently having difficulty securing both.


First, COVID-induced economic contractions mean lower tax collections. 

But lower revenues have a pretty straightforward solution: austerity measures coupled with loans until the economy gets back on its feet. Diminished influence, however, is much more complicated. 

Second, some of the President's supposedly staunchest allies are undermining his political influence.

Recent events indicate an attempt to decimate much of Duterte's political power (the ""government lubricant"") that will render him unable to make the government car run the way he wants.

For this nation's sake, I do not want that. I need to protect this President until his term ends in June 2022. 

1: Depowering a President 
Let's first talk about the basics. 

There are three basic methods to depower a president.

First is by the expiration of term of office. This one is obvious, so it needs no further discussion.

Second is by impeachment. This one is also obvious, so it needs no lengthy discussion. Note that Estrada, while impeached in the House of Representatives, wasn't convicted in the Senate. While the Senate impeachment trial did, instead, was to catalyze a coup d'etat, which we shall expound in the next method. 

EDSA Dos ended with Estrada leaving Malacanang.

Third is by coup d'etat, such as the removal of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 through the romanticized coup d'etat that EDSA Uno, more popularly known as the People Power Revolution. Another example is President Joseph Estrada, who was removed in 2001 through EDSA Dos and while an impeachment trial was still ongoing. 

President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo could have suffered the same fate in 2001 during EDSA Tres, but that attempt failed. Unlike the first two EDSA uprisings, critical power blocs like the military and the Roman Catholic Church supported the sitting government. 

EDSA Tres didn't work because it had no military support.

2: Depowering Rodrigo Duterte
Should President Duterte be concerned about these three methods?

No big deal here. Term expiration is not an issue because that's what the 1987 Constitution wants. 

Impeachment is highly unlikely. 

Duterte has at least nine senators who will mostly take his side, namely:  Pacquiao,  Dela Rosa,  Go,  Pimentel,  Tolentino,  Sotto,  Marcos,  Revilla, and  Villar. Conviction, which requires at least 16 senatorial votes out of the possible 24, is improbable.

A coup d'etat is also unlikely. 

Like President Arroyo, Duterte has coup-proofed his reign through  his aggressive courtship of the military , and  drastic diminution of the already diminished political influence of the Roman Catholic Church. With a politically defanged church and with significant military support, an anti-Duterte EDSA revolution won't happen. 

Remember when PRRD visit one military camp after another during the start of his term? That wasn't for nothing.


3: The Lame Duck
All three methods require Duterte to exit Malacaang, and we see that none of them pose a real threat against him. But leaving Malacaang need not always be an ingredient.

President Duterte can still lose power without the need for removal, and that's by turning him into ""lame duck"".

A lame duck is an official with political power so diminished that he's reduced to a ceremonial head, with other persons (or groups of persons) exercising actual power.

For example, days before US President Barack Obama stepped down in 2017, the Trump predecessor jested: 
""You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions "".
US President Barack Obama

Trump's 2017 win turned Obama into a lame duck in the same way Duterte's 2016 win turned President Aquino into the same. 

So why did I bring this issue up? 

4: The Anatomy of Political Influence
Is President Duterte at risk of losing significant power, significant enough to prevent him from controlling the Philippine Government Machinery?

The answer, right now, is yes.

Political influence comes from two primary sources: 
mass popularity, and,
support from political power blocs. 
But heres some bad news: history shows that mass popularity is indispensable only during the election season, but support from political power blocs is necessary for the rest of the term. 

For example, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo won the 1998 vice-presidency by a landslide  but her popularity charted new depths each year. Despite becoming more unpopular than her deposed predecessor Erap Estrada , she still managed to hold on to power until 2010 because she enjoyed the support of most major political power blocs. 

Arroyo deftly maintained support from the military.

Now, does Duterte enjoy the same?

The first ingredient is present: Duterte got a sky-high 91 percent approval rating in the September 2020 Pulse Asia Survey . 

The second ingredient, meanwhile, is derived from the Duterte Coalition, also known as ""Kilusang Pagbabago (Coalition for Change)"", which primarily consists of the following political groups:
Duterte's own PDP-Laban, which includes speaker hopeful Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco belongs,
Senator Cynthia Villar's Nacionalista Party (NP), which includes Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano,
Former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's Lakas-CMD, which includes Majority Leader Martin Romualdez,
Lakas-CMD breakaway group National Unity Party (NUP), which includes presidential son Paolo Duterte, and,
Danding Cojuangco's Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC), which includes Senate President Vicente ""Tito"" Sotto
The Party-list Bloc, led by 1Pacman Rep. Mikee Romero.
Note that Big Business (read: the billionaires) is also a political power bloc, but most billionaires are aligned with one or more of the six political groups listed above.

Aside from running the Executive Branch, Duterte needs to keep the alliance supportive of his decisions, which was the case, at least until right after the 2019 midterm elections. 

5: Three Power Tussles over the Next Best Things
Every political party wants to get top positions in government. Since there can only be one Philippine President, they aim for the next best things: 
the Senate Presidency and, 
the House Speakership. 
Note that the Vice-presidency is also a top position but let's be honest here: the VP is just a ceremonial official for as long as the President is still alive and kicking. 

Members of Kilusang Pagbabago vie for these posts, and very public conflicts ensue.

Kilusang Pagbabagos first internal power tussle happened in 2016 when then-Senator Alan Peter Cayetano (NP) fought Senator Koko Pimentel (PDP Laban) for the Senate Presidency. 

Pimentel and Cayetano.

Pimentel prevailed . But as a compromise, Duterte later made Cayetano Foreign Secretary . ThinkingPinoy explained this 2016 drama in detail in the ""Duterte, Cayetano, Pimentel: Inside Info on the Senate Presidency"" Part One  and Part Two .

The second major power tussle was in 2018 when Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (LAKAS) snatched the speakership from Davao del Norte Rep. Bebot Alvarez (PDP Laban) . 

Recall this moment?

But despite these inter-party conflicts, all members of this Duterte Coalition sought Presidents blessing before they took any step.

Yes, the Executive shouldn't meddle with the Legislative, but Duterte isn't just a Chief Executive. Separate and distinct from this presidency is his chairmanship of the PDP Laban, the leading party within the Duterte Coalition. These bickering camps consulted Duterte as its coalition head and not as the Philippine President.

Duterte's ability to rein in these feuding parties is evidence of the second ingredient, the support from the political power blocs.

With two ingredients readily available (mass popularity and support from political power blocs), Duterte more easily advanced his 10-point socioeconomic agenda. For example, he used these ingredients to quickly secure congressional funding and approval for many projects listed in the ambitious Build Build Build infrastructure program .

The third power tussle wasn't as bloody, as it was when Senate President Koko Pimentel (PDP Laban) stepped down for Senator Tito Sotto (NPC), telling the latter that the leadership transition shall be implemented ""with the minimum disruption.""

We all hoped that the fourth power tussle, the one for the 2019 speakership, would follow the same tack as the third, but it didnt. And this is when the second ingredient  support from political power blocs  started to become a problem for Duterte. 

6: Cayetano announced Speakership Bid
Cayetano resigned from DFA in October 2018  and told media that he ""will seek the leadership position in the House . "" He then mounted a successful bid for the congressional seat in Cayetano bulwark Taguig's 1st District . Further boosting his speakership chances is the election of his wife Lani Cayetano as representative of Taguig's 2nd District , albeit not without controversy .

Yes, Cayetano announced his speakership ambitions in advance, but other parties in the Duterte Coalition didn't join the chorus.

Four candidates for the speakership emerged after the May 2019 Elections :
1. Taguig 1st Dist. Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano (NP)

2. Marinduque Lone Dist. Rep. Lord Allan Velasco (PDP Laban)

3. Leyte 1st Dist. Rep. Martin Romualdez (LAKAS)

4. Former speaker and Davao del Norte 1st Dist. Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez (PDP Laban)
As you may recall, Alvarez lost his speakership in 2018 via forcible ouster, so there were serious doubts as to whether he can regain the position, especially since many of the midterm representatives reelectionists, meaning pretty much the same ones who voted him out. 

Velasco, Cayetano, and Romualdez

The list of candidates was eventually reduced to Romualdez, Cayetano, and Velasco... and here's where things started to get messy. 

7: Congressional Mathematics
Two primary factors determine the speakership vote: 
 the general directive of each representative's political party, and,
 to a lesser extent, the preference of each representative. 
Note that the first is more important because overemphasis on the second means each congress member will vote for himself as the speaker, and thatll lead to nowhere. The House has hundreds of members, so solons prefer to vote along party lines to consolidate political power in the chamber.

Hence, the dominant party or dominant coalition usually gets the speakership.

What ""dominant party or dominant coalition""? 

PDP Laban is the dominant party with over 80 House members  so its likely to decide who becomes the next speaker which, at the time, appears to be Velasco. But 80-ish is not yet a majority in a House of over 300 members, so other parties with fewer members can band together to form a coalition that can outnumber PDP Laban.

That's what rival Romualdez did, because LAKAS has only a handful of House members .

The third hopeful, Nacionalista's Cayetano, has about 42 party-mates in the House. However, Nacionalista has a history of disunity, best evidenced by its having fielded three vice-presidential bets in 2016 (Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes, and Bongbong Marcos ), making the party look more like a hedge fund than a political force. 

These three 2016 VP Candidates (Trillanes, Cayetano, and Marcos) are from Nacionalista.

Nacionalista's tendency for intra-party factionalism strongly suggested that Cayetano, just like Romualdez, needed support from a multi-party coalition. Cayetano eventually got support from PDP Laban's 4-member Zamora Faction  and the 40-odd NUP . Cayetano has supporters, but nowhere near the number enjoyed (or claimed) by either Velasco or Romualdez.

Mid-2019 newsfeeds were filled with various solons claiming majority support for either Romualdez  or Velasco , leading many to believe that the real battle is just between them.

By late June, it appeared that Romualdez and Velasco are in the lead, with Cayetano trailing at a distant third. 

8: Cayetano threatens the Duterte Coalition
It would've just been a typical numbers game if the battle was only between Romualdez and Velasco. But Cayetano, despite having the least number of overt supporters, appeared to have been extra creative. 

In late May 2019, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte said Cayetano came to her ""with a veiled threat, that if she endorses Rep. Velasco for Speaker, he would break up the Duterte Coalition and this, he said, will affect the Presidential Elections of 2022 ."" 

Inday Sara and Alan.

Succinctly put, Cayetano threatened to destroy Duterte's political influence (the second ingredient) if Inday Sara endorses someone else.

Reinforcing that theory is Buhay Party-list Representative Lito Atienza statement in a July 2019 interview:

""That's what Congressman Cayetano has been bandying around, that he is supported by the cabinet and that in fact, the cabinet would react negatively against the president if Cayetano doesn't get his term-sharing idea ."" 


Atienza accused Cayetano of threatening Congress that the President Duterte's own cabinet will defy the Duterte if Cayetano doesn't get what he wants.

Atienza essentially said Cayetano threatened to take away the second ingredient  support from political power blocs  from the President, to weaken a cornerstone of the Duterte Presidency.

Cayetano's decision to paint himself as one of Duterte's staunchest supporters seems to have paid off, as the exodus of a staunch ally could be debilitating to Duterte, an exodus that he threatened to undertake if he doesn't become speaker. 

9: Cayetano through the years
Cayetano's threats to destroy the Duterte-led political alliance apparently weren't taken lightly, given the Cayetanos extensive history of destroying political alliances.

Cayetano entered national politics through his 2004 Taguig congressional in Taguig that was funded by that First Gentleman Juan Miguel ""Mike"" Arroyo. The relationship turned sour just two years later, after Alan accused Mike of stashing millions of dollars in a German bank account . That is, Alan ironically accused his financier of having stolen money that, two years prior, Alan could've benefitted from.

Cayetano relentlessly attacked the Arroyos for the next several years. Cayetano capitalized on his very public opposition to the unpopular Arroyos to win a senate seat in 2007 under the Nacionalista Party. He stayed in the party, supporting his sister and fellow Nacionalista Pia Cayetano's 2010 senatorial run and, by extension, the unsuccessful presidential aspirations of Nacionalista head Manny Villar.

Cayetano then joined the Liberal Party-led (LP) Team PNoy for his 2013 reelection bid. However, he bolted the alliance just two years later after LP presidentiable Mar Roxas ignored his vice-presidential  ambitions  and chose Leni Robredo for VP. 



Cayetano can't run for VP alone, so he had to find a running mate. Cayetano successfully wooed Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte, then attacked his former LP allies  during the 2016 campaign period. I guess this didnt surprise erstwhile ally Arroyo .

Judging from these, Cayetano is either  the bastion of integrity and morality, or  a political butterfly on steroids. I guess President Duterte believes it's better to be safe than sorry, so he entertained Cayetano's 2019 speakership dreams despite the distant lead of rivals Romualdez and Velasco. 

10: Why is this relevant to Duterte?
PDP Laban by itself does not constitute a House majority, but Kilusang Pagbabago does. However, that coalition has three speaker hopefuls: Romualdez, Cayetano, and Velasco. The coalition leader breaks the tie in times like these, and that coalition leader happens to be PDP Laban chairperson Rodrigo Duterte.

In the end, coalition head Duterte allowed the term-sharing deal, where Cayetano is the speaker for 15 months, Velasco for the remaining 21, and Romualdez sits as Majority Leader for the entire three years. This means a speakership change in October 2020.

As a side note, Romualdez' decision to step back is a political masterstroke because he can comfortably get and keep the relatively uncontested but potent majority leader position, while tensions simmer (and boil over) between Speaker Cayetano and his giddy and anxious successor Velasco.

True enough, Romualdez looks so chill right now as Cayetano and Velasco metaphorically stab each other in the weeks leading to the theoretical speakership transition. 

This guy is a political genius.

But instead of keeping true to his word, Cayetano refused to honor the gentleman's agreement. I would've ignored this political brawl, if not for the fact that Cayetano getting his way could result in President Duterte becoming a lame-duck president.

I do not want that. I want to protect this President's hold on power until his successor replaces him in June 2022. 

But how will the President lose significant power if Cayetano remains speaker? 

11: Duterte outside the Kulambo?
Duterte himself brokered the term-sharing agreement, which he reaffirmed in late September 2020 when he intervened in the Cayetano-Velasco catfight. Multiple news reports [33, 34, 35] indicated that President broke the impasse by declaring that Cayetano should step down on 14 October 2020. 


Every Kilusang Pagbabago Coalition member expects the decision of its leader Duterte to be followed, but it appears not to be the case. A day after the meeting, Cayetano delivered a melodramatic congressional speech and offered to resign from his post, an offer that 184 solons reportedly rejected . 

After the award-winning stunt, Velascos camp threatened to declare the speakership vacant  should Cayetano refuse to step down on the set date, thereby forcing a vote for the speakership.

If Cayetano gets his way again, what we shall witness is a brazen defiance of Duterte's leadership over Kilusang Pagbabago. Such defiance will show that Duterte has lost much support from political power blocs, support that he used to enjoy unequivocally.

Don't get me wrong: the Duterte Coalition will mostly be intact, except that it might as well change its name to the Cayetano Coalition, being that Duterte will be little more than a ceremonial head, with the Cayetano Faction calling the shots.

That is an issue. 

I supported Duterte in 2016 so he can control the government, and I do not want a political butterfly on steroids to wrest that control from him. And that's what will happen if and when Cayetano manages to remain speaker past October 14. 

Remember this?

Yes, Duterte will remain President. He will still have mass popularity. But no, he will not have full control over government anymore, because most political power blocs would instead follow Cayetano. If Cayetano fails to keep the speakership, it doesn't necessarily mean that Duterte is still in full control. But if Cayetano manages to keep it, then that loss will be certain.

I supported Duterte so he can lead this country for six full years, but if he becomes a lame duck, then that six will be reduced to four.

I do not want that. 

12: The Future of the Liberal Party after Rody
But the issue can even go beyond 2022.

As a nation, I think we have grown sick and tired of the Yellows, as evidenced by Otso Diretso's resounding defeat in the 2019 midterms. I myself do not want to witness another Quirino Hostage Crisis, another MRT Scandal , another Mamasapano Massacre , another trumped-up Corona impeachment case , another Kidapawan Carnage , another tsunami of drug syndicates , another botched Yolanda rehab.

Even the Liberal Party is painfully aware that its chances in 2022 are slim.

But the survival instinct is inherent in any human organization. In the absence of a winnable presidentiable, the Liberal Party will do the next best thing: support a friendly and winnable non-ally, hoping that it will catalyze the dying party's political resurrection. 

As of this article's writing, potentially winnable candidates for 2022 are:
 Manila mayor Isko Moreno,

 Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte,

 Former senator Bongbong Marcos,

 Senator Bong Go, and,

 Senator Manny Pacquiao

 Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.
Multiple reliable sources say first-term mayor Moreno will likely opt for reelection and I seriously think he will because it's the path of least resistance. 

Duterte, Go, and Pacquiao are too Duterte-aligned to accommodate LP. 

Meanwhile, Marcos is LP's archnemesis, so that's a no go.

In short, LP's last hope is its former ally Cayetano. 

No replay, please.

Cayetano ditched Arroyo right before the 2007 elections. Cayetano ditched Aquino for the 2016 elections. If Cayetano manages to prove that he can defy Duterte, if he sees that he can independently exist in the political ecosystem, what will he do in 2022?",RJ Nieto,"October 6, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/10/duterte-hope-liberal-party.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Cebu City's #COVID19 Crisis: A throbbing migraine for General Cimatu,"Latest data shows Cebu City has 3,987 cases  against a total population of 922,961 , translating to 4,320 cases per million residents, i.e., between Italys 3,948  and the UKs 4,511 .

Oddly, Cebu City registered 64 total deaths , translating to just 69 deaths per million, way below Italys 573  and UKs 632 .

If there are about as many cases per capita in Cebu City as in Italy and the UK, why is Cebu Citys mortality rate drastically lower than the two?

A potential explanation would be underreporting (e.g., COVID deaths reported as just pneumonia deaths), but the disparity between Cebu City and Italy/UK is just so vast, underreporting alone wont be enough to explain this phenomenon.

A possible additional explanation is that Filipinos are generally younger.

People age 65 years and up at significantly higher risk of mortality for COVID-19  while the median age is 24.1 years  for Filipinos versus Italys 46.5  and the UKs 40.6 . That is, Filipinos stricken with COVID-19 generally have more resilient bodies.

Note, however, that a young population is not necessarily a good thing.


Filipinos on the average live for 70 years , compared to Italys 82.5  and the UKs 81.1 , meaning Filipinos die over a decade earlier than Italians and Brits. Thus, its also possible that Cebu City has fewer COVID-19 DPM because many of Cebus elderly, who would have been at higher risk of dying from COVID-19, have already died over a decade ago from some other cause.

Moreover, the Philippine Healthcare System as a whole is indubitably inferior to Italy and the UK. Case in point, Cebu City ran out of hospital beds to accommodate COVID-19 cases on 11 June 2020 . While DOH Cebu City requisitioned additional beds, the fact remains that its medical workforce remains the same, potentially translating to a generally lower quality of care, as doctors and nurses divide their attention among more patients.


Regardless, I think its reasonable to expect Cebu Citys DPM to remain relatively low and nowhere near those of the UK and Italy, which the Health Department uses to claim the effectiveness of its COVID-19 response.

And thats a major problem because it doesnt take into account that Cebu Citys recovery rate, along with the rest of the Philippines, is shockingly low.

However, a slightly closer look at the numbers reveals a bad sign: the recovery rate is too low.

The median length of hospital stay for COVID-19 patients outside of China is 4 to 21 days . Generously assuming a 21-day hospital stay, Cebu Citys a vast majority 2,319 cases as of 01 June 2020  should have already recovered 21 days later on 22 June 2020.

However, data shows only 278 recoveries out of Cebu Citys 3,987 cases, meaning Cebu Citys COVID patients remain very sick longer than other countries. These patients are likely to survive, but extended hospital stays imply more massive medical bills.


Such bills will be a burden for Filipinos because the Philippines has yet to fully implement Universal Healthcare , unlike Italy and the UK, that already have such systems in place since 1978  and 1948 , respectively.

All in all, I think its safe to say that Cebuanos have a higher chance of survival compared to those in Italy and the UK. However, survivors may want to brace themselves for years or even decades of misery because theyre more likely to face massive medical debt as a result of their hospitalization.

Given the sheer number of COVID-19 cases in Cebu, this dark reality may significantly affect the level of support among Cebuanos for this administration, so the pressure is on newly-appointed IATF-Cebu head and former Armed Forces Chief of Staff Roy Cimatu  to salvage the situation.",RJ Nieto,"June 24, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/cebu-city-covid19-crisis-will-be.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
A short summary of the RTC decision on Maria Ressa's online libel case,"Here is a concise summary of Manila RTC Branch 46 presiding judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesas 37-page decision on People v. Maria Ressa et al., docketed as Criminal Case No. R-MNL-19-01141-CR for violation of Section 4(c) of R.A. 10175 (Online Libel).


FOR THE PROSECUTION:
RAPPLERS REYNALDO SANTOS in the 01 February 2014 Rappler article C.J. using SUVs of Controversial Businessman, accused BUSINESSMAN WILFREDO KENG of involvement in Human Trafficking, Drug Trafficking, Smuggling, Tax Evasion, and Murder.
People of the Philippines v. Santos, Ressa, and Rappler by ThinkingPinoy on Scribd


Keng tried to negotiate with RAPPLERS MARITES VITUG to publish a clarification or retraction, and Vitug assigned RAPPLERS KATERINA SABELINA FRANCISCO to write the article. Keng showed Rappler a PDEA certificate showing drug allegations are false, and Law Enforcement didnt even find enough justification to initiate an investigation on the murder, human trafficking, smuggling, tax evasion, and murder allegations.

Keng repeatedly followed-up with Rappler for seven months, but no article was published.

Rapplers Francisco seconded Kengs claims when she testified that she drafted a clarificatory story and submitted it to Rapplers editors, but it was never published.

Rappler did not only refuse to publish Franciscos follow-up article, but also refused to take down Santos article, leading Keng to file libel charges against Santos, RAPPLER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF MARIA RESSA, and RAPPLER CHAIRMAN BENJAMIN BITANGA.

FOR THE DEFENSE:
RAPPLER FOUNDER MA. ROSARIO CHAI F. HOFILEA testified that Rappler has a pool of several editors that reviews stories before theyre published. Hofilea said Ressa is the CEO and Executive Editor, whose job is to oversee the entire organization and worry about its financials.

Hofilea said Ressa isnt involved in Rapplers day-to-day operations. She further explained that Ressas Executive Editor position isnt equivalent to editor-in-chief in the newspaper and that Rappler has no editor-in-chief.

Hofilea explained that Ressa would typically consult with the other editors if an article involves a controversial story, and editors collectively decide what to do about it. Hofilea, however, said if theres a stalemate, Ressa breaks the tie.

The defense also showed a legal opinion from the NBI indicating that the offense has prescribed, i.e., Keng filed a libel case beyond the 1-year limit.

The defense decided against presenting Ressa and Santos.

SUMMARY OF COURT RULING:
An online libel conviction can be had if prosecution shows five  elements of online libel are present, namely:  defamatory statement,  publication,  identification,  done online, and  malice.


The first four elements can easily be shown with a glance at Reynaldo Santos 01 February 2014 Rappler article C.J. using SUVs of Controversial Businessman, and the main point of contention in this case is the fifth element, i.e. Malice.

ON MALICE
Malice per Yuchengco v. Manila Chronicle  is ill will or spite and speaks not in response to duty but merely to injure the reputation of the person defamed, and implies an intention to do ulterior and unjustifiable harm.

The Supreme Court in Disini v. SOJ  presumes malice if complainant is a private individual, and Wilfredo Keng is such.

But RTC went a step further when it ruled that actual malice, which Vasquez v. C.A. defined as knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not, is present in this case.

The RTC said:
Santos wrote the xxx article sans verification xxx. The article imputes various crimes upon xxx Keng which was sufficiently proven during trial to be untrue. xxx This utter lack of verification is contrary to the (journalistic) standard maintained by Rappler, as testified by Hofilea xxx.
The RTC said both Santos and Ressa were aware of the probable falsity of their claims, as Keng has already pointed out the inaccuracies and even provided Rappler with a PDEA certification. Despite this, both Santos and Ressa didnt publish the clarificatory article and allowed the libelous article to remain on the website.

The RTC said:
Any news organization who claims to adhere to accuracy, fairness, and balance in terms of reporting, would have retracted, or xxx, issued a clarificatory article if there have been some indications of falsity to its previous article. Both accused, however, did not.
ON PRESCRIPTION
Using an NBI legal opinion, Ressa argued that the lawsuit has prescribed, i.e., Keng sued after the time limit (one year after publication) was over.

RTC, however, rejected the NBI opinion because its just an internal NBI memorandum that does not bear weight in this case, as it is not relevant and does not bind the Court.

RTC, citing Panaguiton v. DOJ , said Act No. 3326  applies to the special law on Online Libel (R.A. 10175 Sec 4(c)), as it explained that online Libel carries a penalty of at least four years imprisonment, so the prescription period is 12 years.

ON LIABILITY OF RESSA AND SANTOS
RTC, citing RPC Art 360 , said both the author and editor or business manager are liable, adding that the editor or business managers duty to know and control the contents of the paper.

Hofilea claims Ressa is Rappler's CEO and Executive Editor but not an editor-in-chief. Still, RTC noted that Hofilea admitted that Ressa makes the ultimate decision during deadlocks, i.e., Ressa controls and approves Rapplers content.

RTC noted that per RPC Art 361 , a defendant should be acquitted if libelous statement is true and was published with good motives and for justifiable ends but neither Santos nor Ressa appeared to prove that ground for acquittal.

The silence of the accused should not be taken against him but per People v. Resano, a prima facie case from the prosecution, as is the case here, may warrant the accused to take the stand to refute the case, but neither Ressa nor Santos did.

RTC then ruled:
Judgement is hereby rendered finding accused Reynaldo Santos Jr and Maria Angelita Ressa GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt xxx and are each xxx sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from 6 months and 1 day xxx to six years xxx.",RJ Nieto,"June 16, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/people-vs-ressa-short-summary-of-37.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#JunkTerrorBill: Fake Facebook Accounts linked to Fake Death Threat?,"University of the Philippines Los Banos student organization Defend UPLB announced on 07 June 2020  that it took down one of its posts after it supposedly launched an investigation on the matter. It was referring to an earlier post claiming that a #JunkTerrorBill protester received a death threat from an unidentified number, a screenshot of which can be seen below:


As we all know, the post above was used to justify claims of various camps that the Duterte Administration or its allies are threatening members of the opposition.

But a little sleuthing reveals that there's something really fishy going on.

A day later on 08 June 2020, Defend UPLB said :
Defend UPLB categorically denies any allegations of manufacturing death threats. We received the report from one of our volunteers and urgently released an alert as our standard procedure. However, we admit that there was lack of oversight on our part to vet the reports.
An Inquirer article dated 04 June 2020 describes DefendUPLB as a student alliance , so I do not understand how it would discriminate between ""allies"" and mere ""volunteers."" While I commend the organization for launching an investigation into the matter, I just find it odd that the organization's members appeared to have immediately disowned that ""volunteer"" when he, in fact, is a part of it.

In the same 08 June 2020 statement, Defend UPLB included a link to the ""Volunteer's Personal Statement "", which leads to a post by UPLB student Ray Silvestre Binas explaining his side of the story.



Here are some of Binas' significant claims in the lengthy personal statement:
Binas claims to have received an anonymous SMS threat from a number.
He disposed of some unneeded personal stuff on 26 April 2020, and his sister asked him, on that same day, if he'd like to dump his phone.
He agreed without realizing that the phone had the SIM for the Defend UPLB hotline.
The SIM Card hasn't received any calls or messages from anyone.
He hasn't loaded credits on his phone for a long time because it's his alternate SIM.
He claims that around 10 AM of 07 June 2020, he ""received a text message saying ""mamatay ka na"" received a text message saying 'mamatay ka na.'""
He said he was ""paralyzed with fear until the group chat of the Defend UPLB popped out on my notifications, and I cannot think of anything else but to report this matter to them.""
He said, ""someone from [his] alliance noticed that the exact phone number used to threaten me was the CRW hotline number last March.
The ""personal statement"" includes five photos:


1:A screenshot of the alleged SMS death threat from +639351220364, with time stamp 10:42 AM, 07 June 2020


2: A screenshot of an allegedly fake Facebook account with the name ""Binas Ray.""




3: A screenshot of Facebook image post of his supposed decluttering, which clearly shows ""26 April"".



4: Another screenshot of a 26 April 2020 Facebook image post of his supposed decluttering.

5: A screenshot of a random online article on how to clone phone numbers.



Fact-checking Binas
Binas claims he cleaned his flat on 26 April 2020, and only after then did he decide to dump the old phone, including the SIM card for Defend UPLB's hotline.

Defend UPLB has been using that number for its hotline no later than 16 March 2020, or when it announced  its Citizen Rights Watch project on Facebook, as shown below:


Given this, why would Defend UPLB allow who it considers as a mere ""volunteer""  and a college freshman at that  to handle a hotline that deals with such sensitive and dangerous topics?

Defend UPLB is arguably a high-profile organization after being featured multiple times in news outlets like Inquirer , Interaksyon , Bandera . The organization has also been featured in Rappler almost every month since 2014 .

Page after page of Rappler articles featuring Defend UPLB, with one published in 2014.
Such a high-profile organization with at least 6 years of experience would know better than to let an inexperienced volunteer handle such a critical task, right?

Moreover, considering that Defend UPLB has been in the news since 2014 and it repeatedly advertised the number on 17 March 2020 , 22 April 2020 , what are the odds that it hasn't received any SMS or calls for over a month, especially if the hotline is for reports involving harassment from the government?

Cloned SIM Card?
Recall that Binas claims somebody cloned his SIM and texted him using that cloned number.

But if Binas really did throw his phone and SIM into the trash, why would anybody bother to clone his number when one can just pick up the SIM and use it right away?

There's COVID-19 epidemic, so why would anybody go to the junkshop and expose himself to toxic waste just to get a SIM card when he can just buy a brand new one for next to nothing?

Is Binas, who Defend UPLB describes as just a ""volunteer,"" so outstanding that somebody with very sophisticated electronics skills will bother spoofing him?

If Binas mistakenly threw the phone and SIM away on 26 April 2020, why would Defend UPLB still advertise the number on 28 April 2020  and 01 May 2020 ?

Most importantly, Defend UPLB even advertised the same number on 02 June 2020  for registration of participants in its 04 June 2020 conference entitled ""Ensuring Campus Safety under the Anti-terrorism Bill,"" an event that apparently pushed through .
By dignifying Binas' personal statement, is Defend UPLB suggesting that the conference pushed through without them checking if anybody registered by contacting that hotline? Suppose Defend UPLB knew of the SIM card's loss, why didn't they announce it?

Are Binas and Defend UPLB basically saying that ""the dog ate their homework""?


Whichever way it goes, it appears that Binas and Defend UPLB are lying.


Data suggest that Binas received the SMS death threat from somebody in charge of Defend UPLB's hotline and that somebody could be Binas or one of his pals in the organization.

The Fake Facebook Accounts
On 07 June 2020, thousands of fake Facebook accounts popped up overnight, mostly spoofing names of Filipino university students, faculty, and alumni .

Note that the fake accounts aren't fully-populated profiles: no photos, no posts, no friends' list, and they contain only the name of the person impersonated, and most of the victims are students or school employees.

Like this.

Again, we know two things:
The fake accounts typically contain only a name and nothing else.
Most of the victims are connected to universities.
Hold on to that thought for now.

Defend UPLB is the same organization that started the Change.Org petition  entitled ""JUNK THE ANTI-TERRORISM BILL AND UPHOLD HUMAN RIGHTS!"", which garnered almost 800,000 signatures as of 08 June 2020.



Change.Org, where the petition is located, allows a petition's starter to download the list of all those who signed the petition, either in PDF or Excel format, as shown below:


The resulting list contains the signatory's name, location, and the date he signed the petition. The location may sometimes include the signatory's city or just the signatory's country. Suffice it to say, the only useful field there is the one containing the names.

Isn't it too coincidental that the Change.org petitions have nothing but the names, just like the fake Facebook accounts that everybody's been complaining about?


Isn't it too coincidental that Defend UPLB's primary audience is university students and faculty, and the majority of the fake Facebook accounts contain names of people from that same community?

And most importantly, which among these possibilities is most likely:
Somebody hacked a database other than the signatories list in Change.org, and that database coincidentally also focuses on schools, and the names were used to create the fake accounts;
Somebody hacked the database of this Change.org petition, and the names were used to create the fake accounts;
Defend UPLB, who already has access to the list of names, used the names to create the fake accounts
Well, Occam's Razor suggests that all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one.

I see the perfect opportunity for agitprop, the weapon of choice of many left-wing groups.

There is much ready-to-use software out there that can automatically create fake Facebook accounts using a database of real names. I won't teach you how to do that in this article, so I won't get into trouble.

The Weird Timestamps
Interestingly, Binas edited his personal statement on Facebook 13 times in about five hours.
His edits have the following timestamps:
3:59 PM  Original Post
4:01 PM  1st edit
4:01 PM  2nd edit
4:02 PM  3rd edit
4:03 PM  4th edit
4:04 PM  5th edit
4:06 PM  6th edit
4:11 PM  7th edit
4:17 PM  8th edit
4:22 PM  9th edit
4:22 PM  10th edit
5:13 PM  11th edit
6:56 PM  12th edit
8:38 PM  13th edit

Defend UPLB's post  that links to Binas' personal statement has a timestamp of 4:05.

Timestamps of the first six versions of Binas' personal statement, he edited his personal statement every minute (3:59 PM, 4:01 PM, 4:01, 4:02 PM, 4:03 PM, 4:04 PM), then the seventh edit is at 4:06. Nothing happened at 4:05, which is the exact time that Defend UPLB shared Binas' personal statement.


Given this, which among the following is most likely:
Binas, the inexperienced freshman, is also the administrator of Defend UPLB's Facebook Page;
Defend UPLB almost instantaneously shared Binas' personal statement after the latter published it;
Binas and Defend UPLB helped each other in crafting Binas' personal statement; or,
The 4:05 PM blip is purely coincidental
What's more interesting, however, is the 13th edit.

The original post until the 12th edit contains the sentence:
My family is already seeking the help of the authorities like the NBI and the network operator, which is TM to resolve this matter.
Then four hours later, Binas changed that sentence into:
My family is already seeking the help of the right authorities and the network operator, which is TM to resolve this matter.
Why did Binas decide to remove the phrase ""like the NBI,"" when the NBI should be the first authority he should consult? Does he intend to avoid the NBI at all costs? If so, why?

NBI, can you invite Binas and Defend UPLB's officers? You guys may want to ask them more than a few questions.",RJ Nieto,"June 9, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/06/junkterrorbill-fake-facebook-accounts.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
NCR to GCQ with Duque: Data shows Duterte between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,"Did the Philippines make the right decision when it eased the lockdown on NCR, the country's coronavirus epicenter?

On 1 June 2020, the Philippines decided to relax lockdown measures in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the countrys COVID-19 epidemic. Public opinion on this decision is mixed. Some say its too early as the coronavirus is still beyond the governments control, while others say the government has successfully flattened the curve.

In this article, we will examine the wisdom of this decision (or the lack of it), by comparing the Philippines to other countries that have significantly relaxed their lockdown measures and how the number of daily active cases changed afterward.

To further explain this papers methodology, let me start by discussing the rationale behind a COVID-19 lockdown.

The spread of disease starts when the first infected individual (Patient Zero) enters a country and gets into contact with its erstwhile COVID-free population. The spread begins slowly at first because still few are contagious. However, the spread accelerates as more people become carriers, and the total number of infected individuals increases exponentially, generally following a logistic growth curve.

COVID-19 will not have been much of an issue if a tried-and-tested antiviral is available. However, its not the case, as vaccines and other pharmaceutical interventions are still in highly experimental stages.

If a scantily understood but contagious disease like COVID-19 is allowed to spread unabated, theres a high likelihood that the number of infected will overwhelm a countrys healthcare system. And when demand breaches supply, mortality rates rise. After all, a COVID-19 victim is far less likely to survive without medical attention.

Flattening the Curve, Raising the Line
By this time, most people are already aware of Flattening the curve, a public health strategy focused on slowing the spread of disease to keep healthcare demand within the capacity of a countrys healthcare system.

Usually, flatten the curve involves pharmaceutical interventions that mitigate or eliminate the disease. But COVID-19 antivirals are unavailable right now, so governments resort to non-pharmaceutical interventions that focus mainly on vector control, or restricting contact between persons, thereby reducing the likelihood of coronavirus transmission.


That is, governments focus on prevention since there is no cure yet.


COVID-19 vector control measures include (a) closing down of schools, (b) isolation of the elderly and those with co-morbidities, (c) self-quarantine of suspected and confirmed cases, (d) social distancing, and in extreme cases, (e) a lockdown, i.e., the forcible home quarantine of a vast majority of the population.

Complementing Flattening the Curve is Raising the Line, where the line represents the countrys healthcare capacity.

Raising the line includes increasing the number of hospital beds, medical personnel, and medical equipment. For example:
The Philippine Government has converted various public buildings into ad hoc COVID-19 treatment facilities, thus increasing the number of hospital beds.
Philippine Senator Bong Go, on the other hand, seeks the creation of a Medical Reserve Corps, aimed at increasing the number of medical personnel.
The #PPEniTP Project, a partnership between Thinking Pinoy and the Filipino-Chinese Community, provides essential personal protective equipment (PPE) to COVID-19 frontliners, helping make medical equipment more available.
Of course, limitations on resources mean The Line cannot be Raised indefinitely, so most governments put a greater emphasis on flattening the curve, hence the lockdowns.


Oxfords Government Response Stringency Index
Most countries enforce some form of lockdown, but the severity of such policies varies widely, making it challenging to compare performance data between two different jurisdictions.

To address this, the University of Oxfords Blavatnik School of Government created the COVID-19: Government Response Stringency Index, which the website defines as:

The Government Response Stringency Index is a composite measure based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest response).

More specifically, the index is based mainly on nine policy and response categories, namely:
School closures
Workplace closures
Canceling public events
Restrictions on gatherings
Public transport closures
Public information campaigns
Stay at home
Restrictions on internal movement
International travel controls
Take, for example, the index for the United Kingdom, as shown below:


As can be seen above, the UK started to enforce drastically stringent policies until 23 March 2020, which coincides with when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the country under a virtual lockdown.

From the same graph, we can also see a significant relaxation on 13 May 2020, which coincides with the easing of the UK lockdown as data shows economy (was) hit.

Focusing on the Philippines
Now, lets look at the Philippines:


President Duterte declared a Luzon-wide lockdown in mid-March, which explains the rise in Stringency in the graph. A sudden drop in Stringency occurred on 01 May 2020, or when it started enforcing a General Community Quarantine (GCQ) in select parts of the country.

The graph shows lockdown policies are still pretty strict for the Philippines, but Stringency will drop drastically as Metro Manila and Central Luzon transitioned to GCQ on 01 June 2020.

Significant Policy Relaxation
High Stringency flattens the curve, but when applied for too long, it also flattens the economy.

Of course, no government wants its people to survive from COVID-19 just to let them die from hunger. Hence, governments change Stringency to balance Public Health and Economics. Such changes affect the rate of spread of disease. The bigger the change in policy, the bigger the difference in the rate of spread of disease.

The Philippines, as explained previously, has enforced its second significant policy relaxation on 01 June 2020 when it let Metro Manila transition to GCQ.

Was this the right thing to do? Thats the question.

Of course, there are many ways to define a significant policy relaxation based on the Stringency Index. But for this article, we shall set it as the date where the Stringency decreased by 9 points or more from its highest peak. A more optimal value may be found, but 9 points suggest at least one minor relaxation in each of the nine indicators or a significant easing in one or more.

More formally stated:

Let S be the Stringency at date x. We define peak date P as the latest date at which S is at its maximum, i.e.:
P := maximum { d | S (d) = maximum {S} }.
Further, we define significant relaxation date R as the earliest date after P where S decreased by more than 9 (S > 9), i.e.:
R := minimum { d | S(p) - S(d) > 9; d > p}.
That is, a Significant Policy Relaxation happens on date R.
Many countries have yet to significantly relax policies so that their Rs may not exist, but we are just concerned with those that have already done so. Using data from Oxfords Stringency Index, the table below lists down countries that have significantly relaxed policies (S > 9).


The Philippines is not the first country to significantly relax policies, as the table above shows 14 others who have done so in the past, but did the Philippine make the right decision to follow suit?

Active COVID-19 Cases
Recall that flattening the curve and raising the line are both aimed at keeping the total healthcare demand within the limits of a countrys healthcare system, but how do we get an idea of aggregate demand?

In an interview, infectious disease specialist Dr. Edsel Salvana of the UP Manila National Institute of Health used doubling time as a gauge, which he defines as the number of days it takes for the cumulative COVID-19 cases to double.

Doubling time is a very reasonable indicator of aggregate healthcare demand. Still, this metric is essentially the first derivative of the epidemic growth curve, making it less readily correlatable to healthcare demand.

As an alternative, this article uses total current active COVID-19 cases, as it arguably directly correlates with a countrys aggregate healthcare demand. After all, a fully recovered COVID-19 case likely wont need much medical attention.

In this light, here are histographs of active cases of each of 15 countries with significantly relaxed policies, as listed in the previous section.

Data for active cases come from the Worldometers Coronavirus Tracker. The histograph titles contain the name of the country and the date of significant policy relaxation R, with red vertical lines denoting Rs approximate location.




Based on these histographs, active cases in 12 out of 15 countries with significant policy relaxations have fallen or plateaued. The three remaining countries  the Philippines, Indonesia, and Pakistan  have significantly relaxed policies despite respectively experiencing a continuous rise in active cases.

The Philippine Dilemma
Exacerbating the Philippine Pandemic is the accelerated growth in active cases over the past several days. The Philippine Health Department said the spike is attributable to late reporting, but the fact remains that total active cases undeniably continue to rise.

And this is a problem.

Continuously rising active cases mean its just a matter of time before demand breaches healthcare capacity. If and when that happens, mortality rates increase as COVID patients spill on the streets.

The Philippines has arguably slowed down the spread of COVID-19 through Stringency measures, but the more important question is whether it has restricted it enough.

It appears that it didnt. Worse, data suggest that the rise is accelerating.

Given that the curve didnt flatten enough, the remaining option is to raise the line.

That is, given the failure to sufficiently control healthcare demand, the government will have no other recourse but to increase healthcare capacity. But it is uncertain as to how long the government can sustain this, as it will only manage to strain the countrys already strained resources further.

Case in point, the national budget has been realigned to the nations COVID-19 response.

Raising the Line, but not that much
While the Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the Public Works Department are doing an excellent job building new COVID-19 facilities, the fact remains that the country has nowhere to get more medical personnel and equipment.

Worse, the countrys medical workforce is shrinking, as evidenced by the Philippines coronavirus infection rate among healthcare workers.

Abdi Mahamud, the World Health Organizations COVID-19 incident manager for the Western Pacific Region, said health workers comprise as many as 13% of cases in the Philippines, which he attributed to the PPE shortage and levels of coronavirus exposure.

Even at the onset of the pandemic, most Philippine hospitals already lack not only doctors and nurses but also PPEs, so just imagine how much worse it will be as the number of active cases rise further.
Three basic options

There are three primary courses of action left for the government:
Lower Stringency: further relax policies
Maintain Stringency: continue with the status quo
Raise Stringency: reinstate the lockdown
The first option is obviously off the table for the time being, so lets skip to the second.

As explained in previous sections, maintaining the significantly relaxed policies post-May will ultimately result in higher mortality rates.

A vast majority of COVID-19 patients will recover, and the nation will ultimately still survive. However, (a) a large number will likely die, a number that many Filipinos will likely perceive as unnecessarily larger due to lack of healthcare, and; (b) many of those who will triumph over the sickness will inevitably undergo torturous near-death experiences, which they will likely blame on the government.

The Health Department can try to hide cases as it did during the Dengvaxia Fiasco, but hiding bodies, given the far greater magnitude of the COVID-19 epidemic compared to the 2017 Scandal, will be an impossible task.

And when people see bodies pile up, people get angry.

President Duterte may manage to at least partially assuage unrest by terminating Health Secretary Francisco Duque. Still, he remains reluctant despite massive clamor from both sides of the political fence, the healthcare community, and the general public.

That is, maintaining the relaxed status quo will likely result in a political nightmare for the Duterte Administration and whoever it will anoint as a successor.

Meanwhile, the third and last option  reinstating the lockdown  may save lives but ultimately cause economic devastation and, subsequently, massive civil unrest as the masses starve.

The President is between the devil and the deep blue sea, and the Filipino People fervently wish him success, which is more easily achievable if his Chief Public Health adviser Duque has competence, which unfortunately isnt the case.

#DrilonOnCNN: A case for firing fact-checker Vera Files,"Vera Files' latest fact-checking stunt on the issue of Senator Franklin Drilon's CNN interview should be a ground for its expulsion from its ""fact-checker""-ship.
Vera Files is among Facebooks fact-checkers in the Philippines, and I checked how it became so.

Facebook in its official help page  said it work(s) with third-party fact-checkers who are certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) to help identify and review false news, a claim seconded by Poynter Institute with a related announcement.

Given these, I can only deduce that some Facebook chose fact-checkers from the roster of IFCN members.

But what are the requirements for IFCN membership?

Quoting IFCNs Code of Principles, each member needs to commit to several things, including (a) Transparency of Sources, (b) Nonpartisanship and fairness, and (c) Transparency of Funding.

Vera Files is an IFCN member, and this article, without prejudice to possible legal action against Vera Files, will discuss why it shouldnt remain so.

VERA FILES AND DRILON'S CNN INTERVIEW
Vera Files 07 March 2020 article VERA FILES FACT CHECK: Jay Sonza, RJ Nieto help propagate wrong claim that Drilon snoozed in CNN PH interview starts with:
Former broadcaster Jay Sonza and blogger RJ Nieto, both known for their pro-administration stance, amplified a false claim that Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon snoozed in the middle of a television interview.
Vera Files used blogger to describe this articles writer, RJ Nieto, conveniently omitting that hes also a journalist through his daily political commentary radio show Karambola sa DWIZ and the weekly column Thinking Pinoy at the major broadsheet Manila Bulletin. Moreover, Vera Files described both as pro-administration, which is irrelevant to the question of whether Senator Franklin Drilon snoozed or not.

Vera Files must be aware of these omissions because (a) Vera Files in the same article fact-checked a video posted on the Thinking Pinoy Facebook page, whose logo since September 2019 includes superimposed miniaturized logos of DWIZ 882 AM and Manila Bulletin; and (b) Vera Files in its fact-checks supposedly adheres to the Philippine Press Institutes Code of Ethics, part of which states:
I shall scrupulously report and interpret the news, taking care not to suppress essential facts nor to distort the truth by omission or improper emphasis.
This is a blatant attempt of Vera Files to poison the well as they consciously offer irrelevant adverse information and, at the same time, omit material facts about the person theyre fact-checking.

Here's Thinking Pinoy's logo that it has been using since September 2019:


Heres a question:
If a rabid opposition supporter shoots me in the head after reading this Vera Files article, will my being a newspaper columnist and radio broadcaster make my death count as a journalist killing?
The same assailed article then went on to claim that:
Sonza and Nieto both have a history of purveying misleading information on social media.
In the fact check article, Vera Files hyperlinked the phrase purveying misleading information to another Vera Files article , strongly suggesting that the claim against Nieto is supported by the said link.

A look at the links target, however, shows that its a 14 November 2018 fact check about Sonza and Sonza alone. That is, Vera Files claim that Nieto has a history of purveying misleading information on social media is not just an extraordinarily heavy allegation, but also an allegation that is failed to be supported by facts.

Fact-checking Nieto
Vera Files, in the assailed article, directed the readers attention to the 02 March 2020 Thinking Pinoy Facebook Live Video entitled FACT CHECK: DID SENATOR DRILON FALL ASLEEP IN A CNN PHILIPPINES INTERVIEW?, where it quoted:
Nakatulog siya momentarily, mga a span of five, ten seconds. Ngayon, medyo nakakahiya nga yon. Pero feeling ko, ano yan, may sakit si Drilon. Baka, ano, narcoleptic, ewan ko. Medyo hindi normal yon eh, kasi, immediately before atsaka immediately after nung pagtulog niya, dilat na dilat naman siya. Pero kahit na, nakakahiya pa rin.
(He fell asleep momentarily, for a span of five, ten seconds. Now, thats indeed kind of embarrassing. But I feel like, Drilon is sick. Maybe narcoleptic, I dont know. What happened is not normal, because immediately before and after he dozed off, his eyes were wide open. Nevertheless, that is still embarrassing.)
Nieto uttered these words at the 2:55 mark, as shown in the link below:


https://www.facebook.com/TheThinkingPinoy/videos/3401184933231084/?t=175

Vera Files, however, conveniently omitted what Nieto said at the 4:18 mark, which was:
So ang tanong, Nakatulog ba si Drilon o hindi? Well, judging from the video ng CNN mismo, mukha ngang nakatulog.
(So the question Did Drilon fall asleep or not? Well, judging from the CNN video itself, he really looks like he fell asleep.)
Check this via the link below:

https://www.facebook.com/TheThinkingPinoy/videos/3401184933231084/?t=258

Nieto was referring to timestamp 11:55 of Drilons CNN interview, as shown below:


Now, does that look like hes fully awake the entire time? How would an average reasonable person interpret what he saw? Is it false to say that Drilon looked like he was sleeping when his head was bowed down for an inordinate amount of time?

Additionally, Vera Files all-too-conveniently omitted the readily observable fact that CNN host Pinky Webb laughed momentarily during those moments and even decided to repeat the question to Drilon.

Quoting what Webb said, verbatim, during the same time Drilon supposedly fell asleep:
(Webb, staring at the void) There is a joint resolution, aside from the letter that was signed by Congressman Alvarez and House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano (Webb shifts gaze to Drilon, momentarily giggles and smiles, then raises her voice) Joint Resolution, which I already asked your chief of staff, sir (giggles, squirms) Theres a joint resolution, theres a concurrent resolution youve sub youve authored both
Webb, who rarely stutters, had to stutteringly repeat the question to Drilon, especially the parts said while Drilon was bowing down. Drilon is one of the most intelligent senators out there, so why would Webb feel the need to repeat the question if Drilon was fully lucid?

In this interview, Webb maintained a congenial tone, but she never definitively smiled. That is, until the 11:55 mark when she saw Drilon bowing down.

A VERY CONVENIENT OMISSION
Vera Files then went on to say:
Drilon did not fall asleep at any time during the interview.
VERA Files obtained from CNN Philippines a screen grab of the clip without the character generator (chargen) -- the graphics placed on the bottom portion of videos -- that shows Drilon not sleeping, but looking at the documents on the table in front of him.
Vera Files included this graphic that includes a snapshot from raw footage, which is not publicly available until Vera Files published it.

Vera Files' logic is problematic on at least two grounds:

[a] Vera Files expects Nieto to see the invisible, as CNN Philippines live broadcasts contain character generator graphics overlays, and theres no way to see whats behind them.

[b] Vera Files basis for claiming Nieto propagated a falsehood relies on a false premise, as Nieto clearly qualified the limitation of his observation. Specifically, Nieto said he based it on what he saw in the live video (which has overlays), and not the raw video used as a basis by Vera Files.


Vera Files then attempted to buttress its observation by quoting Webb as having tweeted:
Heres what happened. As I was laying the premise for my question, I saw Sen Drilon look down at the documents he had on the table. I did not see him fall asleep.
If all Webb saw was Drilon looking at documents, then why would she have to  giggle,  raise her voice,  repeat the question,  giggle again, and  squirm?


Moreover, does the presence of documents in front of Drilon make it impossible for him to fall asleep?

IFCN MEMBERSHIP STANDARDS
Recall that IFCNs Code of Principles requires Vera Files to commit to (a) Transparency of Sources, (b) Nonpartisanship and fairness, and (c) Transparency of Funding.

To ensure compliance, IFCN requires Vera Files to re-apply for membership yearly by answering a questionnaire, so lets fact-check Vera Files answers in its 2019 IFCN application form.

Lets fact-check the parts relevant to the Drilon Issue.

IFCN CRITERION 3A: SOURCES POLICY
The question under Criterion 3a: Sources Policy reads:
Please share a brief and public explanation (500 words max) of how sources are provided in enough detail that readers could replicate the fact check. If you have a public policy on how you find and use sources for your fact-checking, it should be shared here.
Vera Files answer includes, among other things:

FIRST, Vera Files said, Hyperlinks to resources used its fact checks are provided within the text, and that, VERA Files follows a three-source policy for news reports and clearly states that at least three media networks used the same quote, or reported the event or incident.

This claim is false, as the sentence Sonza and Nieto both have a history of purveying misleading information on social media, does not have a reference to support Nietos alleged history of purveying misleading information.

SECOND, Vera files said its policy on sources is found in What you want to know about VERA Files Fact Check, and that article states:

[a] In the spirit of transparency, we provide the links to the sources of the statement and the evidence that are presented in the article.
Vera Files failed to do this, as explained earlier.
[b] As a news media organization, we strictly adhere to the professional and ethical standards set for journalists such as those found in the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and the Philippine Journalists Code of Ethics (PPI)

The SPJ Code of Ethics includes the following:


 Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing, or summarizing a story.
It has been shown in the previous sections that the assailed fact-check article oversimplified and misrepresented the story when it willfully omitted crucial details in the CNN interview and Nietos Thinking Pinoy video, while including unsupported, irrelevant, and libelous claims about Nietos character.
 Diligently seek subjects of news coverage to allow them to respond to criticism or allegations of wrongdoing.
Vera Files never contacted yours truly.
 Provide access to source material when it is relevant and appropriate.
See [a].
 Avoid stereotyping. Journalists should examine the ways their values and experiences may shape their reporting.
Vera Files stereotyped Nieto as pro-Administration, despite the fact that Nieto very frequently and quite harshly criticizes Administration-aligned figures, including Information Technology Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, Health Secretary Francisco Duque, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, and Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy,  to name a few.

IFCN CRITERION 2B: NONPARTISANSHIP POLICY
The question under Criterion 2b: Nonpartisanship policy reads:
Evidence required: Please share evidence of your policy preventing staff from direct involvement in political parties and advocacy organizations. Please also indicate the policy your organization has as a whole regarding advocacy and supporting political candidates.
The response? VERA Files nonpartisan policy is stated in What you want to know about VERA Files Fact Check, which, in turn, states that Vera Files doesnt take money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

This claim is false because Vera Files has been getting funding from the US Department of State-funded CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Annual funding since 2016 totals US$ 272,600 so far, US$ 75,000 of which was granted in 2019.

A screengrab of NED's grants to Vera Files per NED website.

NED itself describes its origins with this statement:
When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly.
Given this, I believe that I need not explain further how NED qualifies as a partisan group.

This funding source may be an even bigger cause for concern in as far as Vera Files claims of nonpartisanship because the Duterte Administration is at loggerheads with the United States, which is best exemplified by the recent cancellation of the Visiting Forces Agreement.

How can Vera Files be expected to write anything against the United States when it sources its funding from US-funded NED whose job is to wage the battle of ideas at international forums?

Note that a vast majority of Vera Files fact-checks are about Administration-aligned figures, as evidenced by its answers in Criterion 2a: Body of work sample, which asks for a list of ten fact checks that better represent the scope and consistency of Vera Files fact-checking.

Seven of the ten listed are against administration-aligned figures (2: Angara, 3: Chong, 5: Ong, 7: Enrile, 8: Duterte, 9: Locsin, 10: Andanar), and the only opposition-aligned figure in that list is a blogger and not even an opposition official.

Case in point, Vera Files has yet to fact-check anything about opposition stalwart and Magdalo Senator Antonio Trillanes, and the Public can't help but wonder if Vera Files head Ellen Tordesillas' close personal and professional relationship with a Magdalo party member has something to do with it .

WHAT SHOULD BE DONE
FIRST, Vera Files should practice what it preaches, something that it sorely failed to do in the assailed Sonza-Nieto article.

SECOND, Vera Files should issue an erratum to acknowledge the false and libelous statements it propounded in the same.

THIRD, Poynter-IFCN should review Vera Files compliance with membership requirements, as the above discussion clearly demonstrates that the latter forwarded false claims in its application.

I would like to believe that many of Poynter-IFCNs administrators believe that the organizations true goal is to help combat the proliferation of fake news. Unfortunately, it appears that no less than one of its supposedly esteemed members, Vera Files, is guilty of it.",RJ Nieto,"March 9, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/03/drilononcnn-case-for-firing-fact.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
In the service of the Filipino? How ABS-CBN's Lopezes used mass media since World War II,"Davao businessman Dennis Uy recently asked President Rodrigo Duterte for a sovereign guarantee to cover a Php 700 million loan for Uys Chelsea Logistics. Eyebrows rose, of course, including those of Bayan Muna chairperson Neri Colmenares.

A Sovereign Guarantee is a Government assurance that it will pay loans should the original debtor fail to pay them. That is, a sovereign guarantee means taxpayers will pay Chelseas loans if Chelsea fails to, after all.

Yes, I do understand the uproar, but, but I believe its still premature. For one, Malacaang has not even considered Uys request yet. Uy asked for a sovereign guarantee, but the President has not yet given one.

Besides, I sincerely doubt that Uy is a Lopez.

Wait! What? ABS-CBNs Lopezes again? Yes, those Lopezes again.


LOPEZ, BENPRES, AND NLEX
In an interview with DWIZ, former ABS-CBN journalist Jay Sonza accused the Lopezes of deliberately helping machinate the downfall of President Joseph Erap Estrada, after Erap declined the Lopezes request for a Sovereign Guarantee.

Sonza said:
Noong nakuha ng Benpres ang NLEX, itong North Luzon Expressway, kailangan nila (Lopezes) ng foreign funding para sa expansion, saka maintenance, modernization. E hindi sila makakuha ng funding kung hindi magkakaroon ng Sovereign Guarantee.
TRANSLATION: After Benpres acquired NLEX, the North Luzon Expressway, [The Lopezes] needed foreign funding for its expansion, maintenance, and modernization. But they cant get funding without a Sovereign Guarantee.
Benpres Holdings Corporation, now known as Lopez Holdings Corporation, is the parent company of all Lopez-owned firms, including ABS-CBN Corporation.

The BenPres building in Ortigas Center
Sonzas claim that the Lopez Group was in dire financial straits appears to be backed by a 2011 expose from veteran columnist Neal Cruz.

According to Cruz, the Lopez Group defaulted on Php 1.6 billion worth of behest loans from the government-owned Development of the Philippines, namely:
1. Maynilad, when it borrowed Php 710.86 million in 2000 then defaulted in 2003 after Maynilads balance sheets went Php 5.2 billion in the red. Maynilad, at the time, was 59.1% owned by the Lopez Family via Benpres Holdings.
2. BayanTel, when it borrowed Php 591.81 million in 1995 then started failing to amortize in 2001, when the outstanding balance was at US$ 11.2 million.
3. SkyCable, when it borrowed Php 207.10 million in 1997 and became past due in 2001.
4. Benpres Holdings, when it borrowed Php 157.95 million in 1996 and went past due in 2002 when Benpres stopped paying.
All these loans were written off. As to why, Id rather reserve that discussion for another article because this one is already very lengthy as it is.

LOPEZ FIRMS ALMOST WENT BANKRUPT
As you can see, three of the four loans were secured on or before the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, which resulted in massive currency devaluations throughout the region. The Philippine Peso traded at 30 to a dollar in August 1997, then it exploded to Php 42 just five months later in January 1998. The peso continued to nosedive and by October 2000, the exchange rate was at Php 50.

The Lopezes earned in pesos and not dollars, so the dismal exchange rate caused their dollar-denominated loans to balloon to levels that crippled Bayantel and Maynilad.
A firm thats deep in the red in on a race against time: it has to start turning a profit before it goes totally bankrupt. Loans can give troubled companies more time to fix their act, but how can financial institutions lend to the broke?
The answer is simple: sovereign guarantees. If a loan is has government-backing, then theres little risk of default because taxpayers will, by law, shoulder the loan if the company defaults.

And according to Sonza, thats precisely what the Lopezes aimed for.

In the same DWIZ Interview, Sonza said:
Pinipilit si Erap na pumirma ng Sovereign Guarantee. Inayawan ni Erap. O e di inumpisahan si Erap hanggang matanggal.
TRANSLATION: They were egging Erap to sign the Sovereign Guarantee. Erap refused, so they started on Erap until he was deposed.

SONZA: LOPEZ ASKED ERAP FOR SOVEREIGN GUARANTEE
Sonza added:
Iniyawan niya yung Sovereign Guarantee diyan sa NLEx at sa Maynilad Water Services.
TRANSLATION: Erap refused to give Sovereign Guarantee to NLEx and Maynila Water Services.
While he was still in power, lots of companies pestered Erap for sovereign guarantees.


For example, while being cross-examined in his plunder trial, Erap told the Sandiganbayan:
I rejected that P40 million offered by Mark Jimenez because I did not want that sovereign guarantee provision in the contract. I knew that if Impsa fails to pay its debts, the government would assume its payment and that would badly affect the people.""
Erap was referring to the $470-million hydroelectric power contract between the Philippine government and Argentinian firm Industrias Metalurgica Pescarmona Sociedad Anonima (Impsa), where the prosecution alleged that businessman Mark Jimenez bribed the former president.

In a 2007 press statement about the plethora of sovereign guarantees issued by President Fidel Ramos to various power companies, Eraps son Senator Jinggoy Estrada said:
Hindi nya tinanggap yon dahil may sovereign guarantee. Ibig sabihin ginagaratiyahan ng ating bansa ung kontrata, ayaw ni Pangulong Estrada.
TRANSLATION: He didnt accept that because theres a sovereign guarantee (requirement). That means the State is guaranteeing the contract, which President Estrada didnt want.
Erap is no saint, but I cannot find a single record showing that Erap granted sovereign guarantees to anybody.

Moreover, the Estrada bio for the 2015 Most Outstanding Mayor Award (MOMA) states:
Determined to bring his pro-poor platform to every facet of the governments operations, he immediately ordered the removal of all sovereign guarantees on contracts for public projects xxx Reconds will show that until January 20, 2001, he did not sign a single government contract with a sovereign guarantee.
Sans claims to the contrary, I think its safe to say that Erap really didnt issue any sovereign guarantee. Im not commenting on the wisdom of his governance (or the lack of it), but the hard fact is that he didnt issue any sovereign guarantee.

ERAP VS THE LOPEZES ETC
Eraps unaccommodating stance must have had a catastrophic effect on the Lopez Group, whose subsidiaries were slowly dying one by one.

But a friendlier replacement may not come in time: Erap was still in the first half of his Presidency.

The Constitution states that only the President has the power to issue sovereign guarantees, so if I were someone who badly needs a major financial lifeline that only a President can give, then Id convince the President to give me one.

But he wont, so the next best thing is to wait for him to step down then ask the next president, but this one just got elected this year. Will my companies survive for the next six years?

Its not just Sonzas sovereign guarantee issue.

Erap in a 2006 speech said just three months into his presidential term, the Ayalas and Lopezes asked him to raise water rates by 80 percent.

Erap said:
I gained their ire when I turned down their request xxx my slogan is Erap para sa Mahirap xxx If I approve their request the poor Filipinos might rephrase my slogan into Erap Pampahirap.""
A loan is a loan, but a water rate hike is basically free money from the People.

Erap added:
Business is a gamble. If you lose in business, you cannot pass your losses to the people. If they win in their business, will they share it to the people?""
Well, if I were in the Lopezes shoes at a time like that, I may have wished for his deposal. And obviously, Id use ABS-CBN, which had a virtual monopoly on public opinion, to realize that goal.


Erap was deposed a little over two years later in January 2001.

I guess even the 1999 wedding of scion Beaver Lopez and Erap daughter Jackie Ejercito did nothing to change Erap's mind.

It's still a problem up to this day.

Yes, Erap made a lot of mistakes. But in as far as the possible motives for removing a president, I think money is most likely on the top of the list.

Sonzas claim that Lopezes use media assets to attack competing interests is not really new, as a 2000 peer-reviewed paper published by Cambridge University Press shows that the Lopezes have a long history of using media assets to attack their political opponents.

In Kinship Politics in Post-War Philippines: The Lopez Family, 1945-1989 , Mina Roces of the University of New South Wales narrated the Lopez Familys ascent from a regional economic power in Ilo-ilo to the wealthiest clan in the country.


The story is quite long, so Ill just focus on the parts that are immediately relevant to this discussion. Note that unless otherwise stated, all contents of the following sections are based on Roces paper.

THE MEDIA-POWERED RISE OF THE LOPEZES 
The massive Lopez fortune started with two Lopez brothers: Fernando, who was involved in Politics, and Eugenio Sr., who focused on business.

Fernando Lopez
Fernandos meteoric rise in Politics started in 1945 when President Sergio Osmena appointed mayor of Iloilo, and President Manuel Roxas reappointed him a year later. He eventually became the vice-president, then the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources for three terms.


Roces wrote:
Thus began a symbiotic relationship between politics and business that thrived on the closeness of the two brothers. With one brother in politics, the Lopez family had the passkey to the realm of special privileges that gave them access to the credit and franchises sealed of to families deprived of political power. While one brother made political connections, the other was the shrewd and ruthless businessman who utilized these special privileges for the family business corporations.
The Lopezes bought the leading broadsheet The Manila Chronicle in September 1947, a critical juncture of Fernandos budding political career.


Roces noted that The Manila Chronicle never turned a profit, so she wondered why a business-savvy Eugenio Sr. kept it running for 24 years.

The Lopezes used the newspaper to all political and business enemies, including the President of the Philippines. Using the newspapers power to shape public opinion, the Lopezes forced political and business enemies to yield to the Lopez Familys demands.

Referring to The Manila Chronicle, Roces even said:
The paper was notorious for biased reporting.
Sounds familiar? Mhm, I know.

Fernando Lopez became a senator just two years into his mayoralty and just three months after acquiring The Manila Chronicle, which praised him all the time.


At a time when taxes from the sugar industry made up 43% of government revenue, the very powerful Lopez-led sugar barons in 1949 convinced presidentiable Elpidio Quirino to pick Fernando as his running mate.

Quirino didnt regret his decision, as The Manila Chronicle ran full-page ads for the Quirino-Lopez ticket while not placing any for rivals Laurel-Briones and Avelino-Francisco.


Backed by a major mass media company and the money of the all-powerful sugar bloc, Fernando became vice-president in 1949.

Fernando was Vice-president and Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources from 1949 to 1953 and from 1965 to 1971, and a senator in between.

While Fernando headed Agriculture and Natural Resources, Eugenio bought the following:
1: Binalbagan-Isabela Sugar Company (BISCOM), the largest sugar company in Southeast Asia that helped Sugar Bloc members expand their businesses 
2: Pampanga Sugar Mill (PASUMIL), which became the Lopezes second sugar central 
3: Philippine Portland Cement 
4: Industrial Company, which made the jute packaging for sugar 
5: ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation 
6: Manila Electric Company (MERALCO)
ABS-CBN is neither Agriculture nor Natural Resources, but I think its safe to say that the Lopezes learned from their ownership and control of The Manila Chronicle that mass media could do wonders.

BISCOM, PASUMIL, and Industrial Company fall under agriculture, while Philippine Portland Cement and MERALCO fall under Natural Resources.

And Fernando, at the time of their acquisition, was the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.

What a coincidence!

MACAPAGAL VS THE LOPEZ SUGAR BLOC
In the 1960s, President Diosdado Macapagal attacked the Lopez and what he called the Lopez Sugar Bloc when he argued that the Lopez and friends used their political connections to get loans from the government-owned DBP, Philippine National Bank (PNB), and Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).

Diosdado Macapagal with daughter Gloria
Included in the loans Macapagal listed are (M denotes million, K denotes thousand):
BISCOM  Php 32.49 M from DBP, Php 3.5 M from PNB 
PASUMIL  Php 4.788 M from DBP, Php 1.2 M from PNB 
Philippine Portland Cement  Php 2.355 M from DBP 
Industrial Company  P1.45 M from DBP 
ABS-CBN  Php 2.875 M from DBP, Php 485 K from PNB, Php 500K from GSIS 
Manila Chronicle  Php 2 M from PNB 
MERALCO  Php 35 M from PNB
Adding DBP and PNB loans of other Lopez companies, thats Php 88.373 million as of 1962.

Just how much is Php 88.373 million?
A peso in 1962 is equal to USD 0.27 so that Php 88.373 million equals USD 23.96 million. Using an inflation calculator, USD 23.96 million in 1962 is equal to USD 204.67 million in 2020. With the 2020 USD:PHP exchange rate hovering at around 1:50, then thats roughly Php 10.2335 billion pesos today.
That is, Php 88.373 million in 1962 can buy as many things as Php 10.233 billion in 2020.

Needless to say, the Lopezes again used their TV, Radio, and Print assets to prevent Macapagals reelection in 1965, or the year Ferdinand Marcos ran for president with Fernando Lopez as running mate.

And they did, as Roces wrote:
The Marcos-Lopez campaign was launched on January 6, 1965. During the entire year of 1965 The Manila Chronicle had almost daily reports on the activities and the speeches of both candidates, while the Macapagal Administration was continuously and ruthless attacked.
Macapagal and Pelaez stepped out, Marcos and Lopez stepped in.

Several years later, Marcos also tried to do what Macapagal did, i.e., wage war against the Lopezes. But this article is already running long, so lets talk about that on another day.

Regardless, whats clear is that based on this discussion, the Lopezes historically exploited their media assets to further their personal interests.

Amidst ABS-CBNs franchise renewal issue, I encourage everyone to keep it real: Let us stop deluding ourselves into thinking that ABS-CBN did nothing but be In the Service of the Filipino.

Just like you, I sometimes get shocked about what other people say, especially when their words go against what I have believed for the longest time.

But then, our political consciousness is shaped mostly by what we see on TV. But then, who ultimately decides on most of what we get to see on TV?

Rufino-Prieto firms cannibalizing the financially ailing Philippine Daily Inquirer?,"Documents show Philippine Daily Inquirers majority owners, the Rufino-Prieto Clan, are using their other family-owned companies to cannibalize what little is left of the newspaper companys assets, at the expense of minority stockholders who may be left with nothing if and when the media firm declares bankruptcy.

PDI sells land to Lexmedia
On 29 August 2018, Inquirer directors approved the sale of Inquirer-owned land near the Makati Central Business District. The board, at the time, is mostly made up of members of the Rufino-Prieto Clan, including:
Alexandra Sandy Prieto-Romualdez (President)
Carlos Rufino
Macario Rufino (Treasurer)
Paolo Prieto
Marixi Prieto
The sale involves six parcels of land totaling 1,990 sqm, where the Philippine Daily Inquirers head offices stand on . The Deeds of Absolute Sale  of the PDI-owned  lots show they were sold to a certain Lexmedia Reality Inc. for a total of Php 156,000,000, broken down as follows:
TCT No. 182449  324 sqm  Php 21,700,000
TCT No. 182450  331 sqm  Php 29,600,000
TCT No. 182451  340 sqm  Php 30,400,000
TCT No. 182452  340 sqm  Php 30,400,000
TCT No. 182453  331 sqm  Php 22,200,000
TCT No. 182454  324 sqm  Php 21,700,000
That is, the Rufino-Prietos sold the lots for no more than Php 78,392 per sqm.


A suspiciously low price
The sale price raises suspicion because the Zonal Value of the six Barangay Tejeros lots along Chino Roces Avenue is Php 120,000 per sqm based on Department of Finance Department Order 24-2017 .

To illustrate the point even further, listings for lots within the same general area are for much higher prices, one listing for a 641-sqm lot  is for Php 300,000 per sqm, while another listing for a 511-sqm lot  is for Php 245,000 per sqm.

Why were the Rufino-Prietos sell PDI-owned land, caring little about the losses they incurred for selling it at so much lower than market rates, to the detriment of PDI shareholders?

The Rufino-Prietos, for example, could have listed the land for 25% more or around Php 100,000 per sqm, and somebody wouldve readily bought it.

Oh! I almost forgot to mention that the sale includes all improvements in the six lots, including the Inquirer Building itself.

Lexmedia bought PDI land at lower than market value, implying that the Rufino-Prietos gave away the Inquirer building and all other improvements to Lexmedia FOR FREE.

Why did the Rufino-Prietos do what they did?
I honestly do not care if the Rufino-Prietos throw money on the streets. Still, we must remember that we are talking about the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which has minority shareholders comprised of lowly journalists who dreamt of a better economic future for themselves.

The decision to sell PDI land at scandalously low prices affects not just the Rufino-Prieto Family but also the minority shareholders who are not part of the PDI board that approved the sale.


PDIs owners as of 2018  show at least thirteen minority shareholders, including the veteran journalist Vic Agustin, who in October 2019 sued the Rufino-Prietos for Syndicated Estafa precisely for these allegedly onerous transactions .
Syndicated estafa is swindling committed by a syndicate of five or more persons. In Agustins lawsuit, that syndicate is the Rufino-Prietos.
The preceding section showed that the Rufino-Prietos, sitting as PDI directors, sold PDI land below-market prices, resulting in financial injury to PDI as a corporation because they couldve quickly sold the same land at a much higher price.

But then, an injury to PDI must also be an injury to the Rufino-Prietos, being that the latter are majority shareholders of PDI. That sounds contradictory, right?


Well, not if you check on who the Rufino-Prietos sold the PDI land to.

Who owns Lexmedia?
The Rufino-Prietos, acting as the agents of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, sold the six lots to Lexmedia, so that the next logical question would be who owns that company?

This is a tricky question because it appears that, based on documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Lexmedias ownership structure is buried in layers upon layers of corporations.


To illustrate, Lexmedias ownership structure  is as follows:
Pentap  40.56%
Mediacom  10.19%
Inquirer Holdings  10.15%
Corinthian  2.57%
Alexandra Prieto  3.83%
Carlos Rufino  0.83%
Paolo Prieto  2.42%
Others
(Note that from hereon, all mentions of any of the five Rufino-Prieto PDI directors will be highlighted in red.)

There are three Rufino-Prietos in the list (Alexandra, Carlos, and Paolo) but a majority of the shares belong to corporations (Pentap, Mediacom, Inq Holdings, and Corinthian), so lets check the ownership structures of each of these four owner-firms.


Pentaps owners:
Granprie  20%
Paolo Prieto  20%
Alexandra Prieto  20%
Others
Mediacoms owners :
LRP  68.92%
Others
Inquirer Holdings owners :
Pinnacle  68.89%
Others
Corinthians owners :
Marilex  31.85%
Ionian  11.19%
Macario Rufino  5.49%
Carlos Rufino  5.8%
Alexandra Prieto  1.82%
Marixi Prieto  1.86%
Paolo Prieto  1.82%
Others
At this point, you can see the names of the same Rufino-Prieto PDI directors are popping up. But we are not done yet, as we check the owners of the other corporations mentioned, namely Marilex, Ionian, LRP, Pinnacle, and GranPrie.

Marilexs owners :
Granprie  11.43%
Marixi Prieto  4.28%
Alexandra Prieto  8.57%
Paolo Prieto  8.58%
Others
Ionians owners :

Using data from the General Information sheets of each of the corporations mentioned above, I took the liberty of creating a diagram that illustrates the ownership structure of Lexmedia. The chart takes into consideration the intricate web of corporate layers that ultimately end in one or more of the same five Rufino-Prieto PDI directors.

A diagram showing Lexmedia's corporate ownership. Each large rectangle is a predominantly Rufino-Prieto family firm. Each red rounded box is a Rufino-Prieto family member who also sits in the Philippine Daily Inquirer's board of directors.

Note that based on the same General Information Sheets, one or more of the six PDI directors are also on the board of each of the corporations mentioned above.

These data show that after peeling off a sufficient number of corporate layers, Lexmedia appears to be primarily owned and controlled by the same five Rufino-Prieto directors of the Philippine Daily Inquirer.

In short, the Rufino-Prietos basically sold Inquirer-owned land to themselves.

Whats the problem with this?
PDIs Rufino-Prieto directors sold PDI-owned land to Lexmedia at a mind-bogglingly low price. The sale hurt the interests of PDI shareholders, and these are the Rufino-Prieto directors plus PDIs minority shareholders. Hence, why would the Rufino-Prietos hurt not only PDIs minority shareholders but also themselves?

As it turns out, the only ones hurt by the deal are PDIs minority shareholders, as Lexmedia, who bought the property at an extremely low price, is also owned and controlled by the same Rufino-Prieto PDI directors who approved the sale.

We know that the Inquirer has been hemorrhaging in as early as 2017, when declared Php 320 million in losses after tax . I personally doubt that the Inquirer can get out of the red and survive, especially since the Digital Age has brought the demise of newspapers all over the world. For example, more than 20% of all newspapers in the United States have closed down since 2014 .

Hence, I would understand why the Rufino-Prietos would try to hedge risk by evacuating assets from an ailing company. However, what I do not understand is how they can do it without taking into consideration the interests of other company owners who do not belong to their clan.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer was born in the late 80s as an earnest attempt to create a media company that is owned and controlled not by the moneyed elite, but by journalists themselves.

Initially intended to take the form of a journalist cooperative but registered as a corporation for expediency, the Inquirer started with the hope that all those working for it could share the responsibility and hopefully, the rewards .

Inquirer even had a very peculiar by-law in its original Articles of Incorporation: that only Inquirer permanent employees can own Inquirer stocks .

But this by-law didnt last long as the Rufino-Prietos took over in 1990s and established a virtual monopoly on Inquirers corporate decision-making.

Despite my strong reservations on the quality of Inquirers current fleet of journalists, I cannot deny the fact that the Inquirer was borne with the noble hope of giving journalists better lives without asking them to sell their bodies and souls to the devil.

Its bad enough that Inquirer failed to fulfill that promise, but what makes matters so much worse is that the same people who helped create their company  the minority shareholders  stand to lose whatever little they can get in the end.

As Lexmedia and the Rufino-Prieto companies, in apparent anticipation of Inquirers bankruptcy declaration, cannibalize whats left of the Philippine Daily Inquirers assets, what will happen to the minority shareholders, some of whom are even journalists themselves, who werent lucky enough to have Rufino or Prieto as a last name? 


And how about the Philippine Daily Inquirer's creditors, if any?",RJ Nieto,"January 26, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/01/rufino-prieto-firms-cannibalizing.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
UP Naming Binarat? UP gets only 22/sqm monthly from UP-Ayala Technohub,"The University of the Philippines Systems 2018 Commission on Audit Report  states that UP has two Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects with Ayala Land: the UP-Ayala Technohub along Commonwealth and the UP Town Center along Katipunan.

The two projects are business deals, so common sense dictates that the revenue sharing structure should be commensurate to how much each business partner invested in the venture.

Documents, however, show that it isnt the case, as Ayala keeps the lions share of profits.
[Full Disclosure: I was a Math Major in the University of the Philippines - Diliman.]



The UP Ayala Technohub

The UP Ayala Technohub partnership basically works like this: UP contributes land, Ayala provides improvements, Ayala leases out property to various tenants, then lease revenues are split between UP and Ayala. 

Hence, the next logical question would be how much each one gets.

The UP Ayala Technohub has four components: office space, residential space, hotels, and retail space. Based on the same COA Annual Audit Report, the revenue sharing structure for each of these components, expressed as a ratio of UPs share to Ayalas, is as follows:
 Office Space  10:90 for buildings, 15:85 for land 
 Residential  5:95 
 Hotel  5:95 
 Retail  10:90 for buildings, 15:85 for land
Given this, why does UP get only 5- 15% of revenues while Ayala gets the lions share? 

A screenshot of COA's 2018 Annual Audit of the UP System, showing the revenue sharing structure for the UP Ayala Technohub Project.

The same COA report states that UP has collected a total of Php 1.094 billion  from the Technohub Project during the 11 years from 2008 to 2018.
The exact figure, Php 1,093,867,441.43, when divided by 11 years, translates to Php 99,442,494.66 annually or Php 8,286,874.55 monthly.
That sounds like a lot of money for UP, but given that the UP leased Ayala 380,630 sqm  of UP land, Ayalas payments to UP amount to a monthly rent of just Php 21.77 per sqm.

A screenshot of COA's 2018 Annual Audit of the UP System, showing Ayala's payments to the UP System in relation to the Technohub Project.

In fairness to Ayala, it developed only 20 hectares during its first phase, and generously assuming that it didnt expand at all since then, UPs total collections is basically a monthly rental payment of Php 41.43 per sqm.

We're talking about prime real estate here: Only an idiot would lease out a prime lot in Quezon City for less than Php 50 per sqm.



What is Fair?
Recall that UPs lease revenue share ranges from 5-15% depending on the type of real estate. For ease of computation, lets give Ayala a headstart by assuming that UP gets the maximum 15% on everything, which makes the revenue sharing structure a uniform 15:85.

Recall that UP contributed 380,630 sqm to the venture. Modestly assuming that land along Commonwealth Avenue costs Php 20,000 per square meter in 2006 when the deal was signed, UPs equity in the partnership would amount to Php 7.61 billion.

Ayala, meanwhile, earmarked for the UP Ayala Technohub Php 6 billion over the next 5-10 years .

Even if we assume that Ayala shelled out the entire Php 6 billion on the first year, that would still mean, based on the above figures, that the total equity in the entire venture is Php 13.61 billion, with UP providing 56% and Ayala 44%.

If the capital sharing is 56:44, then why is the revenue sharing only 15:85 at best?

If you contributed over half of the capital in a business venture, would you be fine with receiving less than a fifth of revenues?


A Disturbing Business Arrangement?

The UP-Ayala revenue sharing structure is especially disturbing on the following grounds:
First, UPs Real Estate Tax Exemption
UP is exempt from paying real estate taxes  based on the Supreme Court decision on UP v City Treasurer. In that case, the City Treasurer of Quezon City said UP was delinquent on Php 107 million in real estate taxes for the years 2009 to 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, or a period of 63 months.

This translates to Php 1.7 million worth of monthly real estate tax payments that Ayala could have paid the government if UP wasnt tax-exempt. That is, Ayala saved Php 4.46 per sqm in tax payments because it partnered with UP.

Despite this, Ayala gives UP just Php 21.77 per sqm on the average, while Ayalas revenue share ranges from roughly Php 123 to Php 414 per sqm , or anywhere from 566 to 1,900% more.

Second, Ayala charges tenants a lot
Some property listings for Ayala Technohub office spaces show Ayala charges tenants a lot of money.

For example, a Php 450,000 is the monthly rent for a 600 sqm office space listing , or Php 750 per sqm per month. And theres even another 2,300 sqm office space for Php 1,495,000 a month , or Php 650 per sqm.

UP Ayala Technohub has a gross leasable area  of 156,708.75 sqm. Generously assuming a constant office space vacancy rate of 16% in Quezon City, and modestly assuming a monthly rent of Php 650 per sqm, then the UP Ayala Technohub must be collecting around Php 85.6 million in monthly rentals for office space alone, 10 percent of which (UPs share) is Php 8.56 million.

This doesnt look very different from the Php 8.29 million UP gets monthly per the COA report, but the gross leasable area Ayala provided is based only on Buildings A to O . This doesnt include revenues from  the four-storey Building P with 2,660 sqm per floor  and  the 120-guestroom, six-storey Microtel .

Given this, is Ayala Land accurately reporting revenues or is it under-declaring revenues in order to pay UP less?

Remember that COA audits UP but COA doesn't audit Ayala.

Third, something fishy about the UP Board
Its bad enough that UP apparently receives a pittance from the Ayala deal but to make it worse, Ayalas payments even come late or not all. 

For example, COA in 2014 chided UP Diliman chancellor Michael Tan for the universitys laxity and leniency in enforcing the UP-Ayala Technohub Contract after Ayala had P76 million in unpaid rent and P3.06 million in penalties .

To make matters even worse, the UP Board is not even giving UP Diliman its rightful share of what little revenue UP receives from Technohub.

The UP Board of Regents in 2012 approved a 60-40 Income Sharing Scheme between the UP System and UP Diliman, but COA said the Board has so far failed to issue proper guidelines to turn this scheme into reality .

The UP System has so far failed to remit to UP Diliman over Php 287 million in revenues from the Technohub deal and COA said it had no definite schedule or plan as to when they should remit the share of UP Diliman .

Had the UP System given UP Diliman its rightful share, then UP Diliman wouldve been able to fund important projects like desperately needed building renovations and maintenance outlays.


The Bottom-line
Much like the notaries Ayala-owned Manila Waters concession deal, it seems the government also got the shorter end of the stick in as far as the UP Ayala Technohub project.

The UP Ayala Technohub as an Ayala charity project: it is, instead, a full-fledged for-profit business venture.

While I agree that UP Dilimans vast landowning on the far side of Commonwealth Avenue is largely grassland prior to the Ayala Project, its grassland in the middle of Quezon City where land is extremely scarce and infrastructure is far more available than most areas in the country.

Moreover, the single biggest challenge facing businesses, especially those that heavily rely on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), is finding quality talent for its workforce.

But thats not really problem for those in Technohub because job applicants are literally situated JUST ACROSS THE ROAD, i.e. UP Diliman, one of the countrys top universities.

With that said, why did UP enter a deal that just pays them peanuts?

And we haven't even mentioned the UP Town Center yet.",RJ Nieto,"January 18, 2020",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2020/01/up-naming-binarat-up-gets-only-22sqm.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
ABS-CBNs Franchise Renewal: Will Lopezes make ultimate sacrifice to save thousands of jobs?,"Most of us are already familiar and have a working understanding of the ABS-CBN franchise renewal issue, but to give you a refresher, heres the basic issue.

Every free-to-air TV or radio station is required to secure a congressional franchise in the form of a Republic Act, a franchise that usually lasts for 25 years. A new franchise (READ: A New Republic Act) is needed to operate after those 25 years.

ABS-CBN received its franchise on 30 March 1995 via RA No. 7966, so it needs to get a new one before RA No. 7966 expires 25 years later on 30 March 2020.

And thats the problem.


Why need a franchise?
The Constitution guarantees Press Freedom, but it doesnt guarantee access to broadcast frequencies. While anyone has the right to engage in journalism, not everyone has the right to have sole use of any broadcast frequency, as Physics sets limitations on the latter.

In the case of TV, there are at most 12 available VHF channels (Channels 2, 3, to 13) and at most 38 in the UHF band (Channels 14 to 51).
Reporters without Borders recognized this reality when it wrote (emphasis supplied):
Licensing became necessary as broadcast frequencies constitute a scarce resource In Metro Manila for example, the frequency is limited to 23 physical spots for TV channels, 32 spots for AM radio channels, and 25 FM spots  and they are all taken at the moment.
The TV firm ABS-CBN, by virtue of Press Freedom, has the right to create and distribute content, but broadcasting through the Channel 2 Frequency is a privilege. ABS-CBNs dominion over Channel 2 means some other TV operator failed to get it, and this privilege was granted to ABS-CBN only by an Act of Congress.


Imagine this:
If ABS-CBN as a Filipino entity has the inalienable right to broadcast via a frequency, then the equal protection clause of the constitution means every other Filipino should enjoy the same right. Applying this to Metro Manila, how can 23 physical TV spots be distributed among Metro Manilas over 10 million residents?
Thats clearly impossible, hence the need for the government to decide who among aspiring broadcasters are in the best position to serve Public Interest, i.e., who among them is most deserving of receiving a franchise, i.e., a privilege.


Suffice it to say, the ABS-CBN Franchise Renewal Issue arises not from Free Speech or Press Freedom as defined in the Constitution, but from Public Services as defined in the Public Services Law.

Will ABS-CBNs Franchise be renewed?
Two bills were filed in September 2014: one by Baguio Rep. Nicasio Aliping, and another by Isabela Rep. Giorgidi Aggabao. Inquirer reported that both failed to pass because then-President Aquinos House allies felt [ABS-CBNs] criticisms against the President were too personal and offensive and went to the point of nitpicking.

After failing to renew their franchise under the 16th Congress (2013-2016), ABS-CBN hoped to get it in the 17th Congress (2016-2019). Nueva Ecija Rep. Micaela Violago attempted this through her House Bill No. 4349 filed in November 2016, but it failed to pass.

Were at the 18th Congress (2019-2022) and its make-or-break for the Lopez-owned ABS-CBN, as its franchise expires in just a few months.

Unfortunately, an immensely popular president is against it.

In as late as 30 December 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte told the Lopezes:
Itong ABS, mag-expire ang contract ninyo. Mag-renew kayo, ewan ko lang kung may mangyari diyan. Kung ako sa inyo ipagbili niyo na yan. (ABS-CBNs contract is about to expire. I dont know if youll get renewed. Id sell it off if I were you.)
Duterte has vocally opposed ABS-CBNs renewal citing, among others, its failure to run his paid political advertisements during the 2016 presidential race, even threatening to file estafa (swindling) charges against the company.


Oh, and do you remember what ABS-CBN aired on the night before election day?

This, and it was paid for by opposition Senator Antonio Trillanes:



A glimmer of hope?
Senator Ralph Rectos August 2019 SB No. 981 , Nueva Ecija Rep. Micaela Violagos refiled HB No. 676 and Laguna Rep. (and former ABS-CBN employee) Sol Aragones HB No. 3947 all aim to renew ABS-CBNs expiring franchise. 

The three bills, however, are still pending as of 04 January 2020, or less than three months from the current franchise expiry on 30 March 2020.

Despite Dutertes opposition, some of his allies, including Deputy Speakers Vilma Santos, Rose Marie Arenas, Aurelio Gonzales, and Johnny Pimentel, strongly backed ABS-CBNs franchise renewal. Meanwhile, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano departed from his historically Duterte Diehard Supporter (DDS) stance and instead said he would be fair on this issue.

Assuming that one of the house bills (or maybe a consolidated version) somehow passes on the third reading, ABS-CBN still wont be out the woods because the counterpart Senate Bill (Rectos SB No. 981) will still have to pass by a simple majority (13 votes).

What makes this problematic is the fact that the Senate is chock full of administration allies and senators who may hold grudges against the company.

ABS-CBNs problem with 23 Senators
Lets list down some senators who may find it difficult to OK the proposal.

[Sen. #1 to #6] Six senators are from the Presidents PDP-Laban (Manny Pacquiao, Juan Miguel Zubiri, Bato dela Rosa, Bong Go, Koko Pimentel, and Francis Tolentino) and people generally expect them to vote along party lines.

[Sen. #7] Sen. Nancy Binay (UNA) may view ABS-CBN as among the media companies that helped destroy her father Jejomar Binays political prospects.

[Sen. #8] Sen. Bong Revilla (Lakas) may view ABS-CBN as among those who helped put him under detention.

[Sen. #9 to #12] Senators Dick Gordon (VNP), Ping Lacson (Ind), Joel Villanueva (CIBAC), and Win Gatchalian (NPC) are generally mum on the issue, but theyre up for re-election for a second term in 2022, so will they risk incurring the wrath of the heavily pro-Duterte electorate?

[Sen. #13] Sen. Imee Marcos may be unlikely to vote in favor of it, and the political reason is pretty obvious.

Note that Senator Leila de Lima is in detention for drug charges so she cant vote on the bill, so only 23 senators will decide on it.

That is, at least 13 out of the 23 senators face significant political disincentives to vote for renewal. Assuming that ABS-CBN gets the vote of the remaining ten senators, it will have to convince three among the fourteen listed above.

What are the chances that SB No. 981 will pass? Well...

Duterte the Gatekeeper
Now, lets assume that the bill hurdles Congress and arrives at Malacaang.

Earlier last year, Presidential Communications Sec. Martin Andanar opined that the President is unlikely to veto the bill, but he based this solely on his observation that the president never categorically said Hindi ko ie-extend ang franchise (I will not extend the franchise).

But just because Duterte didnt say so doesnt mean he wont, and the presidents statements in the past couple of weeks suggest that he may exercise veto power.

If that happens, Congress will have to override the veto by a two-thirds vote with each House voting separately. That is, two-thirds (around 200 solons) of the House and another two-thirds (16 senators) of the Senate is needed to override the Presidents veto.

That will be tough because six PDP-Laban senators are averse to openly humiliating the president, so its just a matter of getting two more senators to vote against a veto override (Marcos, Revilla, and Binay, are strong candidates).

ABS-CBNs franchise renewal saga will be an excruciatingly steep climb for the Lopezes.

Options for the Lopezes
Faced with the imminent threat of closure on 30 March 2020, Duterte openly advised the Lopezes to sell ABS-CBN, but it appears that the Lopezes are averse to that prospect.

There are a few alternative options that I can think of: 
1: Acquire another company that has an existing broadcast franchise
PRO: Assuming theres a willing seller, the problem will merely be a matter of adjusting the broadcast frequency and it will be business as usual.

CON: The VHF frequency (Channels 2 to 13) is already tightly packed, so ABS-CBN will likely broadcast on the UHF spectrum (Channels 14 to 51). Unfortunately, UHF may have poorer signal quality in far-flung areas, i.e., ABS-CBN may reach a smaller chunk of the population, which will likely hurt advertising revenues and aggregate influence on public opinion.

2: Syndicate content to other networks
PRO: ABS-CBN can just sell airing rights to its shows to other networks, or maybe buy block time in, say, Manny Pangilinans TV5.

CON: ABS-CBN wont be able to broadcast political content, which it has historically used to great effect. Thatd be like pulling ABS-CBNs widely-feared political fangs off.

3: Forget free-to-air TV and go fully online
PRO: Online means no franchise needed, and ABS-CBN already has the streaming platform iWant.

CON: Philippine Internet is slow and currently has lower coverage than TV. Meanwhile, iWants user interface is still very crude and superior competitors like Netflix, HBO Go, and Amazon Prime make iWant look like a high school project.

Arguably, all of these options will diminish ABS-CBNs influence, and thats a problem for the Lopezes.

Will people lose jobs?
Understandably, many ABS-CBN employees feel threatened as they face the prospect of losing their jobs if and when ABS-CBN shuts down, and some of its employees like singer Yeng Constantino have openly encouraged the President to reconsider his stance.

If Duterte agrees then good. If Duterte refuses then everythings up to Gabby Lopez.

Regardless of the Presidents justification for his aversion to franchise renewal, the reality is that Gabby Lopez is faced with two basic options that the President himself laid out:  hold on to ABS-CBN as it faces potential closure and hope for a last-minute miracle, or  sell it to somebody else.

Will Gabby Lopez consider Dutertes stance as fait accompli and sell his prized possession if only to save thousands of jobs, or will he bring thousands of his employees along with him as his company goes down?

#2019SEAGames: Fact-checking Marlon Ramos' Inquirer expos vs BCDA,"Inquirer reporter Marlon Ramos, on the 02 December 2019 article Deal to construct P13-B govt complex, sports hub at New Clark City questioned, said that based on documents, Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and Malaysian MTD Capital Berhad (MTD) entered into an anomalous deal.

The deal in question is the New Government Administrative Center (NGAC) and Sports Complex project in New Clark City in Tarlac, i.e., the same sports complex used today for the 2019 SEA Games.

Lets analyze.


BCDA-MTD Agreement OKd despite OGCC objections
Ramos wrote, ""BCDA signed a joint-venture agreement with MTD despite getting an adverse legal opinion issued by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) in early 2018, records showed.

Ramos then quoted former OGCC head Rudolf Philip Jurado, who issued a 30 January 2018 legal opinion stating that the NGACs Sports Complex segment as a rule should both be subject to public bidding. 

former OGCC head Rudolf Jurado
Note that the entire writeup doesnt contain any direct quote from the supposed records and documents, and the same documents werent embedded in the article either, so I cannot check if Ramos understood the document correctly, or if he based his article on flawed understanding.

I have written exposs since 2015, some of which were used as resource material for congressional hearings and police/NBI investigations. As a rule, I provide the source document, especially if its publicly available in the first place. That way, readers can verify for themselves the accuracy of my observations.

Ramos didnt do this, even if the credibility of his entire article depends on whats in this document.

I suspected that Ramos wasnt telling the whole story, especially because Jurado used the term as a rule, meaning that government projects usually go through to public bidding, but not all the time.

In short, exceptions exist. Hence, Ramos should have checked first if the Sports Complex falls under any of the legal exceptions or not, but he didnt.
Ramos reinforced my suspicion when he wrote, But [Jurado] said the construction of the NGAC had complied with government rules on joint-venture projects, with Jurado saying that the sports complex should be a part of the Joint Venture.

Hence, Ramos contradicted his entire hypothesis when the article states that no other than his primary source Jurado said the project is legally compliant.


If Ramos wanted to poke holes on the project and based on Jurados statement, Ramos shouldve checked if BCDA made the sports complex part of the BCDA-MTD joint venture.

Ramos even quoted Jurado as saying, It should be noted that the joint venture should cover the entire project and not only NGAC.

Did BCDA include the Sports Complex in the joint venture?

Thats what Ramos should have explored, but he didnt.

Ugh. Marlon.

Differing OGCC opinions
Ramos either misunderstood or worse, totally failed to understand the OGCC opinions.

As explained earlier, Jurados January 2018 opinion states that the sports complex project is compliant, with the caveat that it must be made part of the BCDA-MTD Joint Venture. Thus, the question is whether BCDA made it part of the Joint Venture or not.

BCDA President and CEO Vivencio ""Vince"" Dizon
In a 03 December 2019 press conference, Dizon said BCDA believed that we already addressed the concerns of the OGCC in the final joint venture agreement that was signed in February 2018.In response to this, BCDA made the business decision, which [it] is empowered to do under its charter [to] give due course to this (project).

In short, BCDA attempted to comply with the January 2018 OGCC opinion, and it believes it did. As to whether it complied, however, is another matter, so hold on to that thought for now.

After the clarifications were made, GOCC said, BCDA, tama ginawa niyo (you did right), Dizon said.

In the same presser, Government Corporate Counsel Justice Elpidio Vega seconded Dizons statement, when he said OGCC issued an October 2018 opinion affirming that BCDA complied with the conditions set in the earlier January 2018 opinion.

current OGCC head Elpidio Vega
Vega said, The contract review which was issued way back in January  was indeed not a negative opinion, but in fact, it approved and gave the go signal to BCDA. The only problem then was more on the modality on the procurement, and that was, however, explained expertly well by BCDA in going into the joint venture. We studied it, and we found that the same is a joint venture and has passed the rules and regulations regarding it. Thats why in October , we gave the affirmative opinion. I hereby confirm that the same is above-board, and we found no legal impediment to its execution.

The first opinion gave the go signal to BCDA, and in that instance, the BCDA is on the right track, Vega added.

That is, the January 2018 opinion, on which Ramos entire article was anchored, actually allowed BCDA to proceed, but on the condition that the sports facilities be made part of the BCDA-MTD Joint Venture Agreement. BCDA complied with the condition, and months later, OGCC said what BCDA did is correct.

In short, Marlon Ramos completely misunderstood the January 2018 opinion and proceeded to write fake news based on this colossal misunderstanding. 

Time Constraints
Dizon said the government was in a rush to build facilities for the 2019 SEA Games, given that it agreed to host the event only two years before schedule.

Dizon said, We were told that we needed to build facilities that we would need for the Southeast Asian Games. Remember that the proponent submitted a proposal without those sports facilities to be built. 

The New Clark City Athletics Stadium
It was BCDA who said, We need those sports facilities to be part of this because we will be hosting the 2019 Southeast Asian Games and we need those facilities post-haste. This was 2017, then 2018. You know how long it takes to construct a 20,000-seater stadium? Dizon added.

Dizon explained that BCDA had to start moving and building the facilities for the Philippines to avoid international embarrassment.

BCDA-MTDs Criminal Intent
Ramos also quoted an anonymous source that alleges criminal intent and intention to defraud the government, which is a pretty loaded accusation for an article containing zero documentary evidence.

Ramos wrote, The source said MTD used the Filipino peoples money to finance the project that would provide profits from three different sourcesthe original project cost, the reasonable costs and returns, and rental fees.

Ramos quoted the anonymous source as saying that the deal is certainly disadvantageous to the government.

New Clark Aquatic Center
MTD used the Filipino peoples money implies unjustly used public funds to finance the project.

We all know that foreign investors who come to Philippine shores are legally allowed to borrow from local banks. That isnt new.

MTD would have committed an injustice only if it ran away with the money, or if the loan got a sovereign guarantee, i.e., the government told the lender that it'd pay for the loan in case MTD fails to do so.

MTD is still here, and Ramos didnt provide proof that the loan has a sovereign guarantee.

BCDA President and CEO Vivencio Dizon, in the same presser, said the government did not guarantee the loan.

So how, exactly, was the loan unjust? Ramos didnt explain that.

That article is bad journalism, Marlon. That is bad journalism.

To make matters worse, the claim that BCDA and MTD are cheating the government is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Ramos evidence was just an anonymous source. Ramos took a gargantuan leap of logic, possibly out of the need to meet his articles deadline. Yes, Ramos source said the deal is anomalous, but Marlon didnt even bother to ask the anonymous source HOW EXACTLY it is so.

What does a responsible journalist do when his article is still half-baked and the deadline is at hand? 

A responsible journalist DOES NOT submit that half-baked article and submits something else instead. 

But I guess half-baked articles are good enough for the Inquirer.",RJ Nieto,"December 3, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/12/2019seagames-fact-check-marlon-ramos-bcda-mtd-berhad.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake

Pero bakit dadagdagan pa ang gastusin ng bayan via more 8 additional deputy speakers ngayong House na 'to e pwede naman ilagay na lang ang pondo sa mga priority projects ni PRRD?

Health, education, social services, infra, disaster relief... ang daming pwedeng paglagyan ng pera pero bakit sa walang bagong deputy speaker ibibigay?

Yun ang problema ko.

Cayetano reacts
Nag-react si Speaker Cayetano via personal attacks, na kesyo fake news lang raw yung banat ng a certain blogger at may axe to grind o sama ng loob lang yon sa kanya.

Dahil diumanoy may sama ng loob sa kanya yung blogger na yon e wala na dapat tanong-tanong sa P1.6 billion, GANERN?

Maraming puwedeng mabili ang P1.6 billion: Gamot, classroom, sweldo ng nars at teacher, ang haba-haba ng listahan. Ang dami-daming priority project ni Pangulo ang kulang ng pondo kaya hindi biro ang P1.6 billion.

Pero in fairness, medyo nahimasmasan si Speaker Cayetano sa ibang mga interview.

Doon sa isa, sinabi niyang ang big chunk ng P1.6 billion e pupunta sa various projects, pero di niya sinabi kung magkano ang big chunk at kung ano mismo yung various projects. 



Doon naman sa isa pa, sinabi niyang gagamitin raw ang P1.6 billion para sa research, adding, whats one-billion that will be added to Congress to make sure that the P4.1-trillion is spent very well?

Pero talaga, P1.6 billion para sa research? Ang total budget nga ng PAGASA, for 2019 e P1.6 billion lang, tapos tila may budget cut pa sa 2020 kasi 1.4 billion lang ang proposed. Tapos ang research budget ng House, P1.6 billion? 

P1.4 billion lang ang proposed total budget ng PAGASA for 2020.
So mas mahalaga na magpondo ng additional deputy speakers kaysa taasan ang sweldo ng mga meteorologist natin sa PAGASA na isa-isa nang lumalayas sa bansa dahil sa baba ng suweldo?                                                                                                                   
Tulad nang paliwanag sa huling Thinking Pinoy article, karapatan ng bawat taxpayer na manghingi ng accountability mula sa mga public servant, at kasama na roon ang kasapi ng House of Representatives.

Pero dahil ayaw nilang sumagot ng diretso sa request for an itemization, nagkusa na akong humanap ng paraan para mas malaman ang punot dulo ng issue.

Walang itemization? Walang itemization!
As explained in a previous Thinking Pinoy article, ang hinihingi ko e mas malinaw na itemization ng kung saan gagastusin ang dagdag na P1.6 billion, at so far e maliit lang naman ang description na kayang ibigay ni Speaker Cayetano tungkol sa kung magkano ang pupunta sa mga bagong imbento niyang walong deputy speakerships.

Kung sinagot lang niya ako ng diretso e di ok na, tapos na ang drama, pero hindi e. Simple lang naman na i-scan niya yung itemization at i-post online pero hindi magawa?

So sige, i-try nating hanapin ang itemization na yan. Pero heto muna ang basics.

Ang 2020 National Budget ay informal term para sa 2020 General Appropriations Act, na dahil hindi pa naisasabatas e tinatawag pang General Appropriations Bill (GAB), filed as House Bill 4228.

Ipinasa ng House ang final nilang version ng GAB noon 20 September 2019 at dadalhin ito sa Senado para busisiin naman ng mga senador. Kasama sa GAB ang budget ng lahat ng government agencies pero karaniwang hindi pinakikialaman ng Senado ang proposed budget ng House bilang parliamentary courtesy.

In short, yung final proposed House Budget na nakapaloob sa GAB ang pinakamalamang na maging House Budget for 2020, aside from the fact na iyon mismo ang nais na budget ng House.

Ilang araw nang offline ang website ng House (congress.gov.ph) kaya hindi ko ma-download ang GAB, at coincidentally(?) e parang nag-offline siya simula nang pumutok ang butsi ng Speaker. Nag-up siya kani-kanina lang, pero hindi pa rin ma-download yung text ng HB 4228.

So bilang workaround, humingi ako ng hard copy mula sa mga little birds ko sa HoR. Napakahigpit raw ng pag-release ng kopya pero buti naman at naparaanan nila, at eto yong dokumentong pinakahanap-hanap ko, ang final version ng House Bill 4228, ang General Appropriations Bill for 2020.

Kalkalan na, mga friendships!

The Proposed House Budget for 2020
Makikita ang 2020 House Budget sa Volume I-A pages 9 to 11, na filed under I. Congress of the Philippines; D. House of Representatives.

Medyo simple lang para makita kung nasaan ang P1.6 billion: ikumpara ang mga line item amounts sa 2020 House Budget doon sa same na line item amount noong 2019 na budget.

Narito ang scan ng proposed 2020 House Budget na nakapaloob sa National Budget:

HB 4228 - 2020 General Appr... by ThinkingPinoy on Scribd

Para naman sa previous budgets, click here for the 2019 House Budget at click here for the 2018 House Budget.

Para mas madaling makita, gumawa ako ng side-by-side comparison ng mga line item amounts, at sa dulo e kinompyut ko ang difference. Kinulayan ko na rin ng red kung bumaba ang amount, green naman kung tumaas, at orange kung walang nagbago.

Unahin natin ang overview:


Makikita ritong tataas ng P1.32 billion ang total 2020 House budget kumpara sa 2019.

Malinaw na rito na may paglaki nga ng budget, pero bakit hindi P1.6 billion tulad nang sinabi ni Cong. Tolentino?

Tingnan pa natin ng mas maigi.

Three Basic Categories ng Line Items
May tatlong basic categories ng mga line items sa budget:  Personnel Services,  Capital Outlays at  Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE).

Pag sinabing Personnel Services, we mean yung mga pasweldo sa empleyado, allowances, bonuses, at pati na rin yung mga pambayad sa SSS, Pag-ibig, PhilHealth, etc.
Pag sinabi namang Capital Outlay, we mean yung pambili ng mga fixed assets tulad ng opisina, upuan, pang-construction, at iba pang property ng House.
Pag sinabi namang MOOE, e halo-halo na yon. Lahat ng hindi kasama sa unang dalawang basic categories, shinu-shoot dito sa MOOE.

Tingnan ang susunod na table (note that figures in the succeeding tables are in 000s, so i-multiply niyo by 1000 lahat, e.g. 92,976 means 92,976,000):



As you can see, BUMABA ng P173.2 million ang personnel services o yung total na pondong pang-employee benefits. Note na WALANG capital outlay for 2020, so walang pondong panggawa o pangkumpuni ng bagong opisina o pambili ng bagong equipment.

Pero kung sabi ni Speaker Cayetano sa Rappler, the extra P1.6 billion will fund salary increases for House workers, bakit yung line item ng pasweldo para sa plantilla e bumaba tapos hindi naman nagbago ang total allotment for contractuals?

Parang may mali? I know, so tingnan natin ng mas mabuti.

Inamin mismo ni Speaker Cayetano sa Rappler na may pondo para sa mga bagong posisyon at ayon naman kay Rep. Tolentino e hindi biro ang halaga na gugugulin para pondohan ang mga bagong posisyong ito. Di ba ngat sabi mismo ng the House Accounts Committeee chair in the same GMA News interview:
There are a lot of increase(s) in the expenses for 2020 for equipment, new offices for additional deputy speakers, and a lot of expenses really.
So kung may increase, nasaan? Yan ang tanong ngayon.

What are Savings?
May isang Special Provisions clause doon sa GAB Vol I-A page 13 that partly reads:
Augmentation of any item in the appropriations of the Congress of the Philippines. xxx [T]he Speaker, with respect to the House of Representatives, are hereby authorized to augment any item for their respective offices from any savings in other items


Tataglishin ko:
Pagdaragdag sa kahit anong item sa budget ng Congress. xxx Ang Speaker, with respect sa House, ay maaaring magdagdag sa kahit anong item para sa kanilang ahensiya mula sa mga savings sa ibang items...
Pag may walong bagong deputy speaker, may karagdagang staff rin ang mga yon, di ba? Papayag ba ang isang karaniwang congressman na magsisante ng sariling tauhan para magkaroon ng financial space for the additional staffing needs ng mga bagong deputy speaker?

Kung popondohan ni Speaker ang mga bagong posisyon pero nagbawas pa siya ng pondo for personnel services and capital outlay, so tama bang sabihin na magre-realign ng budget?

There you go.

Saan kukuha ng savings?
Both yung 2019 National Budget (na batas na) at 2020 National Budget (na proposal pa) ay may clause regarding Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations, which reads:
Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations. Unexpended quarterly and year-end balances of approved appropriations for xxx House of Representatives xxx shall remain valid appropriations and shall continue to be available until fully spend and shall remain under their control and accountability...

I-taglish ko:
Ang mga hindi nagastos na quarterly at year-end balance ng mga inaprubahang gastusin para sa House ay mananatiling valid at available hanggang maubos at mananatiling nasa kanilang control at pananagutan
Malaking issue yung sinasabing absorptive capacity ng isang agency dahil karaniwang mababalewala ang budget allocation nito na hindi magagamit within the fiscal year.
Halimbawa, kung may 100 pesos ang DPWH pero 80 pesos lang ang nagastos sa buong taon, balewala na ang natitirang 20 pesos at kailangan na nitong maghintay for the next national budget.
Hindi ganoon sa House.

Yung mga hindi nagastos sa House Budget from the previous year, nake-carry over to the current year. Ibig sabihin, kung may nilaan P1 billion for a certain project na hindi na itinuloy, puwedeng gastusin pa rin ang P1 billion na iyon bilang savings sa susunod na taon o hanggang maubos ito.

Okey lang sana kung lehitimong hindi natuloy ang proyekto pero hindi laging ganon e.

Parang DAP ni PNoy?
Tingnan niyo yung unconstitutional na Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) nina dating Pangulong Noynoy Aquino at dating DBM Sec. Butch Abad.

Ang ginawa nila e tahasang HINDI GINAGASTOS ang budget at dinedeclare na savings para mai-realign nila kung saan nila gusto. Yung Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund (MPBF), hindi nila ginamit nina PNoy para sa benepisyo ng mga govt employees at sa halip e ni-realign ang MPBF para pambili ng Dengvaxia.

Remember what Senator Richard Gordon said in 2017 about Dengvaxia ?


In short, ang ""DAP technique"" e yung mangangako ka na gagamitin ang pondo para sa isang bagay, pero sa huli e gagastusin mo pala para sa iba.

Parang yung binigyan ka ng nanay mo ng baon para pambili ng lunch sa eskwela, pero di mo ginastos, tinawag mong savings, at pinanlaro mo sa ng DotA sa kompyuteran. Ganern na ganern.

Dineklara ng Supreme court na unconstitutional na ang DAP technique pero mukhang naiwasan ng Kongreso ang pagbabawal na ito dahil sa Availability of Appropriations and Cash Allocations clause ng National Budget, na parang ginagawang exempted sa SC DAP ruling ang Kongreso.

In short, kung may hindi nagastos (or sadyang hindi ginastos) na 2019 House budget, puwede pang gastusin ito ng House sa 2020, on top of the 2020 House Budget.

Medyo tumaas nga ang kilay ko diyan kasi ilang buwan nang hindi sumusuweldo ang maraming contractuals sa House at nagkasibakan na ng mga maintenance staff, tapos binawasan pa ang pasweldo House budget for 2020?
Kasama kaya ang 2019 pasweldo ng mga ito sa gagawing savings ng House na maaaring irealign?
With that said, may dalawa lang akong nakikitang puwedeng pagkuhanan ng Savings para pondohan ang mga karagdagang deputy speaker:

Allocations from 2019 House Budget na hindi nagamit, hindi ginamit, o planong hindi gamitin sa 2019, at,
Realignment ng items mula sa proposed 2020 budget.

Kung may pang ibang pagkukunan, please enlighten me, pero after several hours ng paghahanap ng paraan, iyang dalawa lang na yan ang malinaw kong nakikitang source.

Heres where it gets more interesting.

Deciphering the Accounts Chair
Yung savings from unspent items in 2019? Any self-respecting finance professional should have at least a ballpark idea kung magkano aabutin niyan dahil nakalantad na ang 2019 House Budget.

Dapat, alam na yan nina Speaker, di ba?

For one, may confidential-intelligence funds worth P1.07 billion si Speaker Cayetano under the 2019 House budget, or P392 million more than Speaker Arroyos 2018 intel funds worth P 615 million.
Malaking halaga ang diprensiya ng confidential funds nila pero Arroyo was able to survive with just P615 million, so assuming na the ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano can, like Arroyo, get things done using the same amount, e di may P392 million na pwedeng laru-laruin si Speaker Cayetano, tama ba?
If the Cayetano-led House has a rough idea of how much savings will exist by end of 2019, and despite that knowledge e sinabi pa rin ng House Accounts na kulang ang pera kasi hindi expected ang deputy speakerships, so saan kukuha ng karagdagan?

E di sa 2020 budget, tama ba?

Pero... Pero... Pero...
Pero di ba ngat ayon sa proposed 2020 House Budget, bumagsak ang pasweldo sa House plantilla and contractuals, at wala ring allocated for capital outlay, so saan balak kunin ng House leadership ang pampondo doon sa mga bagong deputy speaker, bagong vice-chairmanships, at bagong kumite?

Isa lang ang nakikita ko: MOOE.

Shown below ang breakdown ng Maintenance and Other Operating expenses (MOOE) under New Appropriations by Object of Expenditures:


Makikitang 17 out of the 19 line items sa MOOE e kapareho lang noong isang taon: walang dagdag, walang bawas... pero makikita ring may dalawang lumaki:

""Utility expenses increased by P13 million (P254.6-M vs P245.5-M)
""Professional Services"" increased by P1.64 billion (P4.13-B vs 2.49-B).

Mapapatawad na siguro yung increase sa utility expenses (bills for Meralco, Manila Water, etc.) dahil ayoko naman mapulutan ng kuryente ang batasan, pero kagulat-gulat na P1.64 billion ang increase para sa Professional Services.
Katunog ba siya noong P1.6 billion na binanggit sa balita?
Pwede bang i-lump sum na lang ang P1.64 billion nang ganun-ganun na lang? Kwestiyonable na nga ang P2.49 billion na lump sum for ""Professional Services"" sa 2019 pero talagang kailangan pang sagarin by adding P1.64 billion more (P4.13 billion na ang total) for 2020?

Kung oo, bakit hindi itemized ang mga gastusin at sa halip e lump sum lang? Kung itemized kasi yan, mas malinaw sa taumbayan at sa iba pang mga congressman kung ano ang maaasahang pondo.

Pero kung ganyang lump sum na ire-realign lang, malinaw sa GAB na largely e nasa kamay ng House Speaker ang desisyon kung paano ito gagastusin, tama ba?

The Dangers of Lump Sums
Ilatag ko muna ang analysis diyan at feel free to correct me if Im wrong:

FIRST, ayon mismo sa House Accounts chair, maraming dagdag-gastos dahil sa pag-create ng walong bagong deputy speakerships, bagong commitees, at bagong vice-chairmanships, at hindi nila raw ito expected.

SECOND, may estimate naman ng magiging savings from 2019 at make-carry over ang savings sa 2020, pero sa kabila nito e nagpasya pa rin ang House na magdagdag ng P1.6 billion.

THIRD, sa kabila ng karagdagang gastos e nagbawas pa ang House ng budget para sa pasweldo ng tao at pambili ng equipment, so logic dictates na kailangan ng realignment ng funds from MOOE to personnel services and/or capital outlay.

Given these, heto ang critical na tanong:
Bakit hindi na lang inallocate agad under ""Personnel Services"" o ""Capital Outlay"" ang dagdag na pondo at sa halip e ginawang lump sum under MOOE - Professional Services?
Kung inallocate agad, e di alam na natin kung paano magagastos.

Pero hindi, ginawang lump sum e... lump sum na ang suma total e P4.13 billion na kung gusto ng speaker e pwedeng gamitin for something else na huhulaan na lang natin kung ano, tama ba?

Kahit nga si DepEd Sec. Briones, noong nagsusulat siya tungkol sa lump sums sa Aquino-era budget, na:
All of us know that in the human physical system, presence of lumps is a danger signal.
Let me rephrase the question.
If the ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano intends to spend the P1.6 billion for research, new positions, new offices, and oversight, then why didnt he split the P1.6 billion into four line items? Is it fair to ask why such a gigantic amount appears to be at the mercy of the House Speaker?
Just how much money is in Cayetanos hands?
Judging from his many media interviews so far,  sobrang evasive ni Cayetano pag tinatanong about the budget, kaya wala tayong choice kundi tumingin na lang sa dokumento at mag-deduce mula sa mga iyon.
Hindi naman ako perfectionist. Okey na sa akin yung palusutin ang kaunting ""leakages"" pero wag naman sanang itodo nang bonggang-bongga dahil nakakahiya naman sa taumbayan dahil my gahd I heyt drahgs!
Going back to topic, tulad ng 2020 proposed House Budget ay may identical na DAP-like clauses ang 2018 at 2019 House Budget, i.e.  pwedeng may 2018 funds na carried over to 2019 at 2019 to 2020. Pero partidahan na natin ang 2019 House at sabihing zero savings from last year, i.e. sinimot ni Gloria ang 2018 House Budget.
Actually, mukhang nasimot nga talaga ni Speaker Arroyo ang funds nila noong 2018, as suggested by screenshot ng Notes to Financial Statements sa 2018 CoA Report on the House:


So sige, sabihin na lang natin na walang na-carry over na funds from 2018.

Sa kabila ng assumption na ito, tumaas pa rin ang kilay ko nang makita ang 2019 House Budget dahil may P1.07 billion na confidential funds pala ang House Speaker for 2019.

Confidential funds yung pondong halos walang accounting, i.e. pork barrel ng Speaker, di ba?
Partida, hindi pa kasama diyan ang mga pwedeng i-realign ng Speaker from the 2019 House Budget basta at kung gugustuhin niya.

2019 GAA shows Speaker Cayetano got P1.07 billion in confidential funds, or about Php 392 million more than the P615 million his predecessor had in 2018.
Ganito kasi yan. Hindi naman kasalanan ni Cayetano na P1.07 billion ang confidential funds niya for 2019 dahil hindi naman siya kasama sa mga nagpasa niyan. In short, congratulations para kay Speaker Cayetano dahil nachambahan niya ang ganyang ka-bonggang 2019 slush fund.

Pero ngayong House ""Speaker na Tapat"" na siya, bakit siya humihingi ng P1.07 billion ulit for 2020, tulad ng natanggap niya ngayong 2019?


Yun pa nga lang P1.07 billion na pwedeng laruin ni Speaker Cayetano for 2019, nakapagtataka na kasi P615 million lang ang allocated sa previous na speaker. Pero imbes na babaan ni ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano ang confidential funds niya for 2020, inulit lang niya ang P1.07 billion?

House Speaker Gloria Arroyo, who Cayetano accused as corrupt, had only P615 million in confidential funds for 2018.
Aanhin kaya ni Speaker Cayetano ang ganoong kalaking pera samantalang si Gloria, na pinaratangang kurakot ni Cayetano, e nakatiis sa P615 billion lang?
Mas marami pang magagastos na public funds si ""Speaker na Tapat"" Cayetano kaysa sa tinawag niyang kurakot?
Pero hindi pa nakuntento sa P1.07 billion kaya dinagdagan pa ng P1.64 billion na lump sum, ganon ba?


Kung may extra P1.64 billion na lump sum sa loob ng Professional Services ang 2020 House Budget, at idagdag pa natin ang reinstated na P1.07 billion na confidential funds ng House Speaker, e di may hindi bababa sa 1.07 + 1.6 = 2.67 billion na pwedeng laruin ang House Speaker sa 2020 at bukod pa yan sa at least P1.07 billion na nilalaro na niya ngayong 2019, tama ba?

Tama bang sabihing si Speaker Cayetano ay may 1.07 + 1.07 + 1.64 = 3.78 billion na combined outright and de facto na slush funds?

Aanhin niya ang lahat ng public funds na yun ng isang ""Speaker na Tapat""?
Hindi ba't pag ""Speaker na Tapat"" e mas matipid dapat?
If he's an honest Speaker, at kurakot sabi niya ang last speaker, di ba dapat e mas matipid siya?

E bakit balde-balde ang inilaki ang hawak ni Speaker Cayetano na Pera ng Bayan samantalang kinaya naman ng isang kurakot na suportahan ang pangulo sa hamak na mas mababang halaga?

May dagdag-bayad ba pag ""Speaker na Tapat""?

Matutupad ba ang term-sharing deal?
Recall na mayroong  gentlemans agreement between Cayetano and Rep. Velasco na term-sharing, kung saan ""Speaker na Tapat"" daw si Cayetano for the 1st 15 months tapos si Velasco sa remaining 21 months.

Pero kung bubusisiin ang budget ng Kongreso, parang may hindi nagtutugma.

Heto't pasadahan natin ng isang mabilis-bilis.

Despite increased costs arising from the new positions created under Cayetano (8 deputy speakerships, new committees, new vice-chairmanships), bumaba ang nakalaang pondo para sa pasweldo ng tauhan at pambili ng property and equipment, pero hindi naman siguro papayag ang mga kongresista sa budget cut, di ba?

That means Cayetano will fund these new positions via realignment, right?

At kung realignment technique na gagamitin, ibig non e dapat sumipsip ang karaniwang kongresista kay Cayetano para tuparin niya ang realignment, tama?
Alam niyo naman ang ""Speaker na Tapat"" na si Cayetano pag nagtampo, parang batang inagawan ng kendi, as illustrated by his juvenile response (Boo-hoo! Axe to grind!) sa questions about the extra P1.6 billion budget, di ba?
Kung blogger pa lang ba bumira sa kanya tapos e nagkaganyan nam paano pa kung kongresista na hawak ng ""Speaker na Tapat"" sa leeg?

Kung kongresista ka at hawak ng ""Speaker na Tapat""  sa leeg ang budget ng opisina mo, paano gagawin mo pag matatapos na ang 15 months at magbobotohan na for a new speaker, maging ang new speaker man e si Lord Alan Velasco o si Martin Romualdez o kahit pa yung mga baliw-baliwang pulang party-list?
Matatapos ang 15 months ni Speaker Cayetano sa umpisa ng October 2020, which is the year kung saan gagamitin ang budget na kinekwestiyon natin ngayon.

Kung ako'y isang gahaman na speaker at meron akong bilyon-bilyon na pwedeng paglaruan, sisiguraduhin kong mabibili ko ang loyalty ng kahit kalahati man lang ng House para sigurado akong hindi ako matatanggal bilang Speaker.

Kung mayroon akong 2 billion, at kailangan kong manligaw ng 150 na kongresista, e di alam ko na ang gagawin. #AlamNaThis

Sa palagay ko, hindi naman baliw si Cayetano na mag-asam pa ng presidency sa 2022 kasi ngayon pa nga lang e President of the House pa lang e hirap na hirap na siya.

If I were in Caytanos shoes, Id be more interested in keeping the House Speakership, dahil far more realistic at immediate yon kaysa presidente ng Pilipinas.

Correct me if I'm wrong but with a possible P2.74 billion na slush fund (at idagdag pa P1.07 intel funds for 2019), he has around P3.81 billion (or even more) at his disposal from now until the time na kailangan nang mag-botohan ng bagong speaker, tama?

What will Cayetano do with those billions?
If Speaker Cayetano wants to keep true to his promise na hell be an honest speaker, then why didnt he itemize the budget and instead allowed a lump sum na P1.64 billion to be added, a lump sum that he, if he so wishes, can be realigned to pretty much wherever he wants?

Kung may 1.07 billion times two ako na confidential funds, ano ba naman yung maglaan ako ng kapiraso noon para sa social media counter-attack?

Will Cayetano suddenly mature, stop being a crybaby like when he threatened Inday Sara na sisirain niya ang Duterte Coalition kung susuportahan ni Inday si Velasco, and allow the next speaker to take over?

Will Cayetano suddenly mature, stop being a crybaby like when he didnt mind attacking a woman to further his political goals (as exposed by Pulong Duterte), and allow the next speaker to take over?

Will Cayetano be so honest that he will NEVER use his bilions in intel funds (P1.07 billion times 2) and other de facto slush funds just to stay as speaker?

We, as taxpayers, deserve an answer.

Pero siyempre, hindi magagawa ni Cayetano na manloko ng taumbayan kasi nga, di ba, ""Speaker na Tapat"" siya?",RJ Nieto,"October 2, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/10/i-saw-speaker-na-tapat-cayetanos-2020.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"EXTRA P1.6-B HOUSE BUDGET: CAYETANOS NEGATIVE PREGNANT DEFENSE VS ""FAKE NEWS""","Let's thoroughly dissect the House budget issue and Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano's excruciatingly problematic defense. Nililihis ang istorya e. Akala siguro e makalulusot.

On 20 Sept 2019, House Accounts Committee chair and Cavite Rep. Bambol Tolentino told GMA News that that the House seeks P1.6-billion on top of its original proposed P14-billion budget for 2020. 

Tolentino said:
We did not expect that there will be additional Deputy Speaker; we did not expect that there will be additional vice chairpersons on [House Committees] on Appropriations and Ways and Means; we did not expect either that there will be newly created committees We are talking about all the employees, over 4,000, including those who are in a contractual status, permanents and other employees.
I found this alarming on several grounds

FIRST, WHY NEED FOR MORE EXPENSIVE DEPUTY SPEAKERSHIPS?
The sheer number of deputy speakers as the House had only:
ONE deputy speaker from 1946 to 1995
TWO deputy speakers from 1995 to 1998
FOUR to SIX deputy speakers from 1998 to 2016
FOURTEEN deputy speakers from 2016 to 2019
While there was a radical increase of deputy speakers during the 17th Congress under the leadership of Speaker Bebot Alvarez (and subsequently, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo), I was willing to tolerate it given that PRRD really had to curry the favor of the House.


The Liberal Party was the single biggest power bloc in the 300-member 2016 House. Given that the President had a lot on his legislative agenda that needed massive congressional support, I understood and recognized the political reality that he needs to bring them to his side, hence the jump from six deputy speakers in the 16th Congress to fourteen in the 17th.

Come 2019, however, the Presidents own PDP-Laban (where PRRD belongs) and Nacionalista (where Speaker Cayetano belongs) dominated the elections with 94 and 37 congressional seats each. Adding the generally pro-administration NPCs 33 seats and NUPs 28 seats, the total number of administration-aligned congressmen is 192, a clear supermajority.

Alvarez in 2016 increased the number of deputies by 8 (from 6 to 14) because most of the solons are anti-administration. That I would understand because I recognize political realities.

And in fairness to the 17th Congress, their performance is far better than their predecessors, in as far as supporting the Presidents legislative agenda.

But unlike 2016, a pro-administration supermajority already won in 2019, so what necessitated Cayetanos decision to add eight more (from 14 to 22)?

It wouldve been understandable if Cayetano merely retained the 14 deputy speakership positions from the last Congress, but why did he need to create eight more?

While were at it, I would not have cared if Cayetano made deputy speakers out of all the 300 solons if not for the fact that each deputy speaker requires additional funds that come from guess what?

PUBLIC FUNDS. Public funds that couldve been used for healthcare, agriculture, education, infrastructure and social services instead or public funds that couldve been saved to minimize the countrys ballooning budget deficit.
This is issue is quite similar to the Dengvaxia Scandal.Was P3.5 billion for an experimental vaccine the best use of public funds? Similarly, is P1.6 billion additional House budget the best use of public funds?
SECOND, 11-B WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO WHY 4.6-B MORE?
The 17th Congress under Speakers Alvarez and Arroyo were able to pass ALL of PRRDs legislative measures with a 2018 budget of just Php 11 billion. If the that House can accomplish the task with that amount, why do we have to increase it?

As shown in a 03 June 2019 infographic posted in Thinking Pinoy, the House of Representatives under GMA (and predecessor Alvarez) passed ALL of PRRD's 28 priority bills... and they had only a P11-B budget in 2018.

Fine, theres inflation, so lets say we should increase the House budget by 10% annually to neutralize rising costs, but that means that the 2019 budget must be only Php 12.1 billion, and 2020 only Php 13.31 billion.

The House, according to Rep. Tolentino, initially asked for Php 14 billion and I think that I can tolerate the extra Php 690 million on top of Php 13.31 billion projection. However, what I do not understand is why the House had to increase the budget even further, to the tune of P1.6 billion pesos.

Again, if Alvarez and Gloria whose House was initially anti-PRRD were able to pass all needed laws with just Php 11 billion, why does Cayetano, whose House is overwhelmingly pro-PRRD, asking for Php 14 billion + Php 1.6 billion  Php 11 billion = Php 4.6 billion more?

Speaker Cayetano, the House today are already allies, so why did you feel the need for more political accommodations?

THIRD, BREAKING DOWN THE P1.6-B
Recall that Rep. Tolentino, who handles House finances, said the P1.6-B will be to fund the following:
new deputy speakerships
new committees
new vice-chairs, and
employee salaries.
Now, if there are X employee positions in 2019, then the House in preparing its 2020 budget must take into account salaries for those X number of employee positions, regardless of whos occupying them. That is, the initial P14-B must already take into account the salary expenses of the current set of positions.

In short, we could only surmise that the employee salaries that Tolentino mentioned are for NEW regular and contractual positions. That is, logic dictates that the P1.6-B is intended for:
NEW deputy speakerships
NEW committees
NEW vice-chairs, and
NEW employees.
NEW. NEW. NEW. NEW. Yes, thats four NEWs out of four.

This brings us back to the second point. The Arroyo-Alvarez House managed to pass ALL of PRRDs legislative measures WITHOUT these NEW positions, and they passed the measures so fast the Philippine Star even accused the Arroyo-Alvarez House of being the rubber stamp of Malacaang.

If P11-B 2018 House budget can already buy what the Star calls a rubber stamp congress, what necessitated the extra 4.6?

I can smell only one thing: political accommodation.

Again, political accommodation, while ideally reprehensible, is in my opinion tolerable if done at the minimum but where does Cayetano draw the line?
 
CAYETANOS NEGATIVE PREGNANT REBUTTAL
The initial GMA News report was on 20 September 2019, and Cayetano encountered an avalance of criticisms shortly thereafter.

Responding to criticisms over the P1.6 billion issue, Speaker Cayetano said:
For the past two days, may mga nangungulit about, actually fake news 'yung nasa isang blogger na sinabi niyang we added P1.6 billion for the 22 deputy speakers. We used to have 14 deputy speakers, we now have 22. If we're going to add P1.6 billion for additional 8 deputy speakers, that's P200 million for every deputy speaker Ang problema sa blogger na 'to  aside from [having an] axe to grind sa akin  hindi man lang tiningnan 'yung actual records ng Congress or 'yung news.
Lets dissect Cayetanos problematic response. Note that you must already know who that blogger is.

Despite the typically verbose speaking style, Speaker Cayetano said only two things:
That the blogger is criticizing him only because the former has an axe to grind.
Its not true that each new deputy speaker will get Php 200 million.
The first statement is nothing but a personal attack that is unbecoming of a government official. The same issue is being raised by OTHER people, including his predecessor DFA Sec. Perfecto Yasay.

Speaker Cayetano, act with the dignity of someone in your position, and recognize your responsibility to the Filipino People, the same Filipino People who are funding your politics. If you can't be civil and professional when facing criticisms, you do not deserve to be there.


As for the second point, what we see here is a clear case of a negative pregnant statement, which is extremely disappointing because Cayetanos a lawyer who should know better than a college dropout blogger hes referring to.
The Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute defines a negative pregnant statement as a denial of wrongdoing done by denying only an aspect of the allegation, but not the allegation itself.
Cayetano issued an invalid denial. As explained in the previous sections:
The primary criticism against the extra P1.6-B budget is its apparent lack of necessity.
The secondary criticism is that it will be used to fund new positions, especially the 8 new deputy speakerships.
Hence, a valid denial must:
Decisively show that the P1.6-B is necessary to further PUBLIC AND NOT PERSONAL INTERESTS.
That the amounts allocated for the new positions are reasonable in light of the fact that other government spending priorities (education, healthcare, etc) could have gotten the funding instead.
But instead of addressing the issue head-on, Speaker Cayetano tried to weasel his way out by misrepresenting the criticism and rebutting the same misrepresentation.
Cayetano said P200-million-for-each-deputy is incorrect, but he didnt say exactly how much will go to them. If each new deputy gets only 199 million, then 200 million is indeed incorrect, right?

But would that make everything fine? Hell no. 

CAYETANOS MEDIA BLITZ
To be fair to Cayetano, he attempted to expound on the budget issue as seen in other news reports later that day. The problem, however, is he still dodged the core questions.

In an UNTV report, Cayetano said that of the P1.6-B additional budget, the big chunk is for various projects while only a little portion is for deputy speakers.


Cayetano didnt define what big and little means. So how much, exactly?

Lawyers like Speaker Cayetano are trained to be instinctively precise with their wording, so his resorting to such ambiguous terms is surprising, to say the least.

This is P1.6-B of public money were talking about, and the best adjectives he can come up with is big and little?

How much, Speaker Cayetano, EXACTLY how much? You love quoting the Bible but you can't even quote official congressional records that are already at your fingertips?
In another report from the Inquirer, Cayetano said:
So, whats one-billion na idadagdag mo sa (that will be added to) Congress to make sure that the 4.1-trillion is spent very well?
But this statement merely complicates Cayetanos predicament. 


Cayetano has not even sufficiently explained the necessity behind the augmentation yet here he is weaseling his way out of the issue.

Speaker Cayetano, you spent an entire day yesterday just to talk, yet you didnt even find time to publish the itemized breakdown of the extra P1.6 billion youre asking for.

ITEMIZE them!
Legislators like you are so anal-retentive and obsessive-compulsive when scrutinizing the budget of the executive and judiciary, yet when it comes to defending your own budget,big chunk and little portion are good enough for you?
Whats one billion, you ask?
One billion... No... One-point-six billion pesos can save and improve a big number of little Filipino lives.
Classrooms. Public School Teachers. Government Doctors. Public Nurses. Reformation of Youth Offenders. Agricultural Subsidies. Drug Rehabilitation Centers. Supplies for the Police and Military. Public Information Systems. Airports. Roads. Bridges. Coast Guard Vesels to patrol the South China Sea. The list goes on and on.
Mr. Speaker, there are so many ways to spend the ""big"" Php 1.6 billion to directly benefit ""little"" Filipinos.
Seriously, Speaker Cayetano, what have the Filipino People done to deserve you?",RJ Nieto,"September 24, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/extra-p-1.6-b-house-budget-cayetano-deputy-speaker.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Perception in politics is as important as Reality,"Politics is a game of Perception where whats really taking place may be different from what the public thinks is happening, and anyone who enters the political arena should know this by heart. A public official, whether elective or appointive, should not only be qualified (Reality) but also look qualified (Perception).

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 07 September 2019].


To illustrate, US domestic support for the 2003 war in Iraq was possible after the Bush administration managed to make the public believe that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (Perception), even if it didnt (Reality), something that the no less than the Bush administration admitted years later but not before the US had taken over Iraq, killed Sadam, taken control of the countrys massive oil resources, and in the process left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead.

Form (Perception) is more important than substance (Reality) in the game of political survival, at least in the short- to medium-term. The sad reality in politics is that Perception takes precedence over Reality, and its the job of every public official to minimize the gap between the two.


Case Study: PCOO Asec. Mocha Uson


Lets consider the case of former Presidential Communications (PCOO) Assistant Secretary Margaux Mocha Uson.

With over five million followers, Uson was hands-down considered the most powerful politically inclined blogger. At an astronomically distant second was Thinking Pinoy of yours truly, which at the time had a measly 600,000 followers, or just about 12 percent of Usons.


Presumably in cognizance of her online supremacy, President Rodrigo Duterte made her PCOO assistant secretary for social media in May, 2017.


Even before her appointment, Uson was already a threat to mainstream medias long-held supremacy over political discourse, and her appointment only managed to amplify the threat. Media outlets relentlessly attacked her, pressuring her Malacaang peers (who are scared stiff of mainstream media) to keep a disproportionately healthy distance from her.

To be fair, its not like media totally had no reason to do so  Uson did commit numerous gaffes that can be (and were) used as excellent fodder for mainstream medias cannon, the cannon that was always aimed and ready to fire at her. For example, Usons Mayon sa Naga, Pepe-dede-ralismo, and sign language scandals did nothing but further alienate her from erstwhile staunch allies.


In fairness, Uson earnestly attempted to do her job well. Her uncanny ability to reach the masses (Reality), however, shouldve been supplemented by efforts to mitigate her negative image among her peers (Perception), especially those who have power over her. Her political success, after all, is contingent not only on her performance, but also on the cooperation she enjoys from other officials.

Uson eventually resigned from office to lodge a congressional bid, and it seems that her image as a political pariah in the Palace even spilled outside Malacaangs walls.

For one, Usons staunchest allies  the Cayetanos of Taguig  didnt even openly and actively support her unsuccessful congressional campaign in their home city, as evidenced by her AA Kasosyo snagging only 0.63 percent of the approximately 300,000 votes cast there. Did the Cayetanos exclude AA Kasosyo in their sample ballots because they see her inclusion as a net political liability?

Uson is undoubtedly very popular but AA Kasosyo was over 70,000 votes short of the cutoff after garnering only 120,000 votes nationwide, or less than 2% of her 5.8 million followers today.

The Case of Nicanor Faeldon and GCTA
Recently resigned Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon is another example of the chasm between Perception and Reality.

The President recently fired Faeldon and said in a mix of English and Tagalog, Faeldon has to go because Faeldon disobeyed my order I was trying to provide the fire extinguisher to erase the peoples doubts. No releases. If he said that then, it shouldve been over. The problem is he came up the next day with his statement with his statement with his own computation.

The President, an astute politician, was essentially trying to balance Reality with Perception.

The Reality is that the GCTA Law was enacted and implemented well before Duterte took office. In the absence of any amendment to the law or any court order, Faeldon had no choice but to help implement it in the same way Senator Leila de Lima did while still in DOJ.

The Duterte Administration is aware of this reality, as evidenced by Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarras earlier statement that convicted murderer Mayor Antonio Sanchez may benefit from GCTA just like any other convict.

But the GCTA issue two faces: legal (Reality) and public opinion (Perception). Duterte as Chief Executive had to balance his responsibility to execute the law and as a politician had to keep the public satisfied, hence his decision to put GCTA on hold.

Faeldon, instead of recognizing this glaring political necessity, ignored the Presidents orders and handled matters his own way and his glaring lack of public relations skills made the situation even worse.

Faeldon focused too much Reality and failed to sufficiently address Perception and that didnt sit well with a President who recognizes, in this situation, that Perception is just as important as Reality.

Hence Faeldons termination.",RJ Nieto,"September 14, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-perception-in-politics-is-as.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Personal advocacies and the ABCD of politics,"The relative political calm in the months after the May, 2019, elections has come to an end: sentence reductions for convicted felons, the SOGIE bill, South China Sea tensions, Death Penaltys revival, the Communist insurgencythe list goes on and on.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 31 August 2019].

I have my own take on each of these issues and I have been quite vocal on most of them through my Facebook page ThinkingPinoy. More than just promoting my own views through this column, however, I feel that its more important, at least for now, to help everyone get back on track by sharing with my readers the four principles I generally follow when I publicly speak my mind.

Dont get me wrong: I admit that I oftentimes fail to adhere to them, but I try to stick to them as best as I can. I think I am already done with the days when I approached issues with unbridled anger. After years of being in the public scene, I learned that moderation is key.

I noticed, throughout the years, that my efforts yielded better results whenever I seriously take into consideration the principles that Im about to list down.


First, Politics is Addition.
We live in a democracy where popular opinion is the primary determinant of political advocacies, i.e., advocates should be able to gain popular support. But just like what I tell my friends over and over, you cant convince someone to switch to your side if the first thing you do is piss him off.

A balanced mix of passion, knowledge, and compassion is crucial in every advocacy, and too much of one thing  and too little of another  can sabotage the entire endeavor. Advocates are passionate and theyre usually knowledgeable about the subject, but a lot of them fail because they forget that compassion is just as important, compassion not only for the ones theyre fighting for, but also to those who they are fighting against.

Proving to yourself that youre right is one thing, but making others see it the same way is an entirely different matter, and that leads us to


Second, Politics is Belonging.
Political debates are usually a zero-sum game, where one sides gain is the other sides loss and we all know that losses generate resentment, resentment that may rear its ugly head when the next political issue comes along.

We can avoid this by showing opponents that all of us are mostly on the same side. Advocates should appeal not to their opponents position, but to their interests. See how a policy proposal can benefit its opponents, and explain this to them. For policy proposal that seem to benefit a few, explain how benefitting a few will, even in the long run, benefit the majority.

Third, Politics is Compromise.
I know for a fact that I cannot get everything I want, and I believe the same holds true for everyone else. We all have differing political interests and the way to go forward is finding a way to set policies that optimally reconcile these clashing desires. No single law is perfect: law inherently is a compromise subscribed to by millions of citizens with different ways of viewing the world.

As Norman Vincent Peale once said, Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youll land among the stars. Advocates should learn that compromise is a core aspect of politics, and achieving a less-than-ideal outcome is so much better than maintaining the status quo.


Simply shocking the system into submission usually requires bloody revolutions, and Im not really fond of those gory stuff.

Societal advancement is a process of iterative development where a society adopts less-than-ideal solution after less-than-ideal solution, in the hope that these successive incremental improvements will allow it to go nearer to its ideal state of affairs.

The world is imperfect and it always will be, but we can make it less so.

Fourth, Politics is Divisive.
Most importantly, I find it really odd that even some political analysts decry the divisiveness of Philippine politics, when the fact of the matter is that politics by nature is divisive. Has there ever been a time in Philippine History when ALL political factions united as one? Even when our forefathers fought against Spanish colonization, divisiveness existed among our own ranks: Emilio Aguinaldo himself readily confessed that he ordered Andres Bonifacios execution.

Instead viewing the divisiveness of politics like its some sort of temporal anomaly, we need to see it as a democratic political reality, and the primary task of every self-proclaimed advocate is to minimize it, or its ill effects at least. Nobody can eliminate divisiveness, but we can take the divisiveness down a notch. Case in point is the latest trust and approval ratings of the sitting President.

I know some may accuse me of hypocrisy after reading this article, but even Hitler saying the moon is round doesnt make it flat.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-personal-advocacies-and-abcd-of.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Duterte Youths Cardema vs Comelecs Guanzon,"Over the past several weeks, weve been witness to the word war between former National Youth Commission and Duterte Youth party-list nominee Ronald Cardema and Comelec commissioner Rowena Guanzon, with the core issue being Cardemas eligibility as Duterte Youths first nominee.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 24 August 2019.]


Comelec on one hand sees Duterte Youth, as its name suggests, a youth sector party-list, so that the age limit on nominees (no older than 30 years by law) apply. The 34-year-old Cardema, meanwhile, argues that the party represents young professionals (yuppies), who are generally defined as professionals in their 20s or 30s.

Cardema has always been a controversial figure but the rift formally started in late May when Guanzon questioned Cardemas eligibility. This is after Duterte Youth petitioned to replace the five original nominees with a new set where Cardema is on top. The Comelec in early June approved the substitution but Guanzon in her dissenting opinion raised the age issue.

A media war happened afterward, and it escalated to new levels when Guanzon in a mid-July tweet published an alleged text threat along with the comment Who do you think sent this? Obviously. The public felt Guanzon was alluding to Cardema, an allegation Cardema swiftly denied.

The Comelec in early August cancelled Cardemas nomination on grounds of age.

A little later, Cardema accused Guanzon of extortion as he claimed she asked him for a large sum and the appointment of several officials. Guanzon shrugged off the allegations.

Cardema and Guanzon threatened to sue each other, with Cardema going the extra mile by blaming Guanzons tirades for making his relatives sick.

Cardema then publicly requested for the Palaces help, a request that the Palace swiftly denied.

Cardemas motion for reconsideration is still pending and he told this writer in a recent (and quite lengthy) phone conversation that he is still hopeful that it will be granted.

Guanzon, meanwhile, is on a roll. We have to give the commissioner some credit: she has a knack for zingers that Cardema sorely lacks.


All things considered, I cannot help but view the odds are stacked against Cardema while Guanzon has basically nothing to lose. That is, the current political landscape vis--vis the Guanzon-Cardema rift suggests that Cardemas moves over the past several months may have been a series of gargantuan political miscalculations.

FIRST, Guanzon has little to lose. This is just one of the myriad electoral cases Guanzon handles and she will remain a commissioner no matter how this turns out.


Impeachment is a political exercise so that Cardemas impeachment raps versus Guanzon are unlikely to prosper, as major blocs in both Houses are not exactly fond of Cardema. Moreover, will the Palace be willing to sideline its legislative agenda for the Senate to conduct months worth of impeachment trial? I highly doubt it.

SECOND, Cardema has limited political capital.

Guanzons July tweet may have been construed as alluding to Cardema but Guanzon didnt specifically refer to him, offering her the option to exercise plausible deniability. Cardema, however, took the bait and publicly retaliated with little success.

Guanzon, in just one tweet, managed to expose the limitations of Cardemas political capital.

In a world of rainbows, butterflies, unicorns, and teletubbies, everything boils to down to a question of morality. But reality dictates that most political agreements are quid pro quo, i.e., you scratch my back, I scratch yours. What exactly can Cardema offer that will overwhelm the overwhelming opportunity costs?

THIRD, Cardemas evidence will likely backfire.

Days after he initially accused Guanzon of extortion, Cardema released a series of screenshots that purportedly showed his text conversations with Guanzons alleged bagman in Congress. Cardema redacted the names, phone numbers, and numerous other parts of the exchange, thus raising questions regarding authenticity.

If anything, the screenshots may likely backfire on Cardema because the screenshots are essentially declarations against interest. One of the screenshots show that Cardema agreed to the lobby for the appointments of several people in exchange for a favorable Comelec decision, which sounds like a budding corruption case against Cardema.

Cardemas biggest mistake? Cardema didnt wait, even if a few weeks is all the waiting he had to do. If he just allowed the original first nominee to sit as congressman first then told her to withdraw a day later, the issue wouldve been under the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal instead of Comelec, and he has better chances there.

But he didnt, so here we are.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-duterte-youths-cardema-vs.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#TPonMB: Policy suggestions to prevent the recruitment of Filipino youth into rebel groups,"Several parents of senior high school students testified in a series of Senate hearings that leftist groups believed to fronts for the communist insurgent New Peoples Army (NPA) are recruiting their children. And true enough, some of kids really went to the mountains and have become combatants for the rebel group.

I disagree with Leftist ideologies (I consider myself a Centrist) but I recognize every persons right to have her own political views. Advocacy of leftist ideologies is not by itself illegal, but it should stop when its about to lead our youth, most especially our very impressionable minors, into a life of violence.

Whenever I point out a problem, I always try to propose a solution.

Thus, here are several policy recommendations in relation to the issue:

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 17 August 2019].


FIRST, the state can set additional limitations on minors right to freedom of association.

The state recognizes the reality young Filipinos are not yet fully capable of independently making marriage decisions, so the Family Code (EO 209 s. 1987) requires adults aged 18 to 21 to secure notarized parental consent before they are legally allowed to marry.

The decision to go to the mountains and take up arms against the Government is much more serious than deciding to settle down. Just like what the Family Code with respect to marriage, the state can exercise parens patriae jurisdiction over our youth, to prevent them from making decisions that may destroy their future.

SECOND, schools can dissolve campus organizations that are known to advocate sedition and violence.

Liberality of school administrations vary widely but I believe that we can all agree that advocacy of illegal acts like sedition and rebellion is out of the question. Schools must immediately dissolve campus orgs as soon as they call for, say, the downfall of the government (e.g. Ibagsak!). DepEd and CHED, meanwhile, can take appropriate action against schools that neglect to do so.

THIRD, revoke legal recognition for organizations that encourage illegal acts.

Similar to the suggestion to schools, let us enable the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revoke the corporate registration of organizations that are known to call for the governments downfall. Criticizing the government and its policies is one thing, but to call for its utter destruction is another. While were at it, it may be high time to amend the Party-list Act (RA 7941) to exclude organizations that are known to advocate violence, or known to vocally support and/or tolerate groups that do so.


FOURTH, inclusion of insurgency-related topics in primary and secondary education.

Being a native of rural Bulacan, I was aware of massive NPA presence in Doa Remedios Trinidad town in the early 1990s because elders talk about it all the time. But thats about it. I didnt know that they extorted revolutionary taxes from innocent small businessmen, that they burn farm machinery, etc. Our children should be made aware of these things so they can make better decisions when NPA recruiters approach them later in life.


The government should also use its mass media assets to disseminate such information. Sadly, the Presidents own communications team (PCOO) does nothing significant in this regard. To this day, I have yet to see anything on TV, radio, print, or online that even remotely dissuades kids from joining the NPA. I strongly believe that its more important for PCOO to explain the scourge of violent resistance to Filipinos than to Bosnians.

FIFTH, amend the Human Security Act and the Anti-money Laundering Act (AMLA).

Section 18 of the Human Security Act (RA 9372) can be amended to extend the period of detention without Judicial Warrant of Arrest from just three days to at least a week for terrorism suspects.

Terrorism is best proven by retracing paper trails, and three days is simply too short for it. Imagine a terrorist that was arrested on a Friday night. Banks are closed during the weekends so law enforcement will have only one day (thats a Monday) to do all the work. Thats impossible.


With that said, AMLA should also be amended to include an exception on the predicate crime requirement if the offense is terrorism, albeit with additional safeguards to prevent authorities from using this for politicking. To this end, we can set harsher penalties for authorities who use AMLA-sourced anti-terrorism information for purposes other than countering terrorism.

To this day, I have yet to learn of persons in their late 20s or 30s who somehow had an epiphany of sorts and decided to join the NPA. In my best knowledge, NPAs new recruits are mostly those in their late teens and early twenties, i.e., young adults who are desperate to find meaning in their existence and to find their place in this world.

Lets build a framework that allows these children to learn that there are far better choices than taking up arms and shooting fellow Filipinos, because I know for a fact that there are.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-policy-suggestions-to-prevent.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#TPonMB: Health Sec. Duque, lets respect FDAs independence","Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque recently announced that hell consult with the UP-PGH Dengvaxia Task Force regarding the possible reintroduction of the controversial anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, saying he wants a decision on Dengvaxias fate through a consensus among all sectors because a lot of groups have varying positions about this.

But before we go any further, heres some context.
[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 10 August 2019].

The 2017 Dengvaxia scandal stemmed from the haphazard DOH-led mass vaccination program affecting almost a million school-age children. Despite Sanofis own studies admitting that the drug may have serious adverse effects on recipients who have not had dengue, DOH still mass vaccinated in 2016 and 2017 4th graders in Central Luzon, Metro Manila, and Calabarzon.

The Scandal erupted in November, 2017, when Sanofi through a press release admitted that Dengvaxia worsens dengue symptoms in recipients who have no prior history of dengue, thereby confirming Sanofis earlier statement prior to the mass vaccination program, which Sanofi published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2015.

Hundreds of vaccine recipients have allegedly died so far, with Public Attorneys Office (PAO) autopsy reports show that most of the kids exhibited swelling and bleeding in their internal organs, which eventually led to multi-organ failure. The affected families, with PAOs help, have filed cases against DOH, manufacturer Sanofi, and local distributor Zuellig Pharma.

The cases are still pending in various courts and Sanofi has consistently denied liability over these deaths.
After Sanofi failed to submit mandatory post-marketing surveillance reports, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permanently revoked Dengvaxias Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) in February this year, making it illegal in the country.

Hence, I cannot understand why a health secretary is so actively involving himself over an illegal drug that is not even part of the Philippine National Formulary, the official list of drugs that the DOH is legally allowed to procure.


Criminal liability on the part of DOH, Sanofi, and Zuellig, in relation to the mass vaccination program, is a matter that the courts are already handling and lets allow them to decide on it. The issue at, is the propriety of the reinstatement of Dengvaxias CPR and subsequently, the question of who are the right persons to be involved its reinstatement.

Manufacturer Sanofi by nature wants Dengvaxias CPR reinstated, but its also clear that Congress mandated the FDA and no one else to review such submissions and Sec. Duque isnt in FDA.

As a side note, this writer also finds it odd that Dengvaxia advocate and former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral has been doing media rounds lately without disclosing in any of those interviews that she is a trustee of the Zuellig Family Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Dengvaxia local distributor Zuellig Pharmaceuticals.

Former Philippine College of Physicians president Dr. Tony Leachon is right when he recently asked whether Sanofi has already submitted the post-marketing surveillance reports, as those missing reports are what made the FDA revoke Dengvaxias CPR in the first place.

If it still hasnt submitted these reports, then the debate is over. Otherwise, its up to the FDA and FDA alone to independently review these reports, check for compliance, and decide whether to reinstate Dengvaxias registration or not. With that said, this writer cant help but feel sympathy for the UP-PGH professionals who are now under extreme and unnecessary pressure.

If Sec. Duque insists on dipping his hands into the issue, then he must at least make public Sanofis missing post-surveillance reports that it must have submitted recently. The secretary should let the public see what Sanofi has to say about the hundreds of thousands of kids that, as Senator Richard Gordon put it, were treated like guinea pigs.

Dengvaxias proponents argue that the drug may be sufficiently safe for those who have had dengue, and this writer agrees with them. However, if Dengvaxia must be reinstated, then it must be reinstated with clear guidelines on how it should administered, taking into account data collected over the past three years that it was available in the market, the same data that can be found only in Sanofis post-marketing surveillance reports, the same reports that are still missing, apparently.

Sec. Duque is strongly encouraged to let the FDA do its job without undue external interference. FDA officer-in-charge Usec. Eric Domingo is more than capable of accomplishing that, especially since he hails from Pampanga, one of the provinces covered by the botched 2017 Dengvaxia mass vaccination Program.

Sec. Duque must focus only on tasks that he is legally allowed to do, and that doesnt include FDAs job. Truth be told, Sec. Duques latest moves may even be construed as engaging in acts beyond his authority to perform, opening him up to possible lawsuits from the FDA and even from any citizen who feels that the secretarys actions are endangering public safety.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-health-sec-duque-lets-respect.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#TPonMB: What, exactly, is a legitimate journalist?","As I write my first column piece, I think its best to introduce myself first.

[NOTE: This piece was first published in the Manila Bulletin on 03 August 2019].


My name is Rey Joseph Nieto, best known as the publisher of the Facebook page Thinking Pinoy (TP) with over 1.4 million organic followers. I also a co-host the radio show Karambola, which airs weekdays 8 to 10 am on DWIZ 882 AM. And yes, I am that chubby controversial resource person in the October 2017 Senate hearing on fake news.

I am aware that social media is not the be-all and end-all of public discourse, hence my decision to start writing a column for one of the countrys most esteemed publications. And I am eternally grateful to Manila Bulletins senior editors for giving me this opportunity.

While were at it, I also wish to thank my mentors, the former SunStar Davao editor-in-chief Stella Estremera, Philippine News Agency director Gigie Agtay, and former Manila Standard editor-in-chief Jojo Robles (bless his soul): I would not have gone this far without you.

Now, lets get it on.
For the past three years, weve been witnesses to what appears to be a war for public recognition among media practitioners. On one side are new social media-based political personalities who enjoy massive online followings, and on the other are traditional journalists who benefit from massive distribution networks of their media outlets.

I now find this extremely ironic because I am a social media personality on one hand and with this first column piece, a traditional media man on the other. But just like what my late mentor Jojo Robles always told me, A journalist should never be his own story.


Let me cite a prime example, though I shall conceal her name because what matters here is the script and not the actor.

A few days ago, a traditional journalist publicly complained on social media about the Department of Transportations (DoTr) supposed preferential treatment, as the latter allegedly allowed a handful of media outlets, while preventing others, to cover the bidding on the New Manila International Airport. She also accused the agency of favoring social media personalities over, in her own words, legitimate journalists.

I called DoTr and they told me they dont really invite media in such events because theyre livestreamed anyway, and that media who were present had asked for access days in advance. DoTr said they wouldve granted the complainant access had she done the same, but she didnt. Thus, the issue seems to have stemmed not from inequitable treatment, but from a simple case of a bruised ego.

What I witnessed is a trait prevalent not only among traditional journalists, but also among social media players  the desperate need for validation.

Regardless of medium, legitimate journalists should let their work speak for itself. A legitimate journalist does not demand respect. Instead, he pours his heart, mind, and soul in every piece he writes, then silently wait for his audience to recognize and acknowledge his brilliance. Legitimate journalists dont go around town with a megaphone screaming how legitimate they are.

As Harvey Specter from Suits once said, Work until you no longer have to introduce yourself.

Journalists, I admit, are humans too. But then, those who aspire to make it into the Big League should see to it that their public statements should be like, borrowing the words of Arthur Miller, a nation talking to itself.

And no, I am not Gods Gift to Journalism. I am nowhere near that and I myself am guilty of having committed more than a few glaring mistakes. After observing mass media for several years as a regular citizen, however, I cannot help but feel great frustration over the work of many Filipino journalists today.

Social media personalities entered the limelight because they filled the vacuum that many traditional journalists left behind, a vacuum that was created after years and years of churning out work thats unresponsive to modern societys needs and tastes.

With that said, I strongly encourage traditional media to reclaim its dominance over Public Discourse, but this should be done not by pulling down newcomers, but by producing content that makes the Filipinos realize, by themselves, that what theyre reading is worth every second spent.

I didnt start this column to prolong the war between traditional media and social media. Instead, I started this to remind everyone out there, including myself, that journalism is about helping the Common Tao make the best possible decisions for his future. And that is possible only if we end this squabble and instead channel our energies towards building this nation that we all love.

Instead of making ourselves the story, lets focus on issues that are truly of national significance, in a way that the Common Tao will more readily and more willingly understand.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/09/tponmb-what-exactly-is-legitimate.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Speaker Cayetano's ""Dolphy Situation"": a super typhoon's brewing in the House?","The entire thing started with the bloody speakership race involving Marinduques Lord Allan Velasco, Leytes Martin Romualdez, and Taguigs Alan Peter Cayetano. For two straight months, media bombarded the public ad nauseam with blow-by-blow reports, as if nothing else matters to the Common Tao.

Taguig 1st District Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano emerged victorious, but not without great cost.

How much political capital does he have left, and is it enough for him to survive for 15 months?

In the interest of full disclosure, I was briefly a consultant for the Department of Foreign Affairs from July to October 2017, then under Sec. Alan Peter Cayetano. I initially intended to be a 1-peso consultant but DFA officials said I should receive at least the P12,000 monthly minimum rate, which I decided not to collect after I amicably left the agency.

Despite this, I am convinced that Public Interest requires me to proceed with writing this article.

Besides, no less than President Duterte himself in his July 2019 State of the Nation Address encouraged every Filipino citizen to criticize the government when he said:
You are free to investigate. I don't take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.""
And in line with the president's statement, lets get it on.

Cayetanos precarious hold on power
As far as I can see, Cayetanos current situation is reminiscent of a line from the comedy legend Dolphy.

Asked about his reluctance to enter Politics, Dolphy said:
Doon nga ako natatakot, kasi baka manalo ako (Thats what Im afraid of, because I might win).
The context within which Dolphy said these words is his fear of neglecting his duties as a public official: he really needs to serve the country if he enters into public office, and hed rather not run at all if he cant do that. The offer to run came at a time when it was starting to be fashionable for showbiz celebrities to venture into politics, an offer that Dolphy gracefully declined.

Fair enough.

Cayetanos context, however, is a little different. That is, after winning the Speakership on 22 July 2019, will Cayetano be a House Speaker through and through or just a speaker only in name? And more importantly, for how long?

Unlike the Presidency where the winner becomes the de facto god of the Executive Branch, the Speaker of the House is generally considered as primus inter pares, meaning first among equals. Unlike the president who can be removed only through impeachment, the House Speaker may be removed through a much simpler process of nominal voting within the chamber.

House of Representatives Rule XV Sec.116 extensively defines the process of nominal voting but in a nutshell, the House Speakership may be declared vacant if 154 (thats 50% + 1) of all 306 congressmen vote in favor of such.

For how long will Cayetano be able to prevent 154 from being bold enough to defy him on this level?

That, I believe, is the most interesting question in Batasang Pambansa today.

Scratch that. Regardless of political color, it's the most interesting Philippine political power struggle question right now.

The Cayetano-Velasco Term-sharing Agreement
A term-sharing agreement between Cayetano and Velasco supposedly exists, where Cayetano is Speaker for the first 15 months then Velasco takes over the remaining 21.

In my best recollection, this arrangement is a first for the House. There may be similar setups in the past but none of them were publicized at all, suggesting that this compromise is so necessary that Cayetano had to publicly admit it in an apparent attempt to assuage disgruntled Velasco allies.

Cayetano, while undoubtedly the most popular politician in his native Taguig City, lacks the same degree of support from his peers in the House. In late June, four major House blocs  PDP-Laban, the Party-list Bloc, NPC, and the Northern Luzon Alliance (NLA)  issued a Multi-party Manifesto of Support for Velascos speakership bid.

PDP-Laban executive vice president and Pampanga 3rd District Rep. Aurelio Gonzales said without naming specific congressmen that partymate Velasco at the time enjoyed the backing of at least 60 from PDP-Laban, 45 from the Party-list Bloc, 20 from NLA, 15 from Nacionalista, 12 from the Liberal Party, and 25 Independents.

That is, at least 177 of the 306 House members want Velasco and not Cayetano, and thats over 50% of the House today... at least according to the largest House bloc PDP-Laban.

Meanwhile, Romualdez-leaning representatives led by Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Michael Defensor claimed 167 congressmen from various parties supported Romualdezs bid.

Both numbers are likely bloated, but one thing is crystal clear:
Not a single congressman publicly came forward to claim that Cayetano enjoyed any significant support from any major congressional power bloc.
I scoured news reports from the day after the elections up to ""SONA Day"" on 22 July 19 and I also asked a large number of my contacts from both the Senate and House of Representatives and none suggested that any significant number House members wanted Cayetano to win.

And as we all know, a political bloodbath ensued.

Cayetano vs the Duterte Kids
In late May, Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte said Cayetano came to her with a veiled threat, that if [she] endorses Rep. Velasco for Speaker, [Cayetano] would break up [the pro-Duterte Coalition] and this, he said, will affect the Presidential Elections of 2022.

In June, Davao City representative Paolo Pulong Duterte threw shade at Cayetano as he said in Filipino:
To my fellow lawmakers, I am just a newcomer but I think that what happened today should serve as a guide for our choice for the next House Speaker Lets choose a leader with respect for others, especially women, may they be the spouses of political rivals
Rep. Dutertes statement after Cayetano accused rival Velascos wife as among those who machinated for a term-sharing agreement between the Cayetano and Velasco. Cayetano apparently wanted to be a speaker for a full three years but he was aware that the compromise agreement was necessary, in light of his lack of popular support in the House.

A Utilitarian Truce?
The two younger Dutertes met with the three speakership candidates in early July and successfully came out with what appears to be a truce.

But this is classic politics, as Balkanization within the pro-Duterte Coalition goes against the interests of any of the meetings attendees. The five had to strike a truce out of political necessity, even if its just for show.

Yes, the Duterte kids still seem to dislike Cayetano, a suspicion reinforced when Rep. Paolo Duterte threw not-so-subtle shade at Cayetano during the first session of Congress.

In his speakership nomination speech, Duterte said:
I nominate a leader who understands local and national governance, one who can bridge the different branches of government, one who can ably and fearlessly represent the House of Representatives and the Philippines in the international arena. Mister Speaker, I nominate the distinguished gentleman from the district
A long pause followed as the younger Duterte pretended to double-check the paper hes reading then winked at members on the floor, a cheeky gesture greeted by uncomfortable laughter within the session hall.

Eight-or-so awkward seconds later, he eventually nominated Cayetano, but not without clearly expressing through a brilliantly-timed silence his reluctance to do so.

See it for yourself by watching this video:


But Cayetano still made it, right?
Cayetano appear to have ruffled not only the feathers of the influential Duterte children, but also those of his peers in the house.

In an early July phone interview with ABS-CBN News, Buhay Party-list representative Lito Atienza said:
Thats what Congressman Cayetano has been bandying around, that he is supported by the cabinet and that in fact, the cabinet would react negatively against the president if [Cayetano] doesnt get his term-sharing idea.
This is an extremely loaded statement coming from Atienza, as the phrase the cabinet would react negatively against the president may be construed as the cabinet will do something against the presidents wishes if Cayetano doesnt become the speaker.

Atienza, according to the same report, also said Cayetano threatened the House with problems with the budget if he doesn't get his way.

Here's the video clip of that report:



Its unfortunate that ABS-CBN didnt ask follow up questions to clarify this loaded statement.

With that said, Atienza seems to have accused Cayetano and his alleged cohorts of blackmailing the House, with the term cabinet referring to a group composed of several cabinet members led by Finance Sec. Carlos Sonny Dominguez.

Dominguez has stringently denied Atienzas accusations. He told ABS-CBN that the cabinet consults with the House only in relation to the preparation of the proposed National Budget.

ABS-CBN didnt get Cayetanos side but the solon will obviously deny Atienzas claims, so lets just assume that he did deny them.

Who backed Cayetano?
Whats clear, however, is that Atienza accused Cayetano of threatening the House with the cabinet would react negatively against the president if he doesnt get his way, although its unclear whether the cabinet will actually go against the president or Cayetanos simply bluffing his way through.

Whichever the case, Atienza clearly accused Cayetano of threatening the House with massive governmental disarray.

While Cayetano is known to enjoy the staunch support of a wealthy mining magnate, I doubt that the businessman has enough clout to persuade congressmen to switch to Cayetanos side and I know of no Big Business interests that is backing Cayetanos bid.

Adding the fact that Cayetano enjoys negligible support from House members as explained in the previous section, logic dictates that Cayetanos only significantly powerful backer would be some people in the Duterte Cabinet.
A high-ranking opposition congressman, whose name shall be withheld after citing fear of retaliation, said President Duterte, just like his two politician-children Paolo and Inday Sara, really wanted Velasco. Some of his more influential secretaries, however, managed to override his wishes.

And it appears that the influence of Cayetanos group of backers from outside of Congress, whoever they are, was enough to snag the speakership.
Cayetanos first month in Batasan

House sources independently told this writer that Speaker Cayetano has so far made three major decisions in this first month as House Speaker, namely:
That Congressional consultants will not be given consultancy fees for July 2019,
That contracts of a large number of congressional employees will not be renewed, and,
That there will be a significan reduction of maintenance staff.
At first glance, these sound like relatively innocous administrative decisions but a closer look reveals that these may cause a major migraine for the newly-installed Cayetano.

Let's each of them in greater detail.

First: no consultancy fee payments for July
I spoke with a content writer who handles a veteran Visayas congressmans online assets (website, social media, etc.) for the past several years, for a measly sum of 16,000 monthly via a congressional consultancy contract.

Its already the second week of August so she wondered why her consultancy fees havent been credited to her bank account, and she expressed immense frustration because she has nothing to pay her monthly bills with.


Just yesterday, she found out that the House Leadership decided against paying out consultancy fees for July 2019, a claim that was independently corroborated by another senior House official.

Regardless of the justification behind this alleged move, it is plenty obvious that all House consultants wont be too happy about it.

Congressional consultants strongly influence the decisions of their congressman-principal. As explained in the previous sections, a large number of congressmen are already holding grudges against Cayetanos speakership, grudges that they so far choose to hold at bay. But will these congressmen still be able to hold back if theyre continuously egged on by their consultants, the same consultants that the Cayetano Leadership didnt pay in July?

Thats the 16,000-peso question.

Second: non-renewal of employment contracts
The House Leadership, sources say, will not be renewing the employment contracts of a large number of House employees and the first wave of non-renewals has already commenced.

Many of the affected House employees have continuously served the chamber for years, and the nature of congressmen being elective officials with term limits forces Congressmen to hire them only on a contractual basis, possible only with approval from the Speaker of the House.


2019 election results show there are at least 140 of the 306 congressmen are serving their second or third term, meaning at least 140 need congressmen need to renew their employees contracts.

How many of these 140-or-so solons were affected by this policy and how would those affected react to the reality that non-renewal means will lose their most experienced and most trusted workforce?

And yes, thats a rhetorical question.

Third: reduction of maintenance staff
The House Leadership, sources say, also intend on reducing the maintenance staff of the Batasang Pambansa complex, or those tasked with ensuring clean, orderly safe, and functional House facilities.

I find this odd because there are only 2 or so janitors per floor so HoR Maintenance is already grossly understaffed as it is. Considering that there are over 660 restrooms in the entire Batasang Pambansa Complex, I cannot imagine how a small workforce will be able to handle all the work.

A Southern Luzon congressman told me that corruption is the knee-jerk theory to explain this move, as Speaker Cayetanos opponents may argue that the Taguig congressman may be planning to replace retrenched maintenance staff with people from a friendly manpower agency but the South Luzon congressman said its unlikely.

There arent a lot of janitors to justify such a theory, he said. Instead, he said its not unlikely that the janitors will be replaced by ones loyal to the new House Leadership.

He said I should remember that janitors are like a walking CCTV system: they know who visits which congressman and at times, they get to overhear confidential conversations between powerful people as they, say, mop the floor.

A living, breathing CCTV
The South Luzon congressmans alternate theory makes quite some sense because publicly available evidence indicate that House employees are likely fond of Cayetanos predecessor Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

Arroyo was known to be very generous with employee remuneration. In September last year for example, then Speaker Arroyo gave every House employee a 35,000-peso bonus to get through taghirap months. This is on top of the 5,000-peso grocery allowance they received a month before.


And while Arroyo has never publicly expressed her preference for the new speaker, all her allies backed the candidacy of Martin Romualdez, so pretty much everyone believes she supported the Leyte legislator.

Who will be more fond of if I were a janitor in the House, my former employer with a proven history of generosity, or someone whose track record so far involves allegedly Draconian austerity measures?

Thats a rhetorical question.

The congressman said Arroyos political rivals may see the current maintenance staff as Arroyo and her allies CCTV, and its in her rivals interest to replace them with his own.

Who, again, was Arroyos staunchest critic not too long ago?

That, again, is a rhetorical question.

And how would congressmen who may have been benefitting from these janitorial eyes react to the decision to let these janitors go?

That, again, is a rhetorical question.

Let me summarize what was discussed so far
A vast majority of the members of the House of Representatives wanted either Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco or Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez to become House Speaker and Cayetano never publicly received significant support from any significant Congressional bloc.

Cayetano still managed prevail, allegedly through the backing of some powerful Duterte cabinet members who, in turn, were supposedly able to dissuade the President from publicly backing Velasco.


Cayetano eventually became speaker, albeit through a very reluctant majority vote. Most of the House, including those who reluctantly voted for Cayetano, still hold a grudge against the new speaker up to now, although many of them choose to keep their feelings private for fear of retaliation.

But ill feelings are like a poorly constructed dam that can burst with enough rainfall and some of the rainfall came in the form of heavy-handed policies that directly contradict the core political interests of these disenchanted lawmakers.

Exodus Chapter 1
Just last week, 12 PDP-Laban members moved to the National Unity Party (NUP) after citing internal conflict within the administration party, with Presidential son and Davao City Rep. Paolo Duterte leading the pack.

Thats a Statement with a capital S.

Inday Sara, the other presidential child, is a mayor and not a House member so she obviously cant do the same even if she wanted to.

But had she been one, would she?

Did the three new policies help catalyze the mass exodus? After all, a person with 999,999 pesos in his bank account still needs an extra peso to be called a millionaire: without that seemingly insignificant peso, he cannot be part of the club.

Note that NUP is still largely supportive of the administration, but its composition strongly suggests that it is not as heavily influenced by Malacaang as the administration PDP-Laban.

That is, the younger Duterte and the PDP Laban solons choice to join NUP may be reasonably interpreted as ""Hey Mr. President, we still support you but we don't like this speaker.""

Will these three new policies, and possible other policies that I have yet to be aware of, catalyze even more defections? Only time will tell.

But more importantly, will members of the House of Representatives be fine with the introduction of even more of the same policies, or will they stop the bleeding while they can?

The next several weeks will be very interesting, my little birds said.

I agree with the Southern Luzon solon: its fun to have walking and breathing CCTVs, really.

Dolphy's line perfectly sums up Cayetano's current situation.
Doon nga ako natatakot, kasi baka manalo ako (Thats what Im afraid of, because I might win).
Yes, Cayetano won the speakership, but given the circumstances under which he won, along with his alleged deeds so far, what being a ""Speaker Cayetano"" really mean?

I'm curious on whether the widespread social media ops will escalate further after this",RJ Nieto,"August 15, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/08/speake-alan-peter-cayetano-paolo-duterte.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"ex-DFA Sec. del Rosario, China, the Fishermen, the Incident and Reed Bank's Oil","If I were in Albert del Rosario's shoes...


Its public knowledge that President Duterte himself admitted that itll be difficult to exploit oil and gas resources in the South China Sea because of ongoing territorial disputes, especially one between China and the Philippines. This is the same reason why Philex Petroleum a.k.a. PXP Energy, which holds exploration and drilling rights over Reed Bank (SC 72), repeatedly failed in its moves to establish operations in the area.

PXP Energys 2018 Audited Financial Statement said Sampaguita gas field in Reed Bank is estimated to contain 2.6 trillion cu. ft. in discovered reserves and up to 5.4 trillion cu. ft. of undiscovered reserves.

The January 2019 US Natural Gas industrial price is USD 5.04 dollars per thousand cu. ft.. Using this figure, the Sampaguita Gas Field contains around US$13.1 billion in discovered reserves and around US$ 27.2 billion in undiscovered reserves. Thats about Php 674 billion and Php 1.4 trillion, respectively (PHP:USD = 51.44:1).

PH-CHINA OIL EXPLORATION MOU: A WAY FORWARD
On 21 November 2018, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping in a historic move signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on joint exploration in the South China Sea, providing both parties a diplomatic way to move forward with mutually taking economic advantage of South China Seas idle petroleum resources.

Through the MoU, each party will form a Working Group that will negotiate and agree on technical and commercial arrangements that will apply in the relevant working area.

That is, each side will have teams that will set terms regarding who does what in the drilling and exploration process, who gets how much of the profits, and whom the end-products will be sold to.


China authorized its state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) as the Chinese enterprise for each China-side working group, while the Philippines will authorize firms with active services contracts for a given area or, if theres none, the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company.

MoUs are essentially just agreements to agree, i.e. it is a very preliminary phase of any prospective oil and gas project in the South China Sea. However, the MoU states that China and the Philippines will strive to finalize cooperation agreements within 12 months of the MoU, i.e. by November 2019.

PXP ENERGY AND DENNIS UY
On 04 December 2018 and given the MoU, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi told PXP Energy that it can start applying for the lifting of the ban on oil and gas exploration in Reed Bank, which DOE declared in 2014 amidst escalating tensions in the South China Sea.

On 21 December 2018, PXP Energy announced that it has formally requested the Energy Department to lift the said ban.


On 27 December 2018, PXP Energy and Dennis Uys Dennison Holdings Corporation disclosed that they will be sealing an oil and gas exploration deal over Reed Bank by March 2019. A separate news report said this is subject to CNOOCs approval and consent, presumably in accordance with the November 2018 PH-China MoU.

The MoU really is very welcome news for PXP Energy, known to perennially post losses and whose continued existence, judging from its financial reports, lies heavily on the hope that it can finally tap Reed Bank.

Additionally, PXP Energys prospective partnership with Dennis Uy provides the financially struggling company with much-needed liquidity plus a possibly more favorable relationship with Malacanang given Dennis Uys perceived closeness to the President and his men.

For PXP Energy, so far, so good.


HOPE DIMS FOR PXP ENERGY
Is China willing to work with PXP Energy and Dennison in Reed Bank? Lets see.

On 11 January 2019, Dennis Uys Phoenix Petroleum disclosed that DOE greenlighted its partnership with CNOOC to build a US$ 2 billion Liquefied Natural Gas import terminal in Batangas.

On 01 February 2019, Phoenixs Board seconded DOEs approval as it gave go-signal for the Phoenix-CNOOC Tanglawan joint venture.

China appears to be very much willing to work with Phoenix and by extension, Dennis Uy. Given that Uy is prospectively partnering with PXP over Reed Bank, its so far so good for PXP, until


On 28 February 2019, PXP chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan said PXP reached out to the Chinese CNOOC but its radio silence on their part.

China, while willing to work with Uy, is apparently unwilling to work with Pangilinan. It seems that Dutertes good relations with Beijing isnt enough to make China forget its experience with Pangilinan in 2012, when Beijing rejected Pangilinans 2012 oil and gas exploration proposal directed to CNOOC.

On 01 March 2019, Phoenix, CNOOC, and PNOC signed MoU for the Tanglawan LNG Plant.

On the same day, President Duterte threated to shut down Pangilinans PLDT for busy anti-graft hotline 8888. He also accused PLDT of owing the government Php 8 billion, along with a subtle threat when he said no President has ever asked for payment, an accusation that Pangilinan denied.

China seems to still dislike PXP Energy and to makes matters worse, Duterte seems to feel the same about its owner.

DENNIS UY DITCHES PXP ENERGY
Just when I thought PXP Energys relationship with China cant get any worse

On 13 March 2019, former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario accused China President Xi Jinping of Crimes Against Humanity at the International Criminal Court.

Del Rosario is a director of Hong Kong-based First Pacific, PXP Energy's parent company.


I cant imagine how China will take Del Rosarios brash moves lightly, and true enough, it was all downhill from there.

On 29 March 2019, PXP Energy disclosed that is has terminated its deal with Dennison Holdings, i.e. Dennis Uy is now out of the Reed Bank exploration project.

Dennison effectively jettisoned PXP energy from its future plans: is this merely a coincidence or a result of how China and Duterte view Pangilinan?

On 01 April 2019, PXP Energy share prices nose-dived by nearly 19%. This is the business day immediately succeeding the 29 March 2019 announcement of the PXP-Dennison split.


On 10 April 2019, PXP Energy disclosed its latest list of Top 100 Stockholders, which includes former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario.

On 15 April 2019, PXPs stocks plunged to Php 6.84 a share, down 44% from 29 March 2019s Php 12.28 [https://bloom.bg/2Lb1nLx].


Things are looking really bad for del Rosario's PXP energy.

IF CHINA LIKES DENNIS UY
Beijing apparently sees PXP Energy and Dennis Uy on the opposite sides of the Likeability Spectrum.

On 16 April 2019, Phoenix and PNOC execs visited CNOOCs LNG plant in China, which shall be used as a pattern for the Tanglawan LNG plant.

Phoenix Petroleum's Dennis Uy, CNOOC's Wu Zhengxing, and PNOC's Reuben Lista sign a Memorandum of Understanding for the Tanglawan LNG project.

As Pangilinan and PXP struggle, Uy appears to blossom.

On 08 May 2019, PXP Energy disclosed that it will take guidance from the Philippine Government in as far as its Reed Bank interests, and said it hopes that DoE lifts the ban on exploration soon.


Nothing new here, although PXPs stock prices relatively stabilized after the announcement.

On 27 May 2019, Dennis Uy said PXP Energy and his Dennison Holdings agreed to ditch their deal because of uncertainty of government-to-government transactions. PXP Energy in a PSE disclosure welcomed Uys statement and said PXP energy is at the moment focused on lifting the DoE ban on SC 72 and 75 to allow exploration activities to resume.

I think this is very telling.

Judging from these, it appears that  China is open to jointly explore and exploit with the Philippines the South China Sea for oil, but that she doesn't wanna do it with PXP Energy. 

We know that China like Dennis Uy and China dislikes PXP Energy. If theres uncertainty in government-to-government transactions, and the only major variables are China, PXP, and Uy, then which major variable is the likely cause of uncertainty?

The Cause of Uncertainty
Note that I have been using the phrase dislikes PXP Energy instead of dislikes Pangilinan. It is still unclear to me if China has beef with Pangilinan per se or with First Pacific in general, and I am inclined to believe its the latter given Del Rosarios overtures.

But to solely blame the uncertainty to PXP is unfair, especially since no less than Foreign Secretary Teddy Boy Locsin insisted drafting the joint exploration agreement. This is the same Locsin that, a highly placed government source says, is an Amboy who spends more time in New York than in the DFA headquarters on Roxas Boulevard.

The same source, whose identity will remain concealed for his safety, told this writer:
President Xi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent signals that we are moving towards joint exploration because it doesnt make sense to place everything on hold. Our own DoE has been saying that we need alternatives to Malampaya (Gas Facility), but remember that Sec. Locsin demanded that hell be the author of any joint exploration agreement.
Locsin has not been sufficiently subtle in his general dislike for China when he unilaterally revamped President Dutertes independent foreign policy from Friend to All, Enemy to None to the more angsty (and less eloquent) Friend to Friends, Enemy to Enemies, and Worse Enemies to False Friends., in an apparent swipe at China.

This is despite Malacaang repeated assertions that Dutertes pre-Locsin foreign policy stays.


Suffice it to say, aside from Chinas apparent dislike for PXP, the American-leaning Locsin seems to also be in the way.

THE JUNE 2019 REED BANK INCIDENT
The developments up to the end of May 2019 seem to imply that Reed Bank exploration is a no go for the foreseeable future as far as PXP Energy stockholder and First Pacific director Albert del Rosario is concerned.

Then suddenly

On 12 June 2019, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced a collision of two shipping vessels  one Chinese and another Filipino  in Reed Bank.

Then a day later

On 13 June 2019, Del Rosario in response to Lorenzana said the Philippines must now consider a multilateral approach on the South China Sea Issue, citing that China has absolutely no respect for the Rule of Law.

The Philippines under Duterte adopted a bilateral approach over the SCS dispute, i.e. Manila dialogues directly with Beijing with no other state actors involved.

The multilateral approach that del Rosario insists on means the inclusion of other states in talks, other states like those within the ASEAN and most likely, the United States.

It is common knowledge in government circles that Del Rosario leans heavily towards the United States

The US-educated Del Rosario is very intimately linked with the pro-Washington US-Philippine Society where PXPs Pangilinan also sits as co-chairman and where top US diplomat and George W. Bush-era State Secretary John Negroponte serves as president.

SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT DEL ROSARIOS LATEST
Del Rosario immediately blamed Beijing for the collision despite the fact that investigations have yet to commence, which is the total opposite what happened just a few years prior, when he was still DFA Secretary.

Del Rosarios reaction is in stark contrast with a similar incident in 2014, or when a Hong Kong-registered commercial ship collided with a Philippine fishing boat, killing a Filipino fisherman and leaving four others missing.

CULPRIT? The Hong Kong-registered, 195-meter MV Peach Mountain is suspected to have rammed a Philippine fishing boat on June 20 off the waters of Bolinao in Pangasinan. Survivors say their fishing boat is similar in size to the 13-meter vessel shown above. (via Inquirer)
Commenting on the incident, then President Benigno Aquino, whose Foreign Secretary at the time was del Rosario, said the government wasnt accusing any country of involvement until all evidence is in.

Does del Rosario have something to do with the incident?

I cannot help but wonder as succeeding events revealed major plot holes in the anti-China narratives of the political opposition, where del Rosario belongs.

FIRST, the 12 June 2019 Lorenzana statement was immediately followed by a media blitz that is still running as of this articles writing, with the general tone that share pretty much the same wavelength as Del Rosarios 13 June 2019 statements.

SECOND, the media blitz shortly later included anti-China statements from the Filipino fishing vessels captain, despite the ships cook later admitting that the captain was asleep when the incident happened.

THIRD, up to this day, none of the 22 affected fishermen have executed sworn affidavits and continued to grant media interviews. Apparently, none of del Rosarios allies, many of whom are lawyers, explained to the fishermen that the longer they wait to execute an affidavit, the easier it is to impeach their testimonies in court.

The list of inconsistencies in the Anti-china version of events goes on and on, suggesting that the prematurely anti-Beijing rhetoric, at the least, is staged.

DEL ROSARIO WITH HELP FROM LOCSIN
And apparently, with a bit of help from Locsin, whether Locsin is aware of it or not.

On 15 June 2019, the Chinese Embassy in Manila, in response to the incident, promised to handle this issue with the Philippines in a serious and responsible manner.

On 18 June 2019, the Chinese Foreign Ministry in a very mildly worded statement extended its sympathy to the Filipino fishermen and followed up with an offer to jointly investigate the incident with its Philippine counterparts, an offer that Malacaang seriously considered.

China's calm and reconciliatory tone in both statements is a total departure from the harsh rhetoric it used during the Aquino Era, suggesting, at least at first glance, that China was also surprised by the June incident.

Shortly after Malacaang showed some inclination towards a joint China-Philippine investigation, Foreign Secretary Locsin categorically rejected Chinas offer.

On 18 June 2019, Locsin tweeted, There cannot be a joint investigation. First principle of justice: no one can be judge of his own case....

Locsins grandstanding is odd, if not utterly stupid.

Malacaang, or where Locsin takes orders from, already said its inclined to accept the Chinese offer of a joint investigation, and last time I checked, Locsin is NOT the President.

Moreover, the clause no one can be judge of his own case (Latin: Nemo judex in causa sua), is a legal principle which states that no person can judge a case in which he has an interest in.

While China indeed has an interest in the Reed Bank Incident, the Philippines does too. That principle applies to both China and Philippines so Locsin, wittingly or (more likely) unwittingly, suggested a third party should the investigate, which would turn a bilateral issue into a multilateral one.

Sounds familiar? Yes, because del Rosario used the same term a day after Lorenzanas announcement.

Malacaang immediate corrected Locsin a day later when

On 22 June 2019, Malacaang said it welcomes and accepts the offer of the Chinese Government to conduct a joint investigation

But seriously, what can we expect from a Foreign Secretary who conducts Foreign Policy over Twitter?

ANOTHER DEL ROSARIO PR STUNT
While Locsin was busy defying Duterte

On 21 June 2019, del Rosario engaged in yet another PR stunt when he attempted to enter Hong Kong and told the immigration counter that his purpose for visit is to attend a First Pacific board meeting.

Yes, he told China in China that he will be reporting to First Pacific in China, the same First Pacific that controls PXP Energy that China seems to deeply detest.

Del Rosario even (mis)used his courtesy diplomatic passport, suggesting that his HK tte--tte is official business of the Philippine Government. He was denied entry, of course.

A day later, DFA said its cancelling all courtesy diplomatic passports issued to former Foreign Secretaries and retired ambassadors, halting del Rosarios PR barrage.
Del Rosario on a final attempt at a Dick Cheney?

As Leiden University-educated International Relations scholar and Maastricht University lecturer Sass Sasot pointed out, it appears that former Foreign Sec. Albert del Rosario has been doing to the South China Sea what US VP Dick Cheney did to Iraq in 2003.

Former Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney resigned from the oil giant shortly before he became the Vice-president of the United States. While keeping his business interests in Halliburton, he fiercely advocated for the US invasion of Iraq, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians and armed personnel. Halliburton, as soon as the war ended, emerged the winner as it snagged billions of dollars worth of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, with the first US$489 million  for its subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root.

Del Rosario, meanwhile, resigned from First Pacific and because the Foreign Secretary. While keeping his interests in First Pacific subsidiary PXP Energy, del Rosario crafted the Aquino-era Philippine Foreign Policy, which heavily relies on the existence of the 1951 US-PH Mutually Defense Treaty

The only significant difference from that Cheney and this one is that Cheney has already succeeded in promoting a war, while del Rosario is apparently still trying his best: del Rosario seems to be desperately trying to start a war that will benefit his own business interests

After Statement on Bikoy: Caloocan Bishop David either a hypocrite or a liar?,"Caloocan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David's statement denying complicity in the now-discredited Bikoy Videos show glaring inconsistencies, suggesting that the bishop is either a hypocrite or a liar... or is he something else?

Let's discuss.


In a statement dated 06 June 2019, Caloocan Bishop Fr. Virgilio David admitted that he met Peter Joemel ""Bikoy"" Advincula in early February of this year. David said Davao's Jesuit Fr. Albert Alejo, accompanied by Advincula, met with him briefly.

David wrote:
I expected only him but he came accompanied by a man whom he did not even properly introduce to me. Since I could spare less than an hour and was rushing to another appointment at 9am, I met them only for a little while, over coffee.""
David added:
""Perhaps conscious of the time constraint, Fr. Alejo told me very briefly that the mans life was in danger, that he was being pursued by a drug syndicate he used to work with, and that he needed sanctuary. He was a chubby bespectacled young man; he struck me also as a glib-talker.""
Glib means fluent but insincere.

David went on to explain that situations like those ""are not new"" to him, and that he the term ""drug syndicate"" raised a red flag. He then said he advised Alejo to ""seek help from people who might be in a better position"" to deal with Advincula's situation.

He said ""it was not until months later"" that David recognized the man in the videos as the Advincula that he met in February and went on to say:
""Perhaps if I had not been in such a rush, I would have followed my instincts and navely provided sanctuary to a SNAKE!""

A few things off about Bishop Davids statement
David said he felt insincerity on Advinculas part so he didnt take Alejos request seriously. But then, David also said the meeting was very brief, so is David saying that he can judge a persons character in just a span of, say, a few minutes?

I doubt that a self-professed Man of God would judge people that quickly.

Moreover, Fr. Alejo is a very high-profile priest. Hes the same guy who helped Edgar Matobato and Arturo Lascaas, the witnesses presented during the Senate Hearings on the War against Drugs. David knows about Alejo, yet he dismissed Alejos request just like that?


Just how many times has Alejo approached David for help with a whistleblower?

There are two possibilities:  rarely and  a lot.

 Suppose Alejo rarely approaches David
Given Alejos very high profile and the rarity of Alejos requests, David could not simply dismiss Alejos actions as insignificant. Even if David considers Advincula as insincere, he must have at least inquired through Alejo or other sources about whats going on. Surely, somebody of Davids education, experience, and stature must know how to deftly deal with such situations, especially if it could backfire on him, just like whats happening right now.
 Suppose Alejo approaches David a lot
If Alejo made approaching David a habit every time Alejo finds an alleged whistleblower, then David must already have a pretty good idea about Alejos ability in vetting people. David is a staunch critic of President Dutertes War on Drugs, so he must be familiar with Lascaas and Matobato, both of whom are generally believed to have enjoyed Alejos protection. 
Assuming that David believes finds Lascaas and Matobato credible (he never spoke against either), then what is the likelihood that David also found Advincula credible when Alejo introduced the latter? 
Now, even if David found Advinculas story incredulous when they met in February, did Alejos credibility in Davids eyes account for nothing? Even if Advincula seemed insincere, why did David simply dismiss Advinculas claims despite Alejos backing 
Surely, David must have at least exerted some effort in investigating the Alejo-Advincula situation, yet he himself said he didn't.
Both possibilities yield blatant contradictions, suggesting that David is lying.

Now, heres the more interesting part
David himself said he found Advinculas story incredulous, yet he did not speak about it when the Bikoy videos came out.

David in the same statement even wrote, It was not until months later, when the man who had appeared as the hooded Bikoy on videos in the social media, removed his hoodie and identified himself as Peter Joemel Advincula, that I recognized the chubby bespectacled glib-talking young man I had briefly met on February 9, 2019.

The first part of the Ang Totoong Narco List videos series came out during the first week of April 2019. David, given his tenacious opposition to Dutertes Drug War, must have found about it on that same week.

Despite this, I never heard David speak about the video, despite his incessant tirades against the administration on the days that followed.

Let me illustrate:
05 April 2019: Ang Totoong Narco List Episodes 1 and 2 have been been published.
17 April 2019: In an apparent swipe against the government, David encouraged Catholics to renounce evil in the May 2019 elections 
19 April 2019: David attacked the administrations senatorial slate as he asked Catholics if theyd vote for Jesus or Barabbas 
23 April 2019: David admonishes Catholics for allegedly blindly believing that Dutertes Drug War is for Law and Order. 
23 April 2019: In a forum, David decried the supposed age of disinformation, a rebuke of the dominance pro-administration personalities in social media.
24 May 2019: Advincula flip-flops and implicates the political opposition instead.
I attempted to search for any online content dated 06 April 2019 (the day after the first two Bikoy videos were released) to 13 May 2019 (election day, or when Bikoys story was falling apart), online content where David directly referenced to the videos.

I also searched for any drug war-related statements from the Bishop after Advincula flip-flopped (24 May 2019) and BEFORE Advincula implicated him (01 June 2019), and I found none.
I found none.

Bishop knew Advincula was lying, he saw Advincula spread his lies for week, yet he said nothing about it, despite the bishop's uncanny interest in supposedly revealing the truth about President Duterte's Drug war.

Did David, through his recent statement, admit to being a hypocrite?

Bishop Pablo Virgilio David: a hypocrite or a liar?
Suffice it to say, despite Bishops David knowledge that Advincula was blatantly lying, he never bothered to call out the lies that he knew were spreading quickly.

With these said, it appears that the bishop didnt mind the use of lies  of disinformation  to achieve a purpose. He didnt mind that people used the same disinformation that he was whining about during the April forum where he was a speaker.

Despite his supposed advocacy for truthfulness, Bishop David allowed Advinculas lies to spread like wildfire despite his full knowledge that he is in a prime position to stop it or what if we just save some time analyzing his statement by saying that his denying his complicity in the Bikoy Videos is a lie in itself?

Given these, either Bishop David is a hypocrite or hes just another barefaced liar like Advincula.

Bishop David, which of these two do you prefer? But if you prefer something else, please do let me know, because I really want to know.",RJ Nieto,"June 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/06/caloocan-bishop-bikoy-hypocrite-liar.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"On Bulacan Int'l Aiport, Duterte Finance Secretary's personal interests against Common Good?","Massive congestion in NAIA during the August 2018 Xiamen Air Incident, where a plane skidded off the runway, causing the cancellations of numerous flights as NAIA effectively lone runway is blocked.
Instead of allowing a new world-class airport, why does Finance Sec. Sonny Dominguez insist on us using an ultra congested airport and another one that's a bajillion miles away? Are Sonny's personal interests getting in the way of his decision-making? Is Dominguez, like the terminated ICT Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, another poster boy for regulatory capture?

Let's talk about that in greater detail.

NAIA, the worst airport on Earth
You may not know that that Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL/NAIA) is the 32nd busiest airport on the planet, but you probably arent surprised. The airport handled over 45 million passengers in 2018, a six percent increase from the previous year.

This is a far cry from the United States Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta and Chinas Beijing Capital International Airport, each of which handled over 100 million passengers in the same period. However, the fact is that NAIA is already handling 10 million more than its designed capacity of just 35 million passengers annually.

Most airports in the world have two runways each, enabling them to handle two simultaneous landings or takeoffs. NAIA has two runways too. However, NAIA can handle only one landing or takeoff at any given time because the two runways run perpendicular to each other, making simultaneous landings or takeoffs too dangerous.
A Third Runway

Addressing this issue requires building a third runway.

There was a plan to build a third runway during the Aquino Administration but it was shelved in 2015 after it was found out that it requires building over part of Paranaques Merville Subdivision and the closing off of Moonwalk Access Road.

That is, building the third runway requires  evicting hundreds of residents that would pretty much take forever, and  removing a crucial artery of C-5 road that will certainly worsen the already apocalyptic traffic situation in the Metro.

Building a third NAIA runway requires bulldozing a sizeable chunk of the heavily populated Merville Subdivision and building over a major feeder road to C5.
In short, its basically infeasible to increase the number of flights that NAIA can handle. Regardless of how many terminals we build, the fact remains that the number of aircraft that land and take off from NAIA will remain pretty much the same, unless theres a way to more efficiently use the existing runways.

The NAIA Consortium
The Department of Transportation on 02 May 2019 approved the Ayala-led NAIA Consortiums offer to upgrade NAIA. The consortium promised to increase capacity to 65 million passengers yearly as it promises to expand NAIAs terminal complexes and increase hourly takeoff and landing movements up to 52 from the current 40, among others.

While laudable, this airport upgrade is just a band-aid solution.

These are the yearly growth rates of NAIAs passenger traffic according to Airport Council International:

NAIA exceeded its 35 million capacity in mid-2015.
As can be seen above, NAIA, currently designed to handle only 35 million passengers annually, has already been overcrowded since mid-2015.

Today, NAIA handles over 28% more passengers than it should.

With the modest assumption that NAIAs ridership will uniformly increase by 5% annually from hereon out, we can expect over 65 million passengers per year 7 years after 2018. That is, the band-aid solution that is the NAIA upgrade will be good enough only up to 2025.

Now, heres the tragically funny part.

NAIA Upgrade Timeline
The NAIA Upgrade will be done in two phases:
Phase One: improvements and expanding the terminals at the existing NAIA land area. This will increase capacity to 47 million passengers annually and will take two  years to build. 
Phase Two: construction of additional runway, taxiways, passenger terminals and associated support infrastructure. This will increase capacity to 65 million passengers annually and will take ten  years to build.
I honestly dont know how the Ayala-led consortium will manage to find land for the extra runway, but lets assume for now that theyll somehow succeed expropriating land in Merville Subdivision within the intended timeframe.

Now, the NAIA Consortium hopes to start the Swiss Challenge by mid-2019, which is basically a prettier to way to say the bidding process is still ongoing.
Assuming that the bidding process is magically completed by end of 2019 and construction starts immediately thereafter, it takes another twelve years to finish the the entire project.

That is, the entire NAIA Upgrade will end in 2031 at the earliest. That is passenger demand will exceed the 65 million target capacity midway through construction and by the time its completed in 2031 (at the earliest), NAIA would need to cater to around 85 million passengers.


That is, by the time upgrades are completed, NAIA will be handling 20 million passengers more than the new 65 million limit. Thats 31% over capacity.

The NAIA upgrade simply can't keep pace with demand. Yes, NAIA should be upgraded, but we also need a new airport to accommodate rising demand.
Yes, there may be times of economic recession in the future but I think I'd rather not entertain that thought for purposes of passenger traffic projections.

In short, the NAIA Upgrade is basically like using a flimsy band-aid to cover a stab wound.

Mathematics necessitates a second airport
No matter how we put it, the NAIA upgrade will not be enough to meet passenger demand as the overcapacity rate by the end of construction will be even worse than before (28% in 2018 vs 31% in 2031).

The math shown in the previous sections show that with the NAIA Upgrade and without a second airport, regular Filipinos can look forward to longer flight delays, more flight cancellations, higher ticket prices and worst, the revival of inter-island shipping a la SuperFerry.


Therell be too many passengers for such a relatively small airport, ergo not every Juan can fly. Imagine queuing up for a bus ride to the province on a Holy Wednesday, except that youll have to do it in an airport and not just only on Holy Wednesdays, but pretty much EVERY DAMN DAY OF THE YEAR.

Clark (CRK) is also an international airport but its simply too far away from Manila.

Fortunately, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) has a proposal for a Bulacan International Airport a.k.a. New Manila International Airport (NMIA). Bulacan shares borders with Metro Manila and the proposed site is less than an hour away from Valenzuela, Metro Manilas northernmost city.

The airport will also be built in phases but if construction starts this year, SMC said it can have an airport that can handle 35 million passengers up and running in just 3-4 years.

Thats an additional major international airport by 2024, seven years before the NAIA Consortium finishes its upgrade plan.

This is not to say that NAIA will close down. As a matter of fact, most major cities have at least two airports servicing them, such as:
New York: Newark (EWR), La Guardia (LGA), and John F. Kennedy (JFK)
Tokyo: Haneda (HND) and Narita (NRT)
Bangkok: Don Mueang (DMK) and Suvarnabhumi (BKK)
Jakarta: Halim Perdanakusuma (HLP) and Soekarno-Hatta (CGK)
Taipei: Songshan (TSA) and Taoyuan (TPE)
Kuala Lumpur: KL International (KUL) and Sultan Abdul Aziz (SZB)
London: Heathrow (LHR), Gatwick (LGW) and four  others
Metro Manila and surrounding provinces offer more than enough current and future traffic to justify two airports.

Unfortunately, it appears that the NMIA proposal is under threat as some government officials seem to oppose it.

Sonny Dominguez vs Bulacan Airport (NMIA)
The Transportation Department started reviewing the SMC-financed Php 700-billion NMIA proposal in February 2017 and it granted SMC original proponent status in October of the same year. Had the procurement process proceeded as expected, a new airport should have started construction in mid- to late-2018.

Unfortunately, Finance Secretary Carlos Sonny Dominguez appears to have been hindering this effort.

Finance Secretary Carlos Sonny Dominguez
In an August 2018 interview, Socioeconomic Planning Sec. Ernesto Pernia said Whether [NMIA] will be approved within the year or early next year, the only one who can answer that in terms of certainty is the Department of Finance.

A month later, Dominguez questioned the Bulacan Airport proposal.


Dominguez denied causing NMIAs delay, but his actions suggest otherwise.

In particular, he raised the following issues:

NMIA may depress real estate values in New Clark City.
NMIA may cause traffic congestion in North Luzon Expressway (NLEX)
NMIA may require realignment of Manila-Clark Railway
NMIAs proponent may have questionable financial capabilities

Dominguez is being really weird
FIRST, the government is NOT a real estate company, so I do not understand why Dominguez is worried about real estate values in Clark.

SECOND, the solution to potential traffic congestion in NLEX is road widening, not blocking NMIA which, as was shown in earlier sections, is a critical transportation infrastructure.

THIRD, I dont know why railway realignment is an issue for Dominguez because NMIA can simply connect its airport rail link to the nearest railway station, which is whats done in many major airports worldwide, such as:

New York JFK: JFK Airtrain connects to NYC Subway via Howard Beach and Jamaica Stations (see below)
Singapore Changi: A spur line connects to SMRTs Tanah Merah Station (see below)

Bangkok Suvarnabhumi: Bangkok Airport Rail link, a short 6-station line, connects to Phayathai MRT Station in downtown Bangkok. (see below)



In fact, SMC even plans to create a 200-kilometer elevated rail system that will connect the NMIA to EDSA, Metro Manilas main traffic artery, enabling travelers from EDSA to arrive at the airport in just 20 minutes.

Kinda like the Hong Kong Airport Express, but elevated and much longer.

FOURTH, SMC is third largest conglomerate in the Philippines according to the 2018 Forbes 2000 list, next only to SM Investments and BDO Unibank. Moreover, SMC will be in partnership with Incheon International Airport in developing and maintaining NMIA.

Assuming Dominguez is still doubtful of SMCs financial solvency, then why doesnt he allow the Swiss Challenge to proceed and see if the challenger has better financial capacity for a similar undertaking?


SMC has been given original proponent status in late 2017 so the Swiss Challenge shouldve been over by 2018 but it still isnt because, well, DOMINGUEZ.

Why does Dominguez seem so hell-bent at preventing NMIA?

Dominguez: The New Salalima?
I remember those times in early 2017 when I heavily criticized then Information and Communications Technology Secretary Rodolfo Salalima, the chief legal counsel and senior adviser of Globe Telecom until his cabinet appointment on 30 June 2016, for being the poster boy for regulatory capture.

Former DICT Sec. Salalima, whom Duterte asked to resign
Regulatory capture, or where the regulated becomes the regulator, is a form of government failure which occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.

In Salalimas case, what we saw was a telecoms regulator whose entire career prior to his appointment suggests deep loyalty to telecoms firm Globe.


President Duterte eventually fired him in late 2017 because, in the Presidents own words, many complained to me that he appeared to be partial because he's a former vice president of Globe.

Dominguez situation may not be very different from Salalimas.

Dominguez and the Zobel de Ayalas
Early in his career, Dominguez joined the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) until he became the President of BPI Agricultural Development Bank, known today as BPI Direct Savings Bank after a name change in 1990.

Finance Sec. Sonny Dominguez
BPI and its subsidiaries are majority-owned and -controlled by Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, who currently sits as Chairman of the Board.

Dominguez left BPI and Zobel de Ayala when former President Corazon Aquino made him Enviroment Secretary in 1986, but the two still share strong a business relationship up until Dominguez 2016 appointment as PRRDs Finance Secretary.


Dominguez family owns conglomerate Alcantara Group of Davao City. The Alcantara Group, in turn, owns Alsons Consolidated where Dominguez was a director, leaving just days before he took over the Department of Finance in 2016.

Alsons has an existing multi-billion peso joint venture (JV) real estate project with Jaime Augustos Ayala Land called Aviana Development Corp. Incorporated in 2013, Aviana is developing an approximately 27-hectare waterfront property in Lanang, Davao City.

An artist's depiction of Davao City's Azuela Cove, a joint venture between Dominguez's family corporation and Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala's Ayala Land. It is still under construction.
In short, Dominguezs family has a multi-billion-peso business relationship with Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala.

Why is this relevant?
The NAIA Consortium is Ayala Corporations brainchild, the same Ayala who ""coincidentally"" happens to be the premier business partner of Dominguez Family and a sister company of the bank where Dominguez spent his young professional life.

New Manila International Airport in Bulacan, on the other hand, is by San Miguel Corporation and a Korean Company: Ayala has no stake in the project.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Since 2014, NMIA developer San Miguel Corporations largest shareholder is Iigo Zobel, relative of Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala. These two Ayalas, says sources and to put it lightly, are not the same. Iigo inherited his fortune from father Enrique Zobel who in 1983 was estranged from the Zobel de Ayalas main branch where Jaime Augusto belongs. That is, Iigos businesses are separate and oftentimes in competition with Jaime Augustos Ayala Corp.
Now, some may see NMIA as a threat to the profitability of the Php 350-billion NAIA upgrade project, especially since NMIA, upon total completion, will be able to handle 100 million passengers yearly, potentially turning it into the country's premier aviation hub and NAIA into a secondary airport.

But from the point of view of an average Filipino, I do not care which is which, as long as we have aviation infrastructure than can meet the public demand, and that is what we can't have if we won't build a new airport.

What we have here is a Finance Secretary who has the final say on the NMIA proposal, despite his strong personal links to NMIAs competitor. Instead of inhibiting from the issue out of delicadeza, Dominguez further complicated matters as he openly spoke against NMIA despite his familys business interests with the Ayala Corporation.

And by the way, Dominguez efforts toward protecting real estate values in New Clark City may benefit not only the new metropolis, but also the suburbs surrounding it.

Ayala Land also has multiple suburban housing projects that can cater to prospective workes of New Clark City.
And guess what? Ayala Landss Avida Northdale, Montala Alviera, Marquee Residences, BellaVita, and Avida Settings Alviera, are all situated in New Clarks surrounding cities and municipalities.

Are Dominguezs clashing interests a mere coincidence or a case of regulatory capture?

By the way, the Dominguez-led Department of Finance recent attacks against NMIA's developer over power and energy contracts doesn't help Dominguez's cause, as the Alcantara Group owned by Dominguez's family, also has interests in the energy sector.

TPs Lowdown
While I do not possess the power to read minds, I cant help but suspect that Dominguez decisions, in light of his conflicts of interest, may not be in the best interest of the Filipino Public.

Dominguez and the Ayalas are billionaires who probably can afford flying in their own private jets at their most convenient time, but regular people like you and I fly commercial.

Only billionaires, Heads of State, and rappers and like Drake can afford private planes. All other humans fly commercial.
Like you, I have to suffer through the aviation hell that is the Ninoy Aquino International Airport every time I fly, the same NAIA that looks less like an airport and more like a can of sardines as each day goes by.

Unfortunately, it appears that our own Finance Secretarys interests do not coincide with those of the General Public, who wants nothing but a more humane commuting experience.

I do not care who builds a new airport as long as one is built. But if Dominguez keeps on blocking the construction of the new airport and insists that everyone use a congested NAIA or the Clark Airport thats light years away from the capital, then what we have in Dominguez is not a public servant, but a government official who, just like Secretary Salalima, must be fired.",RJ Nieto,"June 5, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/06/bulacan-aiport-duterte-dominguez-bajillion.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Hey Karen Davila, here's my reply to your complaint","Dear Karen Davila,

My manager spoke to me recently and he relayed to me what you had to say. It's funny that this is the second time you've tried to reach me through channels, even if you can very easily get hold of my phone number by calling our common friends.

Anyhow, here's what I've got to say in return.

Your latest complaint
The latest post you're complaining about is a blind item. You weren't named anywhere on that post, so why are you so affected? 

Note that I didn't cite the post here because I do not want to make that issue bigger than it should be, or for it to take on dimensions that I didn't intend it to take. I may be an asshole, but not 24-7.

Yes, the commenters tried to guess who that person is, but is it really ethical for me to suppress my followers' Freedom of Speech just because you didn't like what they say?

KAREN, U DAT?

Are you sure that Duterte is the dictator or is it some supposedly veteran journalist thats so onion-skinned, she wants to silence people who dont like her?

Going by your logic, should we blame you for the public ridicule that Alma Moreno and Manny Pacquiao had to suffer after they guested in your show?

Karen, please check the constitutionality of your requests before you blurt them out.

I personally think you have much to improve in your journalism, but I never crusaded for your involuntary silence.

Heck! I actually want you to talk even more because you, to put it lightly, amuse me every now and then. But contrary to what you would like to believe, I do not exist to torment you: it just so happens that you commit gaffes far more often than most high-profile journalists, and it would be hypocritical of me not to point them out.

Honestly, I haven't seen any other high-profile journalist commit the same kind of glaring mistakes that you do.

And why would I keep quiet about them? They are matters of Public Interest, and I am not indebted to you in any way, shape, or form.

A Code of Omerta
While it is true that there's supposedly an unwritten rule that journalists don't attack other journalists, I think that this rule doesn't apply to ""our"" case because:
First, you and your colleagues in traditional media don't consider us journalists but mere ""fake news purveyors"". Do you suddenly consider ""fake news purveyors"" as journalists when it's convenient for you?
Second, journalists should be able to take what they dish out. Are you telling me that you can't take criticism when criticizing people has been your job for decades? Have you never heard of Media Lens UK, Karen?
Third, you have talked about me unfavorably in your show several times, yet never have you respected my Right of Reply. Heck, you didnt even bother to ask my side on that episode about the October 2017 Fake News Senate Hearing, despite me being the topic of that specific episode.
Who was being unethical then, Karen? And you even have the gall to ask for fairness?

But that is not to mean that I exert no effort to be as fair as possible. 

As far as I can recall, I have never made up stuff about you. Everything Ive said about you were either based on publicly available footage or information that I have verified using at least two independent sources.

On your fake news about me
With that said, you told my manager that you were so hurt when I allegedly said Senator Trillanes bought you and your husband a pricey condominium unit. I find that funny because this was not the first time you brought that up.

About a year or so ago, you called a common friend to complain about that exact thing. I was with him when you were having the conversation.

Asked where you found that post, you said you saw it in ThinkingPinoy.info, which is not my site because I own as far as I can recall only ThinkingPinoy with the top-level domains .com, .net, .org, .com.ph, .net.ph, and .org.ph, specifically to prevent copycats from using my brand.
I specifically decided against purchasing rights over .info because any decent netizen will know that they usually are used by fake news sites so I do not wanna spend my money on protecting my brand from something that is unlikely to be a threat.

Do not blame me for your technological ignorance as your ignorance, technological or otherwise, is not my fault.


I vividly remember our common friend telling you that I never wrote that Trillanes-bought-you-a-condo issue because I do not own the source site you cited yet years later, you still insist that I did what I didnt.

Should I sue you for slander? But more importantly, why are you spreading fake news about me? Is that the kind of journalist that I should aspire to become, seriously? 

Am I really the one spreading fake news here, Karen? Should I call the CBCP so they can include you in their list?

Onion skin
You are arguably far more well-known than I am but I think that I have already suffered a sufficient amount of bashing, enough to have the right to tell you that public figures, especially those who willingly entered the limelight like you, should not be this onion-skinned.

When I was unfairly grilled on national TV by six senators for hours on end, have you ever seen me use the victim card? When Maria Ressa slandered me all over the world for god knows how many times already, have I ever cried for sympathy? When I was unjustly blamed during 2018 PH-Kuwait Diplomatic crisis for something that I didn't do, did I ever scream ""Woe is me!""?

No, I took all of them in stride. I let my followers decide whos the insecure liar.

Now, if you are still so convinced that I have unfairly and illegally maligned you, then please do yourself a favor: next time you complain, call me directly. 

But in case a multi-awarded journalist like you is too scared to talk to a huckster like me, please tell whoever common acquaintance youll call next the specific post and specific location concerning the specific thing youre complaining about.

Geez, Karen, the kind of complaining youve done so far smacks of bad journalism. A simple Who What When Where and How is an SOP: you dont just call random people and complain about something you cant even describe accurately.

Truth in journalism
You see, Karen, ThinkingPinoy started as a pedestrian putok-sa-buho who got so sick and tired of Mass Medias slanted reporting that he took it upon himself to call out the hypocrisy and the lies bombarding the masses every day.

Despite your visible dislike for our current president, be thankful that you work in the Philippines.

Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart, and even the much-ridiculed pundits of Fox News would have had a field day had you been working in the United States although that assumes you can, in one way or another, become famous enough to be within range of their radar.

And dont even get me started with the much more virulent European Press.

Karen, had you taken considerable and noticeable efforts to improve your journalism, I would have already forgotten all about you by now. But judging from your latest stunt with Vico Sotto, it appears that you really are the gift that keeps on giving.

When you so publicly expect so much from others like Manny Pacquiao and Alma Moreno, the public will also expect much from you.

I am part of that public.

Yes, I agree that I may not be as good as the person that I want you to become, but have you ever heard me complain to you about the flak I get from the public?

Despite all these
Despite everything Ive said so far, I actually am happy that you got to where you are right now. I know you have sacrificed a lot to achieve what youve achieved. I will not  and I have no plans to  take any of that from you. Your success is your success.

But getting to the top is easier than staying on top, and that second thing is the challenge youre facing today.

Will you stay on top by complaining to lesser humans like me, or by honing your craft and stopping the hypocrisy?

Think about it.

And no, I do not hate you: I just want you to be better.

I want you to be a better journalist not for your own sake, but for the sake of those who watch you every day. Filipinos have suffered long enough, so please dont make them suffer any further.

Legit Journalists don't act the way you do right now.

Note that I have been intentionally vague here because I tried my best to minimize any embarrassment that this may cause you. Yes, despite everything I've written, I was actually trying my best to hold back.

WILL ABS-CBN CLOSE DOWN OR NOT?,"There's a win-win solution, actually.

While at the wake of my mentor Jojo A. Robles, I had a conversation with a friend who happens to be a talent at ABS-CBN She told me she doesn't agree with me with my stance on ABS-CBN prospective closure.

I will conceal my friend's identity for her own protection. For purposes of discussion, I'll call her ""Sunset"".

My friend was actually referring to article ""Angel Locsin v. Jimmy Bondoc: THINK, ANGEL, THINK!"", where I basically grilled ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin for her poorly-informed rebuke of singer Jimmy Bondoc's earlier post.


BONDOC VS LOCSIN
Locsin was reacting to Bondoc's post where the latter said he's ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"" after describing the network as ""a snake pit, where success is based on politics and sexual favors.""

Jimmy didn't mention ABS-CBN, but I think we all know what he really meant.

Several camps have alleged that bullying, sexual harassment, and fraud are rampant in ABS-CBN, and I personally encourage victims to come forward and file complaints.

Gretchen Fullido blazed the trail, and she's finding much success right now after a Quezon City Court indicted news anchor Ces Drilon and a couple of other ABS-CBN network executives for the libel Gretchen Filed.


SUNSET'S POINT
Going back to what Sunset was saying, she said that while Jimmy may be justified in raising several important issues, Jimmy should have been more circumspect in the words that he used.

Sunset explained that Jimmy, instead of just expressing his disgust over the alleged crimes happening within the media firm, insulted thousands of innocent workers who work there.

I think I got her point, and I think her point is valid.

Jimmy seems to have adopted a scorched earth strategy when he wrote that statement: instead of simply criticizing the network's owners and the corrup person inside it, his use of the words ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"", while striking, may indeed be a tad too much.

Let me explain why.

THE FRANCHISE ISSUE
Just like Pres. Rody Duterte, I want the Lopezes to pay back the billions of pesos they owe the government, the same billions that may prevent the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise next year. And the government pressuring the Lopezes into paying back the loans need not, and likely will not, result to ABS-CBN's closure.
The fact of the matter, however, is that there are so many ways to deal with that issue without requiring ABS-CBN to close down:

FIRST: The Lopezes can simply pay the money back, similar to the what Mighty Corporation did a few years ago. The Lopezes owe the government is a lot less than what Mighty had to pay back so it should be easier to settle.

If that happens, then closure would be unnecessary. Otherwise, this leads us to...

SECOND: Should the Lopez Group lack the necessary liquidity to settle the debts in time, they can sell off assets to meet the requirement. The Lopez Group is worth billions of pesos' so while it's true that a few billion pesos will hurt its balance sheets, I doubt that it's enough to run the company into the ground.

If that happens, then closure would be unnecessary. Otherwise, this leads us to...


THIRD: In the assumption that they cannot (or unwilling to) pay, the government can just added pressure by not renewing its franchise.

If the Lopezes yield then finito. Otherwise...

FOURTH: I've heard from the grapevine that the Lopezes have managed to acquire an obscure TV station with an active franchise as a Plan B in case ABS-CBN doesn't get renewed. However, I have checked various TV franchises and I see that they contain a Non-Transferability Clause which, in simpler terms, means no part of a TV franchise can be tranferred to anyone.

Should ABS-CBN insist on using the said franchise to legalize its operations, Congress can simply cancel that other franchise as its well within its powers to do so.

FIFTH: Should the Lopezes play dirty by bringing the issue to the Supreme Court, I can so far see only two things happening...
A. The High Court respects the separation of powers, so that it will not interfere with Congress' decision to revove that obscure network's franchise, or, 
B. The High Court gives the case due course, then PRRD can in theory just play as dirty as ABS-CBN. After all, PRRD would have already appointed 11 out of the 15 SC Justices by end of 2019, a year before ABS-CBN's current franchise expires.
The Lopezes should be well aware of the fourth and fifth points so if I were them, I would just pay back what I owe to spare me the trouble. That is, whichever way things go, it seems that the Lopezes will eventually end up paying, and paying resolves the issue.

THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
The worst-case scenario that I can see is the Lopez Family selling all or part of its 55% stake at ABS-CBN to someone else, i.e. ABS-CBN continues operating albeit with a new set of owners.

Based on ABS-CBN's 2018 General Information Sheet, the Lopez Group owns around 55% of ABS-CBN, or about 481 million common shares. That's worth about Php 9 billion using today's ABS-CBN share price of P18.60.

As far as I know, ABS-CBN owes the government-owned Development Bank of the Philippines Php 1.67 billion. Adding possible surcharges and penalties, I think Php 9 billion is more than enough to pay the loans back. 

The Lopezes, should they lack sufficiently liquidity today, can just self half of their stake and they'll have enough. The Lopezes may also opt to sell their almost one billion preferred shares, worth over Php 18 billion. They even opt to sell a mixture of both commo and preferred stocks. Moreover, the Lopezes may also secure a bank loan to finance the debt repayment, thereby avoiding the need to lose any control over the firm. 

THE LOWDOWN
Whichever way, it is clear here that while the repayment of the DBP loan may hurt the Lopezes, it is extremely unlikely that ABS-CBN will close down just because of it. 

Thus, I think that it was unnecessary for Jimmy to go as far as expressing his excitement of ABS-CBN's supposed closure. While we couldn't care less about how rich (or less rich) the Lopezes will be, we should also think about how the lowly salaried employees will feel as soon as they hear news that the network is about to close shop, even if it it likely won't.

Like President Duterte, I am a very practical person: I'd rather have erring citizens pay stuff back than crush them because latter doesn't really do anyone any good.

The point here is this: Jimmy may have gone overboard when he raised the issue of closure. If I were him, I would've said ""I am excited to see one of the richest abusive oligarchs fall down"" instead. That way, he would not have caused undue worry among the thousands of less affluent employees of the station. 

I myself take extra care when posting statements so I can minimize collateral damage.

Truth be told, I think it's safe to say that most ABS-CBN employees don't care who owns ABS-CBN, as long as they have a job, such as the single mother that relies solely on her ABS-CBN job to feed her five kids. Meanwhile, the government is after the Lopezes for their unpaid debts and not the Lopezes' employees. 

Hence, it would've been so much better if Jimmy focused solely on the Lopezes and the Lopezes alone. After all, it's the Lopezes who didn't pay back the loans and not their lowly employees.

Jimmy should've used more precise verbiage, as opposed to one that attacked not only his intended targets, but also those who he wants to protect. 

As for Angel, I stand by my statement that if she insists on inserting herself into politically-charged issues, I highly suggest that she read up a bit first.",RJ Nieto,"May 26, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/will-abs-cbn-close-down-or-not.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Angel Locsin v. Jimmy Bondoc: THINK, ANGEL, THINK!","Angel Locsin's retort to Jimmy Bondoc's post is disappointing, to say the least.

Background
Singer Jimmy Bondoc in a 22 May 2019 post said he's ""excited to see the biggest tv network close down"".


Bondoc raised three core issues concerning the network:

Rigged contests that are ""manipulated to suit the whims of hidden bosses"" or whose winners are pre-determined,
News for sale, where the ""highest bidder gets the (favorable) slant"" and where ""foreign groups are usually the victors"",
""Countless victims"", ranging ""from sexual harrassment to plain and simple bullying""

ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin reacts
While he didn't name which network it is, I think we all know he's referring to the media giant ABS-CBN that's under threat of closure after its 25-year congressional franchise expire in 2020 because earlier this year, Pres. Duterte said he'll object to the renewal of its franchise as he accused the network of swindling public funds.

In retaliation to Bondoc, ABS-CBN actress Angel Locsin said:

""The network might not be perfect but for you to be happy about thousands of people losing their jobs is pure evil.""



I find Locsin's reaction utterly amusing. I mean, did she just downplay criminal acts?

Locsin presumably read the entirety of Bondoc's post. While she admitted that the ""the network might not be perfect"", she never denied the widespread sexual harrassment, bullying, and criminal fraud that Bondoc accused the network of.


Did Locsin just dismiss these patently felonious practices as mere ""imperfections""?


Surely, sexual harassment, criminal fraud and bullying are issues that can never be justified because the networks creates ""thousands of jobs"", right?

First, Sexual harassment
Locsins words remind me of the Zamboanga del Norte Congressman Romeo Jalosjos.

As described in People v Jalosjos, Jalosjos in 1996 raped an 11-year-old girl in at least nine separate occasions, for which he was sentenced to decades of imprisonment.

The same Supreme Court decisions states that Jalosjos gave the girl an allowance every time he rapes her.

For example:
he asked her to fondle his penis while he caressed her breasts and inserted his finger into her vagina. After their shower, accused-appellant ate breakfast. He gave Rosilyn P5,000.00
Going by Locsins logic, Jalosjos might not be perfect but for us to be happy that the girl cant have a few thousand pesos every time shes raped is pure evil.

You are a woman, Miss Locsin, you should know better.

Miss Locsin, you didnt think that one through.

As for News for Sale and Bullying...

Angel never denied Bondocs accusation that the network slants news in favor of the highest bidder and just like Bondocs accusation of widespread sexual harassment in the firm.

Instead, Locsin very conveniently used the term imperfect to describe the network.
Aint that a little too easy, Miss Locsin? ABS-CBN News reaches millions of Filipinos on a daily basis. Did you, Miss Locsin, belittle the catastrophic effects of widespread disinformation just because ABS-CBN provides thousands of jobs?

And bullying, geez! Miss Locsin, no less than your father is a Person with Disability (PWD), and we all know that PWDs are very common victims of bullying. Thats why I was shocked to discover that you simply ignored Bondocs allegations of widespread bullying in ABS-CBN.


Have you nothing to say about the cases ABS-CBN anchor Gretchen Fullido filed against several network executives and Ces Orea-Drilon? A regional trial court has already indicted them on at least one of those cases, yet as far as I can recall, you said NOTHING about it.

Moreover, while I couldnt care less about whoever wins whatever ABS-CBN contest, I am just surprised to discover that you ignored Bondocs allegation that the network or its executives rig contests, as you yourself are a judge of the ABS-CBN'S Pilipinas Got Talent.


Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant.

But I'm not done yet.

On swindling public funds
Pres. Duterte accused ABS-CBN of swindling government funds. Angel, being a politically active aware individual after endorsing her nephew Neri Colmenares 2019 senatorial bid, should also be aware of this..


Citing massive unpaid loans from the government-owned Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Pres. Rody Duterte on 06 March 2019 said he will oppose attempts to renew the congressional franchise of Lopez-owned media giant ABS-CBN.

PRRD said:
""The franchise is up for renewal. You ask if I'll object? Yes, I will object! Unang-una, yung utang nila (sa DBP), tablahin natin yan?"" 
[TRANSLATION: The franchise is up for renewal. You ask if I'll object? Yes, I will object! First of all, their (DBP) loan, should we just forget about it?]
ABS-CBN's 25-year congressional franchise expires in 2020 and it needs to be renewed for the media giant to continue TV operations. TV franchises are given via Republic Acts passed by Congress... and PRRD, as the Chief Executive, has the option to veto Republic Acts.

Here's a partial list of unpaid DBP loans secured by the ABS-CBN owners Lopez Group:

1: Maynilad Water Services, Inc.: P710.86 million
Loan granted in 2001 and started to default in 2003. The Lopezes controlled maynilad until 2006. DMCI Homes and MVP's Metro Pacific Investments Corporation took over in 2007.


2: Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. (BayanTel): P591.81 million
Loan granted in 1995 and started to default in 2001. The Lopezes controlled Bayantel until Globe Telecom started to take over in 2012, with the government finally approving the takeover bid in 2015.


3: Central CATV Inc. (SKYcable)P207.10 million
Loan granted in 1997 and started to default in 2001. The Lopezes control Skycable a.k.a. Central CATV Inc up to this day.


4: Benpres Holdings Corporation (Lopez Group of Companies)P157. 95 million
Then called Benpres Holdings, DBP granted the loan in 1996. default started in 2002. The Lopez Group owns ABS-CBN, among Others.
The said DBP loans are over P1.67 billion in total.


Given these, did Locsin just say that we should overlook ABS-CBNs failure to pay P1.67 billion owed to the Filipino People just because ABS-CBN provides thousands of jobs?

Miss Locsin, you didnt think that one through.

Your nephew, the losing Otso Diretso senatoriable Neri Colmenares loves to paint himself as an anti-corruption advocate. By very publicly endorsing Colmenares, I can only surmise that you yourself are against corruption, right?

Now, how would you reconcile your anti-corruption stance with either your ignorance of matters that directly concern you or your giving a cold shoulder to what could be a monumental case of corruption?


Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant, so to give you the benefit of the doubt, lets just say you didnt think that one through.

Thousands of Jobs
Regardless of the points I raised in the previous sections, I cannot just ignore the fact that ABS-CBN does provide thousands of jobs of Filipinos.

My problem with your argument, however, is your apparent incognizance of the widespread and long-standing labor issues plaguing the network, specifically its Internal Job Market (IJM).


In 2010, ABS-CBN IJM Workers Union blasted the network for alleged unjust dismissals and worker harassment.

Union president Antonio Perez claimed that management had discriminately terminated, delayed, or rearranged work schedules of dozens of ABS-CBN IJM workers [ABS].

In a statement, the workers union said:
The management only offered regular status to selected workers, and it entails waiver of all complaints of the worker against the management, no back-pay or recognition of the delayed regular status supposed to be granted for those who served for long years already, among other conditions.
Lets cite another case, just for kicks.
In Fulache v ABS-CBN, where the Supreme Court said ABS-CBN forgot labor law and its realities and that it acted with patent bad faith in the case involving several retrenched cameramen, editors, and drivers, who accused the network of violating laws on regularization and engaging in unfair labor practices. 
The High Court ruled in favor of the unjustly terminated employees and ordered the network to pay damages.
Miss Locsin, you may have a distorted idea of the quality of the thousands of jobs that ABS-CBN offers, maybe because you only know of the rates paid to pretty frontline employees like you, but are you aware of the plight of those who work behind the camera?

Again, Miss Locsin, youre either severely hypocritical or aggressively ignorant, so to give you the benefit of the doubt, lets just say you didnt think that one through too.

Think, Miss Locsin, think... and only after then should you talk. Don't contribute to the misinformation. Please try to see beyond your nose.

The Bikoy Saga: Will Gretchen Ho dare to bite the American hand that fed her?,"Are Gretchen Ho and Hidilyn Diaz as innocent as innocent goes?
UPDATE 1: Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo on 10 May 2019 exculpated Hidilyn Diaz and Gretchen Ho from the supposed destabilization plot. Despite this development, the data provided in this article, along with the ensuing analysis, still stand.
UPDATE 2:  I wrote this article because my research showed that prior to the first update (see abov), I felt that I may still give Panelo and Andanar the benefit of the doubt. Panelo's latest announcement, however, made that unncessary. Given the colossal incompetence that PCOO and OPS displayed these past few days, I am seriously considering starting an online petition requesting President Duterte to fire key people in his Strategic Communications team. 
UPDATE 3: Online change.org petition ""PRRD, please fire your Strategic Communications people."" has been published. If you want to read or sign the petition, CLICK HERE.

In a Malacaang press briefing held earlier this week, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo showed to media a matrix containing names of personalities allegedly involved in a destabilization plot against the Philippine Government.

Among the names in the matrix were those of ABS-CBN anchor Gretchen Ho and Olympic weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz.

I admit that I was surprised to find their names on the matrices and I cannot help but be frustrated by the fact that the PCOO and OPS released so many names without providing any significant substantiation for the allegations.

But then, we already know that PCOOs Strategic Communications and Social Media teams have continuously demonstrated mind-numbing incompetence since President Duterte, so thats not news.

Senator Ping Lacsons 09 May 2019 tweet perfectly encapsulates my sentiments of that day:
Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz has brought honor to the country while journalist Gretchen Ho has carved out a name for herself in her field, both through discipline and hard work. Their inclusion in the matrix either involved excellent intelligence work or Bikoy had infiltrated NSA.


Whats news, however, is that thing about Diaz and that Ho.

Diaz and that Ho react to Panelo
In response to Panelos matrix, Gretchen Ho on 08 May 2019 tweeted:
So ano ba talaga?  Am I trying to OUST or SUPPORT the government?
Attached to her tweet were screenshots of the Panelos destabilization plot matrix and a photo with the president taken recently in Malacaang.



Miss Ho, let me remind you that the invitation only mentioned ""celebrities"" and nowhere was it stated that only ""pro-Duterte"" were invited.

Meanwhile, Hidilyn Diaz in an interview with ABS-CBN News said:
Sino si Rodel Jayme? Hahaha di ko po kilala. Lol nakakatawa naman
Given these, its safe to say that the overarching theme of their respective responses is that both women have nothing to do about anything even remotely associated with destabilizing the Duterte Administration.

Even I, at first, was inclined to agree, as Spox Panelo himself cannot explain why the two sportswomen were included in the matrix.

With that said, I decided to check if these two are as innocent as innocent goes.


First, lets check Hidilyn Diaz
Hidilyn Diaz is best known for winning a silver medal in weightlifting during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As far as I can recall, she rarely talks about politics as she mostly spends her time in training sessions and international competitions.

Earlier today, however, a Thinking Pinoy follower emailed me a photo of Hidilyn wearing a Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation (Yellow Boat) t-shirt which, I admit, roused my curiosity over Hidilyns potential involvement in the foundation.

Diaz (middle) wearing a Yellow Boat t-shirt. To her right and wearing jeans is Yellow Boat Founder Anton Lim.
According to a 25 August 2018 Yellow Boat blog post [Archived]:
Congratulations to our Hope Paddler, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz for winning the Philippines first gold in the 2018 Asian Games! We are very proud of your feat!
As it turns out, Hidilyn is part of Yellow Boat.




As extensively discussed in the 07 May 2019 ThinkingPinoy article NBI Cybercrime, you may have missed this BIGGER Bikoy-linked fake news website, Yellow Boat is linked to the fake news Facebook page Now You Know (NYK), one of the pages who helped the most in spreading the black propaganda video series Ang Totoong Narco List.



n that article, I showed that NYK shares a small office with Yellow Boat Foundation, with NYKs site administrator Jerry Mae Maghinay  who was also mentioned in Panelos Matrix  also working for Yellow Boat.

In short, Hidilyn is a part of an organization with credible links to alleged destabilizer social media organization NYK.

Hidilyn Diaz may be truthful in her not knowing who Rodel Jayme is, but she sure knows people who enabled the proliferation of a scurrilous libel against the State.

What we see here is that contrary to what is being painted in most media outlets today, Hidilyn is not totally unrelated to personalities who are strongly involved the Bikoy Videos.

However, as to whether she knowingly participated in any destabilization attempt, is still up to Panelo and Andanar to prove.

That's not my problem: that's PCOO's.

Second, lets check Gretchen Ho
Gretchen Ho rose to fame when she became a member of the Ateneo de Manila University varsity volleyball team and eventually, a host and reporter for ABS-CBN News.

Gretchen Ho is a known critic of the administration, but simply criticizing the Duterte Administration is not enough to show complicity in any significant destabilization attempt. I, for myself, criticize the Administration a lot, especially its incompetent officials in the PCOO.

A little background check on Gretchen, however, reveals a major conflict of interest.



In a 22 November 2018 instagram post, the United States Embassy in Manila announced:
TV host and #HappiNews Ambassador @gretchenho is traveling to the United States for the #IVLP Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists on Media Responsibility in an Age of Disinformation. #USPHexchanges70

US Embassy Manila's Instagram 22 November 2018 post announcing the grant awarded to Gretchen Ho.

The Edward R. Murrow Program
Given that the Presidents independent foreign policy clashes directly with US interests, the fact that the State Department funds the exchange program is a red flag in itself.

In an August 2018 Philippine Star report, President Duterte reiterated his accusation that the United States, particularly its Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is monitoring his mobile phone conversations, insinuating that the agency might plot to kill him.

But of course, assassinations are messy, so why not death by a thousand miniature cuts?

And with each cut being an anti-Duterte journalist who regularly spews an anti-Duterte content?

Now, according the United States Department of State website [Archived]:
Each year, the U.S. Department of State's Edward R. Murrow Program for Journalists brings more than 100 emerging international journalists from around the world to examine journalistic practices in the United States. The Murrow program is an innovative public-private partnership between the Department of State, the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, and several leading U.S. schools of journalism. The program usually occurs in October-November of each year.
What makes matters worse, however, is that the US State Department administers the program in partnership with the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, which receives funding from CIA-linked and State Department-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED).

NEDs CIA links have been extensively discussed in the 29 April 2019 ThinkingPinoy article How much has Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, CMFR received from CIA offshoot?.

Let me state this simply:
Gretchen Ho benefitted from the same CIA-linked organization that funds Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler and CMFR.
To hammer the point home, let me quote the State Departments official description of the application process for the Edward Murrow Program:
""There is no application for the Edward R. Murrow Program. Participants are nominated and selected annually by the staff at U.S. Embassies around the world based on their journalistic accomplishments and potential to advance relationships between their country and the United States.
Judging from this, the United States sees Gretchen Ho as someone who can potentially advance relationships between [the Philippines] and the United States, which, as many would likely agree, is a more diplomatic way of saying Ho can advance US interest in the Philippines.

Duterte is at odds with the United States and theres no sign of Philippine Foreign Policy returning to its historically very pro-US stance but we all know that Philippine Foreign Policy may change when the Duterte administration is replaced.

Now let me ask the following questions:
In that light and as a journalist who likes to believe that she sways Public Opinion, what exactly can Gretchen do to advance US interests in the Philippines?
More specifically, what exactly does the United States expect Gretchen Ho to do after it gave her a prestigious scholarship grant?
Will Gretchen Ho ever support Dutertes Independent Foreign Policy despite the Americans expecting her to support American interests? 
Is Gretchen Ho willing to forsake any future US grants similar to the one she received last year?
Simply put, will Gretchen Ho even dare to bite the hand that fed her?
Surely, a supposedly legit journalist like Gretchen Ho must have made herself aware of the expectations associated with receiving US State Department grant.
What's the point of all these?
I am not saying that Gretchen Ho and Hidilyn Diaz have any significantly active participation in any destabilization plot. However, the findings in the previous sections show that these twos inclusion in the matrix may not have come totally out of left field.

I am in no way disapproving of foreign grants to Filipino citizens, but when the foreign power has CORE INTERESTS that directly clash with those of the Filipino People, then I have a problem with that.

Likewise, I am in no way disapproving of being part of charitable organizations, but when theres credible evidence showing that the charitable organization is heavily linked with a destabilizer, then I have a problem with that.

Suffice it to say, it is still up to the PCOO Sec. Martin Andanar and Presidential Spokesperson Sal Panel to fully substantiate their myriad claims during the fateful press briefing.

But to say that Hidilyn Diazs and Gretchen Hos inclusion in the matrix is totally unfounded, that the two are as pure as snow, is just like Esquire calling Maria Ressa the Sexiest Woman Alive in 2010.

Let me say this in plain Taglish:
Kahit ako man ay nagulat nang mapangalanan sina Diaz at Ho, pero takang-taka ako na ang portrayal sa kanila ng media ay tila wala silang kahit anong bahid ng koneksiyon sa kahit sinong involved sa matrix, samantalang malinaw na mayroon. Hindi ko sinasabing may kinalaman sila sa destabilization plot, pero hindi ko matanggap, batay sa publicly available data, na walang-wala silang kahit anong koneksiyon sa kahit kanino.",RJ Nieto,"May 10, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/thebikoysaga-will-gretchen-ho-dare-to.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake

In the 03 May 2019 Thinking Pinoy article Hey NBI, heres a new lead for your Bikoy Video investigation, a response to the Philippine Star article cited above, I earnestly attempted to help law enforcement by giving leads on some of these websites, with particular attention to the erstwhile totally anonymous Change Scamming blog.

The four-part Ang Totoong Narco List video series are more commonly known as the Bikoy Videos.

I thought it was over, until I stumbled upon another site which, judging from the dates of its posts and the engagement the posts garnered, may also qualify as a front runner like the five previously mentioned.

And I am referring to Now You Know, with Facebook handle @NowYouKnowPh.

That is, in terms of potential propaganda damage caused, Now You Know dwarfs each of the these three websites mentioned in the NBI report.

Video Title: The ""true"" narco list?

Video Description:
A week ago, Now You Know did a story on ex-cop Eduardo Acierto's testimonies exposing the alleged involvement of certain Chinese Nationals in the illegal drug trade in the Philippines. Among them is the controversial former ""economic adviser"" of President Duterte, Michael Yang. Acierto also floated names of political personalities such as the former Special Assistant to the President Bong Go.

Today, NYK received another video presenting a testimony of a certain ""BIKOY"" (not his real name) who claims to be a former member of a big drug syndicate that operates in Southern Luzon and Visayas region. Bikoy presented in the video ""the true narcolist"" along with other documents that lead to big names behind certain illegal drug transactions.

Showing a series of evidences, Bikoy's camp claims that Presidential Son Paolo Duterte is one of the names behind such operations.

Video Title: 2nd part: The ""true"" narco list?

Video Description:
After exposing the alleged involvement of Presidential son Paolo Duterte in the illegal drug trade in the country as indicated in the TARA--an internal document used by the drug syndicate in their financial transactions--the second part of the expos reveals another name from the Duterte family.

In this video NYK received today, ""BIKOY"" (not his real name) reveals that Presidential daughter Kitty Duterte also ""gets a part"" in the illegal drug trade as she allegedly hides behind the name of Veronica Salvador.

Meanwhile, Paolo Duterte in his social media post on Tuesday responded and lashed out at a certain J.S., whom he tagged as being behind the video detailing his supposed connection to a drug syndicate.
Wow ha kung makaimbento ka wagas. Galit ka kay Waldo kasi binabara niya lahat ng smuggling mo ng bigas at asukal diba J.S.,"" wrote Duterte.

Who is Now You Know?
According to its About Page:
NOW YOU KNOW (NYK) is an online civic media platform managed by volunteers that delivers relevant news and information on the burning issues of the day.
According to the same page, NYK was founded on 15 November 2018 with the mission:
To be the among the country's top factual information online hubs that encourage more Filipinos to be involved in important conversations on issues that impact their lives.
According to the same page, NYKs email is nowyouknowph@gmail.com and its website is www.nowyouknow.ph.
I tried to visit nowyouknow.ph but its a dead link. Not content with such a result, I checked its WhoIs data.

The usual ICANN WhoIs search wont yield any significant data since NowYouKnow.ph uses a Philippine top-level domain (.ph).


Instead, the right way to do it is to go to Dot.Ph, the official domain name registry of the Philippines, and used its Dot.Phs internal WhoIs tool, and thats what I did.


Typing in nowyouknow.ph and hitting the search button, I got this:

Background checking the registration details
Though riddled with typographical errors, its clear that the registrants name is a certain Jerry Mae Maghinay from 2515 the linear Makati T2.

I checked for a social media profile under ""Jerry Mae Maghinay"" and I found this:


Now, it's possible that she's not the same Maghinay mentioned in the WhoIs records.

However, scrolling down her public timeline shows a 28 March 2019 post [Archived] as shown below:


Either this is the same Maghirang or its just one gigantic coincidence that I sincerely doubt.
Why is this relevant?
Well, a google search for Jerry Mae Maghinay [Archived] doesnt yield any significant results. A search for 2515 the linear Makati T2 [Archived], however, does yield some very interesting information.




More specifically, this writer discovered a volunteer organization database entry [Archived] about a certain project called YBH BANGKARUNUNGAN & SOLAR LAMPS TUNROVER (SITIO LIPATA CARAMOAN) with the following contact information:

YELLOW BOAT OF HOPE FOUNDATION
Mae A. Maghinay
09290761859
chief.hopepaddler@yellowboat.orgYellow Boat of Hope Foundation
In short, available data suggests that the Maghinay mentioned in the WhoIs data is the same as the Maghinay I found on Facebook. Here's one of the photos of herself that she shared publicly [Archived]:


The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation
Next thing I did was to background check Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation.

The said foundation described itself in its about page that partly reads:
The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation, formerly referred to as the The Philippine Funds for Little Kids, started as a national movement to help children who used to swim to school in the mangrove village of Layag-Layag, Brgy. Talon-Talon, Zamboanga City.
Zamboanga? This may partly explain the seeming typographical error in NowYouKnow.PH's WhoIs registry entry.

At the bottom of the page is the foundations address and contact information [Archived], and I quote:
Suite 2515, The Linear Makati Tower 2, Yakal cor.
Mayapis St. Makati City, PHILIPPINES, 1607
chief.hopepaddler@yellowboat.org
www.yellowboat.org

A deeper look at Yellow Boat
Heres what can be gleaned from the foundations website:
Yellow Boat is an Angat Buhay partner, according to its 13 April 2019 blog post [Archived] where it thanked Vice-president Leni Robredo. Angat Buhays flagship project [MB].
Meanwhile, the foundations two founders are Anton Mari H. Lim, DVM and Jay Michael O. Jaboneta, according to its Board and Management page [Archived].

Yellow Boat co-founders Anton Lim (left) and Jay Jaboneta (right).

Yellow Boat's founders are very interesting.

According to a 16 February 2011 post by The Asia Foundation [Archived], Yellow Boat co-founder Anton Mari H. Lim, DVM is on the board member of People Power Volunteers for Change  campaign supporters who have organized themselves to help President (Benigno) Aquinos administration.

During Pres. Benigno Aquinos incumbency, Lim was also a commissioner of the EDSA People Power Commission [PhilStar|Archived], a government agency tasked with institutionalizing the legacy of the EDSA People Power Revolution[EO 82 s.99]

During the Noynoy Aquino administration, Yellow Boat co-founder Anton Lim was a commissioner of the People Power Commission.

Meanwhile, the other co-founder Jay Michael Jaboneta in his personal website [Archived] describes himself as the first and former Director for New Media under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) and started the team that managed Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino IIIs official website and social networking presence.
Yellow Boat Foundation co-founder Jay Jaboneta in 2011 receives the ""Liberal Project Award"" from  the Friedrich Nauman Foundation, an affiliate of the Liberal Party of the Philippines. Handing the award is then Senator and LP President Franklin Drilon. Witnessing the event is then Transportation Secretary Emilio ""Jun"" Abaya.
The Yellow Boat Foundations founders are heavily linked with the Aquino Administration as both held appointive positions in pro-Aquino propaganda arms, namely the Aquino-era People Power Commission and the Aquino-era PCOO.


What just happened?
Before you get confused, lets consolidate what weve found out so far.

Judging from the timing of NowYouKnows five uploads related to the four-part Ang Totoong Narco List video series, along with the engagement each video received to date, I think the National Bureau of Investigation Cybercrime Division should also take a look at NowYouKnows potential complicity.

To help law enforcement with this prospective investigation, I checked for leads by tracing the ownership of NowYouKnows official website, NowYouKnow.ph.




The search led me to a registrant named Jerry Mae Maghinay with address at 2515 The Linear Makati T2, Makati City.

Now, publicly available data shows that NowYouKnow shares addresses with The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation, whose two founders Anton Lim and Jay Michael Jaboneta are not just Aquino supporters, but Aquino appointees.

Aside from the common address, is NowYouKnow totally unrelated to The Yellow Boat of Hope?

Apparently not, as publicly available data cited in the previous sections show that NowYouKnows registrant also works for The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation.

Now, it is interesting to note that The Linear Makati is a high-rise residential condominium complex whose biggest unit design is just 49 square meters, according to its developer's website.

Diagrams of units at The Linear Makati. Source: aspirebyfilinvest.com

This 49-sqm area is just 7x7 meters which, in my opinion, is pretty small to house two organizations, unless  the two organizations are basically one and the same or  they are significantly independent from each other but their respective management teams dont mind packing all their employees into such a tight space.

With that said, I think the NBI should ask a few questions to the people whose names were mentioned above because based on my years of experience as a social media practitioner, the damage that NowYouKnow caused on the credit of the state is no laughing matter.

We need to find an answer to this question:
Is the LP-linked Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation moonlighting as a black propaganda organization?
That's what I would personally like to know.",RJ Nieto,"May 7, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/nbi-cybercrime-you-missed-this-bigger.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Hey NBI, heres a new lead for your Bikoy Video investigation","Hey NBI guys, I heard you're looking for other people, so let me humbly give you a few leads that you may have overlooked.
Note to Mr. Rodel Jayme: for your own sake, better spill the beans ASAP so you can still become a state witness.  Your would-be testimony may become unnecessary very soon.
Other websites of interest
According to a Philippine Star article, you noted in the complaint that the libelous and seditious Ang Totoong Narcolist video was posted by different social media sites, 'having the front runners to wit:'
Pinoy Ako Blog
Change Scamming
Metro Balita
Madam Claudia
What the FACT blog
Furthermore, you guys said, ""Continuous efforts were conducted to uncover personalities behind these accounts. Recently, crucial information on METRO BALITA were gathered. Hence, emphasis and focus were made.

From what I understand, you dealt with Metro Balita first because information about it was already on your hands, which suggests that you are still digging for information about the others.


A little housekeeping

Because I am a law-abiding citizen who wants to help the government enforce the law, let me give you guys a few leads in case you need them but lets deal with the preliminary stuff first.

First, I have no data so far about What the Fact blog so I cannot help you with that yet. Give me a little more time for that.


Second, you already know who's behind MetroBalita: Rodel Jayme, the guy you arrested recently.


Third, two of Pinoy Ako Blog's owners/operators are already known (Jover Laurio and Cocoy Dayao). There are at least two others, but Laurio and Dayao are already a good start.

Fourth, Madam Claudia used to run Google Ads under the AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134. In my 29 Sept 2017 #CocoyGate article ""#CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for"", I was able to connect the dots and show that it's very likely owned by Cocoy Dayao.

If you want to know how I traced these, see the following video:


So you have three names so far: Rodel Jayme, Cocoy Dayao, and Jover Laurio.


Now that were done with housekeeping, lets get to the more interesting part.

Who is behind Change Scamming?
As was shown in the 29 September 2017 ThinkingPinoy article #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for, Change Scamming used to run Google Ads under the AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134 (Check the #CocoyGate article in the previous paragraph).



From that same article, I also discovered, using a reverse Google AdSense Lookup, that ads linked to AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134 were served not only in ChangeScammings website, but also in at least ten other websites, namely:
AnuNaBes.com
DiKukurap.com
DotReport.org
DuterteAdminNews.com
FightForTruth.club
FixPH.org
PilipinongPalaban.com
PolitikangInaMo.com
SocialPatrol.ph
Kolektibo.com
Check the following video if you want to know how I did that:


As far as I know, a person can register under his name one AdSense account at the maximum, so Cocoy couldn't possibly own AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 if already owns ca-pub-8283971809912134.

Moreover, Cocoy has already admitted in the past that he owns ProPinoy.net, which already served under Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-8283971809912134. That is, Cocoy must own the account with that number, so that somebody else must own the account with Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996.

And that's what this article is about.

Domain Privacy Protection 101
While researching for that 2017 article, I checked the domain registration details of each of these 10 websites, only to discover that they all use a domain privacy protection service. Hence, I hit nothing but dead ends.

The said service is identical to the one I used for ThinkingPinoy.net so that I can avoid spam calls and emails if my contact details are out in the open for everyone to see. 

Here, look at the WhoIs Information of ThinkingPinoy.net with active Domain Privacy Protection:

As you can see, the registration details are those of my Domain Privacy Protection Service provider, instead of my own contact information.

Yes, domain privacy protection services mask the real name and contact information of website owners, but they are paid services that need to be renewed as soon as or preferably even before they expire, as neglecting to do so would reveal the true details of the websites owner.

On 03 May 2019, or two years after writing the article mentioned above, I re-checked if any of the domain privacy protection services of the ten websites linked to Change Scamming have expired.

And as it turns out, one of them did.

Expired Domain Privacy: Kolektibo.com
Domain Privacy Services for the first nine websites (from AnuNaBes.com down to SocialPatrol.Ph) have always been active. However, the one for Kolektibo.com lapsed, at least for a period long enough to reveal the sites true owner.

Suffice it to say, I checked for the WhoIs history of Kolektibo.com using the third-party online utility DomainTools.com. Here's what I did:



According to its WhoIs History, Kolektibo.com was first registered  with domain privacy protection  on 08 August 2017. Domain privacy protection was in effect for an entire year, until it lapsed on 19 September 2018.

On that exact day, Kolektibo.coms domain registration showed not the placeholder information typical of websites with domain privacy, but the actual name and contact details of the real person who owns the said website.

Let me quote part of the WhoIs record of Kolektibo.com, according to DomainTools:
Domain name: kolektibo.com
Domain name: kolektibo.com
Registrant Name: Sidney Zosa
Registrant Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center
Registrant City: Pasig City
Registrant Phone: +63.9151350194
Registrant Email: sidney.zosa@gmail.com 
Admin Name: Sidney Zosa
Admin Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center

Tech Name: Sidney Zosa
Tech Organization:
Tech Street: 1409 AIC Gold Tower, Ortigas Center
Tech Phone: +63.9151350194
Tech Email: sidney.zosa@gmail.com

What should be done to Sidney Zosa?
According to the websites WhoIs History as reported by DomainTools, a certain Sidney Zosa owns, administers, and maintains Kolektibo.com, a website that earned money by serving online advertisements under Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996.

Recall that Change Scamming, the website youre investigating, also served online advertisements using the same Google AdSense Publisher ID.

Now, heres an important (rhetorical) question:
If I were a website owner, would I let my sites ad earnings go to somebody else?
Sidney Zosa owns Kolektibo.com, so that money earned via Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 should go to him, unless he is just an employee or associate of someone higher up the food chain.



Google AdSense Terms of Service corroborate this observation, and agreement to these terms is a prerequisite for owning an AdSense account.

More specifically, part of the Philippine version of the Google AdSense Terms of Service states [AdSense]:
13. Mga Pagkakatawan; Mga Warantiya; Mga Pagtatanggi 
Kinakatawan mo at ginagarantiya na  ikaw ang may-ari ng, o legal na may pahintulot na kumilos sa ngalan ng may-ari ng ng bawat Ari-arian;  ikaw ang teknikal at pang-editoryal na nagpapasya kaugnay ng bawat Ari-arian kung saan ang Mga Serbisyo ay ipinatupad at mayroon kang kontrol sa paraan ng pagpapatupad ng Mga Serbisyo sa bawat Ari-Arian
Translating this to English
13. Representations; Warranties; Disclaimers 
You represent and warrant that  you are the owner of, or are legally authorized to act on behalf of the owner of, each Property;  you are the technical and editorial decision maker in relation to each Property on which the Services are implemented and you have control over the way in which the Services are implemented on each Property
Based on this document, either:
 Sidney Zosa owns the AdSense Account, or
 he legally authorized somebody else to administer his AdSense for him. 
A little logic
If Zosa owns the AdSense account, then he must also be the editorial decision maker of Change Scamming, as those AdSense Terms and Conditions applies to all properties (websites) in which Google Ads are served (i.e. Change Scamming). That is, if Zosa admits to owning the AdSense account, then hes the guy behind Change Scamming, the exact guy youre looking for.

Now, if he legally authorized somebody else to administer his AdSense, then he must tell you who it is if he doesnt want to be implicated in this scandal.

Now, suppose he gives you another name, then that other person would be the owner of Google AdSense Publisher ID ca-pub-1068157602481996 (pending verification with Googles officers, of course).

Again, by virtue of the same Google AdSense Terms of Service, that ""other person"" would be the technical and editorial decision maker in relation to Change Scamming.

Ask Zosa about who he has closely worked with in the past, most especially in tech-related projects.

For example, the website Lawhackers.co featured a technological startup called Supra and the writeup reads [Archived]:

Supra is a learning app for law students in the Phillipines, currently covering 38 volumes of the Civil Law Bar. It brings neat aesthetics and great navigation to create an amazing learning experience that is the first of its kind. 
Founders: Sidney Zosa and Mars Veloso 
Launched: 2014
Made in: Tacloban, Phillipines (sic)

Is the owner of the Google AdSense account behind Change Scamming Sidney Zosa, Mars Veloso, or somebody else?

With that said, I highly recommend that you guys contact Zosa and ask him a few questions.

Available evidence currently points to him, but please accord him due process.

You are not Rappler, after all.",RJ Nieto,"May 3, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/05/rodel-jayme-nbi-bikoy-investigation.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Fact-checking the fact-checker: Over 50% of Vera Files funding from CIA-linked orgs,"Why don't we fact-check the fact-checker?

In a Facebook Newsroom post, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said [FB]:
Our partners are independent and certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network.
One of the core requirements to become a Facebook fact-checker is membership in the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) of the Florida-based Poynter Institute for Media Studies.

In fairness to Lyons, she also acknowledged allegations of bias among the websites fact checkers when she, in the same newsroom post, said:
While we work with the International Fact-Checking Network to approve all our partners and make sure they have high standards of accuracy, fairness and transparency, we continue to face accusations of bias.
The social network currently has two fact-checkers in the Philippines: Rappler and Vera Files.

In this article, we will examine Vera Files.

IFCN Code of Principles: Nonpartisanship Policy
Poynter-IFCN has a Code of Principles that it describes as a series of commitments organizations abide by to promote excellence in fact-checking [IFCN].

Each IFCN member is required to adhere to this Code, determined through yearly assessments.

According to the IFCN website, Vera Files co-founder and UP Journalism professor Yvonne Chua submitted an application of behalf of her organization. This was assessed  and approved  by IFCN external assessor Jeremaiah M. Opiniano, a Journalism assistant professor at the University of Santo Tomas.
A screenshot of Vera Files' application sent to the Poynter Institute's International Fact-checking Network.
Opiniano assessed and approved Vera Files applications twice: once in 2017 and another time in 2018.

Part of the IFCN code of ethics is a nonpartisanship policy, which requires applicants to share evidence of your policy preventing staff from direct involvement in political parties and advocacy organizations.

In response, Vera Files in its 2017 application said (Criterion 2b):
We dont take money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

Vera Files reiterated this claim in its 2018 application (Criterion 2b), where it stated:
VERA Files prohibits its trustees and staff from taking money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups...
A screenshot of Vera Files' attestation of nonpartisanship in its 2018 IFCN application 
The problem, however, is that a closer look at its finances show that it may have been lying in both 2017 and 2018.

Lets discuss this in greater detail.

Vera Files Funding Sources
Section 4 of the IFCN Code of Principles application form, entitled Transparency of Funding & Organization, requires Vera Files to disclose funding sources.

To address this in its 2017 application, Vera Files submitted its 2016 SCHEDULE OF CONTRIBUTIONS/DONATIONS - PRIVATE ENTITIES that listed five sources of funding.

Vera Files' 2016 funding sources are as follows:
National Endowment for Democracy (NED): Php 2,539,050.00.
World Health Organization (WHO): Php 1,998,879.79
The Asia Foundation (TAF): Php2,101,401.00
Reporters Without Borders Germany (RWB): Php 736,299.58
Others: Php 1,001,891.10
A screenshot of the Funding Source Document Vera Files submitted to IFCN in 2017. 

In its 2018 application, Verafiles listed three sources for 2017 funding, namely:
National Endowment for Democracy: Php 4,034,313.00
World Health Organization: Php 1,683,150.00
Others: Php 1,132,892.29

A little arithmetic shows that Vera Files:
derived 54% of its 2016 private funding from NED and TAF
derived 59% of its 2017 private funding from NED alone.
Now, lets examine these two major funders.

Vera Files Funder #1: National Endowment for Democracy
NED, in its About page, describes itself as a private, nonprofit foundation dedicated to the growth and strengthening of democratic institutions around the world [NED].

The description sounds innocuous enough.

However, in his 2008 piece entitled NED et. al.: The CIAs Successors and Collaborators, published in both the Canadian Centre for Global Research and Globalization (Global Research) and the French Le Monde Diplomatique, Hernando Calvo Ospina wrote [GlobalResearch]:
When a scandal in the 1980s revealed the CIAs 35 years of international manipulations, President Ronald Reagan established the National Endowment for Democracy as a more discreet and less controversial instrument. It had the same purpose  to destabilise unfriendly governments by funding the opposition... Although legally an NGO, the NED was funded from the State Department budget, subject to congressional approval
But thats coming from a NED critics, so lets cite the statement of NED people themselves.
In a 1991 interview with the Washington Post, NED founder and theoretical planner Allen Weinstein said [WaPo]:
A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.
Weinsteins statement basically means NED is an offshoot of the US Central Intelligence Agency.


The NED of today affirms this, as the History section of its About page states [NED]:
In the aftermath of World War II. U.S. policy makers resorted to covert means, secretly sending advisers, equipment, and funds to support newspapers and parties under siege in Europe. When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly.
That is, NED does today what the CIA did beforehand.

According to NED's Awarded Grants Database, NED's grants to Vera Files are specifically intended for the latter's fact-checking operations [NED | Archived]:

A Screenshot of NED's list of grants to Vera Files.

Vera Files Funder #2: The Asia Foundation
According to its own website, the Asia Foundation is a nonprofit international development organization committed to improving lives across a dynamic and developing Asia [AF].

Like NED, the description sounds sufficiently harmless.

A 1977 New York Times article Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A. detailing Asia Foundations beginnings, however, suggests otherwise, as it states [NYT]:
The Asia Foundation was headed for years by the late Robert Blum who, several sources said, resigned from the C.I.A. to take it over. The foundation provided cover for at least one C.I.A. operative and carried out a variety of mediarelated ventures, including a program, begun in 1955, of selecting and paying the expenses of Asian journalists for a year of study in Harvard's prestigious Neiman Fellowship program.
Side Note: The managing editor of Rappler (the other Facebook fact-checker in the Philippines), Glenda Gloria, is a 2018 Neiman Fellow [Rappler], and NED also funds Rappler.
A screenshot of the 1977 New York Times article Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A. detailing Asia Foundations beginnings.
A more informative description can be found in the declassified 2000 CIA document that states [CIA]:
The Asia Foundation was originally a creation of the Executive Branch intended to promote U.S. Foreign Policy Interests in the region
A screenshot of the declassified 2000 CIA document describing The Asia Foundation.

The same CIA document states that in 1975:
 the State Department appointed a panel of private citizens with Foreign Affairs experience to review the foundations record and potential for assisting in the achievement of U.S. objectives in Asia. The panel concluded that the foundation is an effective instrument for furthering of United States interests in Asia
A screenshot of the declassified 2000 CIA document describing The Asia Foundation.
In his 2011 paper published in the Journal of Anthropological Research [ResearchGate], Washington-based Saint Martin University Sociology and Anthropology professor Dr. David Price aptly cited Asia foundation as a CIA funding front.

Fact-checking the Fact-checker
Recall that Vera Files claimed in its 2018 IFCN application that it prohibits its trustees and staff from taking money from politicians, political parties or partisan groups.

Vera Files reiterated this claim in its own FAQ article What you want to know about VERA FILES FACT CHECK as Vera Files' response to the question:
How sure are we that youre not backed by a politician or political party?
But arent the National Endowment for Democracy and the Asia Foundation, both of whom are widely considered as instruments of U.S. Foreign Policy, political parties? 

Both sure are parties, and their respective histories shows they are very political.

The Collins Dictionary defines ""political party"" as ""an organization of people who share the same views about the way power should be used in a country or society"".


NED and TAF, being US Foreign Policy insturments, squarely fit into that description.

For the last two reporting periods (2016 and 2017), Vera Files has been sourcing over half of its operating expenses from these two organizations.

While Vera Files claims that it generates some income from sales, its 2016 Audited Financial Statement (AFS) shows that of the Php 7.8 million in 2016 revenues Php 7.3 million comes from Grants and Donations?

Moreover, Vera Files 2017 Audited Financial Statement shows that its entire Php 6.9 million in 2017 revenues are from Grants and Donations?

A screenshot of Vera Files' 2017 AFS showing revenue sources for 2016 and 2017. Note that virtually all of its revenues come from grants and donations.
And where do over half of these grants and donations come from?

NED and TAF.

A closer look at Vera Files 2016 AFS shows that it generated only Php 2.45 million in revenues in 2015, Php 2.3 million of which is from Donations and Grants.

A screenshot of Vera Files' 2016 AFS showing revenue sources for 2016 and 2015. Note that its revenues TRIPLED as after it received funding from NED and TAF.
That is, NED and TAF tripled Vera Files revenues starting in 2016 which, by the way, is the same year President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office.

This is especially relevant in Vera Files context because the Duterte Administration, i.e. the government of the jurisdiction within which Vera Files operates, is currently clashing with US Foreign Policy as Dutertes independent foreign policy upends Washingtons Pivot to Asia.

How in the world can Vera Files claim non-partisanship when it operates in the Philippines, a country whose Foreign Policy interests clash with those of Vera Files funders?

Should the Poynter Institute, which manages the International Fact-checking Network, reassess Vera Files eligibility as a Fact-checker given that Vera Files receives funding from political parties?

Oh, wait!

NEDs Awarded Grants Database shows Poynter has been receiving NED funding annually since 2015 [NED].

In short, Poynter-IFCN and Vera Files share the same sugar daddy.

"How much has Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, CMFR received from CIA offshoot?","Just how much funding have Vera Files, PCIJ, Rappler, and CMFR received from the US government-funded CIA offshoot National Endowment for Democracy (NED)?

Here's data from none other than NED itself.


But before that, let's get to know NED a little more.

NED as a CIA Successor and Collaborator
In his 2008 piece entitled NED et. al.: The CIAs Successors and Collaborators published in both the Canadian Centre for Global Research and Globalization (Global Research) and the French Le Monde Diplomatique, Hernando Calvo Ospina wrote [GlobalResearch]: 
When a scandal in the 1980s revealed the CIAs 35 years of international manipulations, President Ronald Reagan established the National Endowment for Democracy as a more discreet and less controversial instrument. It had the same purpose  to destabilise unfriendly governments by funding the opposition... Although legally an NGO, the NED was funded from the State Department budget, subject to congressional approval
Quoting former US Department of State official William Blum, Ospina wrote:
What was done was to shift many of the awful things [done by the CIA] to a new organisation, with a nice sounding name. The creation of the NED was a masterpiece. Of politics, of public relations, and of cynicism.
An Admission from NEDs founder
No less than NED's founder -- and NED itself -- admitted the claims in Ospina's article.

Asked about NED in a 1991 interview with the Washington Post, NED founder and theoretical planner Allen Weinstein said [WaPo]:
A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA. 
This is corroborated by no less than NED's official website in the History section of its About page [NED], part of which states: 
In the aftermath of World War II. U.S. policy makers resorted to covert means, secretly sending advisers, equipment, and funds to support newspapers and parties under siege in Europe. When it was revealed in the late 1960s that some American PVOs were receiving covert funding from the CIA to wage the battle of ideas at international forums, the Johnson Administration concluded that such funding should cease, recommending establishment of a public-private mechanism to fund overseas activities openly. 
PVO means Private Voluntary Organizations.

NED's Official Awarded Grants Database
NED has a database of grants that it has so far extended to Philippine organizations, and these include grants to four prominent Duterte Administration critics, namely: 
Vera Files, 
Rappler, 
Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR), and,
Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ).
Vera Files and Rappler are the two fact-checkers of Facebook in the Philippines.
Lets itemize each grant. Note that each dollar-denominated grant is also converted into Philippine pesos using a modest exchange rate of 51 pesos to a dollar.

[29 April 2019 | 09:11 P.M. GMT+8]  UPDATE ON PH MEDIA OUTFITS RECEIVING US GOVERNMENT FUNDING VIA CIA OFFSHOOT NED
It appears that National Endowment for Democracy (NED) Awarded Grants Database shows only grants awarded from 2014 onwards. It doesn't provide data for NED grants prior to 2014.

NED hikes funding during Duterte Administration
President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office in 2016. A known US critic, Duterte has made it clear from the onset of his term that he wants a independent foreign policy [TheDiplomat], characterized by lesser dependence on the US and greater co-operation with China.

This is a total departure from the historically pro-US stance of all of Duterte's predecessors since 1946, or when the US recognized Philippine independence, as discussed in the 09 September 2016 ThinkingPinoy article ""Duterte's Philippines breaking away from the United States?""

And true enough, NED since 2016 hiked funding for Philippine media outfits that strongly criticize the Duterte Administration.

Funding Stats
NEDs database shows only CMFR and PCIJ were funded with a total of $258,831 prior to 2016, broken down as follows:
CMFR: $152,000
PCIJ: $ 106,831
On the other hand, the four organizations  CMFR, PCIJ, Vera Files, and Rappler  received a total of $672,434 of funding since 2016, broken down as follows:
CMFR: $ 197,034
PCIJ: $ 135,800
Rappler: $ 142,000
Vera Files: $ 197,600
Here are some notable observations:
NED funding for PCIJ during Dutertes term is 29.6% more than all previous years combined.
NED funding for CMFR during Dutertes term is 27.1% more than all previous years combined.
Total NED funding for these four outfits during Dutertes term increased by 159.8% compared to all previous years combined.
Rappler received $142,000 in 2018 alone, which is more than NEDs total funding received by PCIJ since its inception.
Vera Files is the biggest recipient of NED funding among the four.
Should you bite the hand the feeds you?
NED has awarded a total of $931,265 (Php 47.5 million) to these four organizations. Moreover, over two-thirds of this amount ($672,434 / Php 34.3 million) was awarded from 2016 to 2018, i.e. during the Duterte Administration.

I have always wondered why Rappler, PCIJ, Vera Files, and CMFR have been very critical of the Duterte Administration since Day One. 

In light of the massive funding these four outfits have been receiving from the US Government, however, I finally stopped asking why.

Quoting American writer Upton Sinclair [QI]:
It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!
Will these four outfits ever dare to write anything thats blatantly against US interests?

Here's the complete step-by-step guide to uncovering Metro Balita's owner,"Two Manila Times columnists  former ambassador Rigoberto Bobi Tiglao and Maastricht University lecturer Sass Rogando Sasot  have written about this, but I like having all bases covered, so here we go.


In early April 2019, a series of videos with the common title Ang Totoong Narco List (Translation: The Real Narco List, now more popularly known as the Bikoy Videos circulated online.

The videos, through an anonymous informant with alias Bikoy, allege that members of the Duterte presidential family received massive drug payolas, including President Rodrigo Dutertes son Paolo Pulong Duterte, son-in-law Manases Mans Carpio, and 14-year-old daughter Veronica Kitty Duterte, a minor.
In her ABS-CBN News column, Facebook fact-checker Ellen Tordesillas of Vera Files said the videos were riveting and, along with the annotations, look professionally done.

It appears, however, that Tordesillass standards for professional video creation are skin-deep.


A look at the payola documents featured in the Bikoy videos show that these are just a bad a case of photoshop, as shown below [http://bit.ly/2UHwCig]:


Aside from the excellent lighting and choice of text overlays, the video itself is amateurish at best, as the supposed payola payout lists, which the entire video series relies upon for credibility, are just fake documents.

Potential Court Cases
Libel punishable under Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code is obvious, but given the videos online nature, parties can sue for Cyber Libel punishable under Section 4 of the Cybercrime Prevention Act (RA 10175).

Sasot also called for an RPC Article 154 test case in her 25 April 2019 Manila Times column Who is behind Metro Balita?.


I believe Sasot is justified as Bikoy Videos attempted to implicate no less the presidential family, whose integrity (or the perception of it) may be considered a national security concern. That is, parties may also sue for unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterances punishable under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 10951.

Aside from these, Veronica Kitty Duterte, being a minor, may also sue for violence against children punishable under Section 5 the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (RA 9262), which forbids causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation to [a] child.

I don't know for certain which one of these should be filed: that's a problem for the Duterte's.

I am more interested in who's behind the Bikoy Videos.

Tiglao gives a lead
In his 22 April 2019 Manila Times column  Vile video vs Duterte the work of Otso Diretso, Trillanes writer and US-funded websites, Amb. Bobi Tiglao wrote:
cyber-crime experts found the Bikoy video to have been first uploaded to YouTube by a website www.metrobalita.net.
Metrobalita.net was taken down by its owner as soon as Tiglaos column came out.

Whats clear, however, is that Tiglao showed that the person/s behind the Bikoy Videos and the one/s behind MetroBalita are the same.

Tracing Google AdSense Publisher IDs
Tracing ownership of Google AdSense accounts, called a Reverse AdSense Lookup, is an effective way to unmask people, as was shown in the 29 September 2017 ThinkingPinoy article #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for. The article revealed the identity of the web administrator of SilentNoMorePH, the site that published libelous statements against several sitting senators.

The process is fairly simple:
1. Extract the unique Google AdSense Publisher ID of a given site.
2. Cross-reference to other websites that run online ads from the same Publisher ID.
3. Check who owns those other websites.

Step 1: extract ID from MetroBalita.net
Through an online third-party utility, Sasot was able to extract MetroBalita.Nets Publisher ID, which is:
ca-pub-9287075011637877
I did an independent verification using DNSlytics Reverse AdSense Lookup and the results corroborate Sasots findings, as shown below:



Step 2: Check for other sites using the same Google Publisher ID
Using the online third-party utility SpyOnWeb [A], I found that Google AdSense Publisher ID on MetroBalita.net is identical to the one used in MetroBalita.com, as shown below:


That is, whoever owns MetroBalita.Net and MetroBalita.Com must be the same person.

Step 3: Check for domain registry information
I did a quick WhoIs lookup on MetroBalita.net and MetroBalita.com. As expected, both use a domain privacy service so the site owners real name is undisclosed.

However, a deeper WhoIs history lookup using DomainTools shows that MetroBalita.coms owner publicly released his personal details when he initially registered MetroBalita.com in 14 May 2017, as shown in the following screenshot:

This is further corroborated by another online third-party tool Whoxy:


It is also worthy to note that MetroBalitas twitter account lists metrobalita.com as its official website:


Note that Metro Balita's twitter has been operating with metrobalita.net since the beginning of April 2019, as evidenced by a 21 April 2019 denial tweet:

Note that the same tweet is an admission that MetroBalita uploaded the Bikoy Videos, at least using the online assets that MetroBalita owns or controls.

Yes, all evidence points to a certain Rodel Jayme.

Who is Rodel Jayme?
A quick google search of Rodel Jayme leads us to the blog site jrodel0991.wordpress.com whose about page states that his twitter account is http://www.twitter.com/jrodel.

According to his Twitter Bio:
Rodel Jayme
@jrodel
Blogger, Gamer, License Amateur Radio Operator (DY1VDA) Discord: JRodel0991#1410 / Steam: jrodel / Twitch: jrodel0991
Judging from his tweets,  Jayme is a staunch Liberal Party supporter and a staunch Duterte critic.



Judging from his tweets, Jayme is a staunch LP supporter, as he has attended several Liberal Party events in the past.

A 28 June 2017 tweet shows he was attended Vice-president Leni Robredos #IstoryaNgPagAsa social media launch in 28 Jun 2017. An 02 July 2016 tweet shows hes also a member of the Liberal Party-aligned Democratic Warriors FB Group.


Aside from these, I also archived his tweets featuring other Liberal Party Personalities including one with Aquino Education Sec. Armin Luistro, another with Aquino Social Welfare Sec. Dinky Soliman, and another with Aquino Transportation Secretary Jun Abaya.

In another tweet, he also actively campaigned for Mar Roxas during the latters failed 2016 presidential bid:


Interestingly, another tweet suggests that Jayme is also acquainted with a certain Erlo Bornales of Mamamayang Alyansang Reporma (MAR):


MAR was featured in the 08 March 2016 ThinkingPinoy article Roxas has his own Internet Army?. In that article, it was shown that the group has been training its members as part of an online social media army:


Jayme, through Metro Balita, has been actively campaigning for VP Leni Robredo legal counsel and Liberal Party senatorial bet Romulo Macalintal. It's funny that Metro Balita tweets mostly about relatively unremarkable Macalintal, suggesting that there may be a link between the two.
Flight as a sign of guilt
Based on publicly available and independently verifiable online data, its clear that Rodel Jayme owns MetroBalita.net.

If juxtaposed to Tiglaos findings, then Rodel Jayme must have uploaded the Bikoy videos to YouTube, though its still unclear to me how the said cybercrime experts managed to link MetroBalita with the Ang Totoong Narco List youtube account.

In People v Tecson (G.R. No. 194234):
Jurisprudence has repeatedly declared that flight is an indication of guilt. The flight of an accused, in the absence of a credible explanation, would be a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be established for a truly innocent person would normally grasp the first available opportunity to defend himself and to assert his innocence.
Well, it appears that Jayme is actively deleting posts related to the Bikoy Videos. He has taken down the MetroBalita website (both .com and .net), Metrobalitas facebook video uploads, and other related posts.

Jayme may not be running away from authorities right now, but he sure did allow the evidence to fly away first",RJ Nieto,"April 26, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/04/heres-complete-step-by-step-guide-to.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
MARIA RESSAS CYBER LIBEL: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CONVICTION IS HIGHLY LIKELY,"I earlier wondered why Maria Ressa and her media allies never mentioned anything about the truthfulness of the report upon which Wilfredo Keng's libel suit was based.

I got the answer a day later, when I got hold of a letter [PDEA] dated 15 August 2016 from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, addressed to what I presume to be Keng's lawyer. The letter stated that Keng, at least as of the letter's writing, had NO DEROGATORY RECORD in PDEA's database.

Rappler never took down the assailed news article, despite knowing full well that all it has is merely an intelligence report while Keng has an official document proving the contrary.

Rappler, in short, published a VERIFIABLE FALSEHOOD.

MAINSTREAM MEDIA DEFENDING FAKE NEWS
Infallibility in reporting is impossible, but when faced with more reliable controverting information post-publication, responsible journalists are supposed to issue errata. The insistence of a publisher on the initial claim, despite more convincing evidence to the contrary, is what can be considered to be FAKE NEWS.

In short, all media men defending Maria Ressa vis-a-vis this libel case are essentially defending not the Right to Free Speech, but the non-existent Right to Publish Verifiably False Information.

I find this utterly hypocritical, as these are the same media men who have been decrying the supposed proliferation of Fake News, as they defend Maria Ressa as she lies through her teeth.

If an article verifiably misinforms, what exactly is the point of defending it in the Court of Public Opinion? Have the members of mainstream media started to look up to Joseph Goebbels?

Philippine Star columnist Carmen Pedrosa hit the nail on the head when she said:
Maria Ressa's story is not about about ""Freedom of the Press"" but her Freedom to Lie.
And Ressas mainstream media sympathizers are part of that fight.

DEFENSE BASED ON TECHNICALITIES
Ressa, through various media outlets, raised three defenses:

FIRST, that the act was committed in early 2012, i.e. prior to the cyber libel laws enactment in late 2012, thereby allowing Ressa to enjoy constitutional protection against ex post facto laws.

However, as the Justice Department correctly pointed out in its resolution on Keng v Ressa [DoJ], that the 2014 update of the Keng-Corona article makes the case fall under the Multiple Publication rule, where each and every publication of the same libel constitutes a distinct offense.

SECOND, that there was a Temporary Restraining Order on the Cyber Libel Law when the article was updated in 2014, so that the Cyber Libel Law cannot be invoked.

The Supreme Court indeed issued a TRO pending a decision on the constitutionality of several provisions, including Cyber Libel, of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 [GMANews].

Unfortunately for Ressa, The TRO was lifted on 11 February 2014 when the High Court ruled on Disini v Secretary of Justice [G.R. No. 203335], while the Rappler updated the Keng-Corona article 19 February 2014.

Rappler committed the act EIGHT DAYS after the Cyber Libel Law became fully active.

THIRD, that the prescriptive period for filing a case has lapsed. Ressa argues that Keng cant sue her anymore because libel can be filed only up to a year after Keng found out about it.

Acts punishable under the Revised Penal Code, which includes libel, have a prescriptive period of one year as explained in People v Gines [G.R. No. 83463].

Some camps argue, however, that Cyber Libel is covered under a special law (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012), so that the prescriptive period, given that the its punishable by a minimum of 4 years imprisonment, should be eight years per CA 3326, which states [ChanRobles]:
Violations penalized by special acts shall prescribe after eight years for those punished by imprisonment for two years or more...
However, other camps argue that RA 4661 trumps CA 3326 as it states:
""The crime of libel or other similar offenses shall prescribe in one year.
The one-year prescription period theory is problematic.
RA 4661 Sec. 1 clearly states that it amends only Article 90 of the Revised Penal Code.

RA 4661 says nothing about prescriptive period of criminal complaints arising from special laws, and the case filed against Ressa is based on the Cybercrime Prevention Act, a special law.


Moreover, Keng filed the complaint in 2012 or shortly after the initial publication of the Rappler article, or well within a year after the discovery of the libelous statement.

So no, a defense based on prescriptive period likely wont hold water.

Moreover, state prosecutors can even explore the Search Engine Optimization angle.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of maximizing the number of visitors to a particular website by ensuring that the site appears high on the list of results returned by a search engine like Google.
Whenever Rappler engages in SEO, it promotes ALL CONTENTS of the Rappler website, including the Keng-Corona article. That is, Ressa reiterates the defamatory statement everytime her company does SEO.
And how often does Rappler do SEO? ALL THE TIME.
Defenses relying on prescriptive periods and ex post facto laws should not hold by virtue of the multiple publication rule and Rapplers continual SEO practices.

Now that weve gotten the technicalities out of the way, its time to discuss the merits of the case, i.e. whether all the elements constituting online libel are present in Kengs complaint.


LIBEL CONVICTIONS AND MARIAS LEGAL DEFENSE
TRUTH IS NOT A DEFENSE in libel cases with private complainants such as the one Keng filed against Ressa et Al. However, the point in my wonderment over Ressas reluctance to use truth as a defense is my curiosity as to what defenses Ressas legal team will employ.

But before I elaborate on that, let me first explain how a libel conviction can be had.


Like any other criminal case, the prosecution must convince the court of the presence of the elements of the crime of libel.

Here are the elements of libel [BatasNatin]:
 The defamatory imputation which, in this case, is tagging Keng as a drug smuggler and human trafficker, as it clearly lowers the respect in which Keng is regarded. 
 The publication of libelous matter which, in this case, is the 2014 update of the Keng-Corona article. Ressa argues that the article was published in 2012 before the Cyber Libel Law. The article's 2014 update, as the Justice Department correctly argues, was done AFTER the law's enactment.
 The complainant was identified and he sure was, as the article clearly stated the name Wilfredo Keng.
 There must be malice, as is the case. Citing Ateneos Dean Tony La Via in his 2014 [Manila Standard] column, Philippine libel law creates the presumption that malice is present in every defamatory imputation.
Since Ressas is a cyber libel case, then a fifth element is required:
 Online publication, and this is pretty obvious, with Rappler being an online-only media organization.
The first three elements, along with the fifth, are hardly contestable, and any defense counsel worth his salt will focus his energies in debunking the supposed presence of the fourth element: malice.


More specifically, Ressa must show, for starters, that the Presumption of Malice does not hold in this case.

OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF MALICE
I am a long-time political blogger, a radio commentator, a newspaper columnist and a subject of a pending and relatively high-profile libel case filed by Antonio Trillanes, a sitting senator of the Philippines. I have carefully studied and took to heart libel laws not only because I find them interesting, but because I have to, for my own good.

After all, as the veteran journalist Ninez Cacho-Olivares in her 15 February 2019 [Daily Tribune] column aptly puts, journalists should know that libel is part of the territory.

By the way, Cacho-Olivares has successfully defended herself against at least two libel cases: one filed by former Ilocos Sur Governor Chavit Singson in 2001, and another by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyos then personal lawyer Pancho Villaraza in 2002.

Going back to topic and after consulting several lawyer-friends, four out of the five elements of libel (imputation, publication, identification, and online nature) are hardly disputable, so that her legal team should focus on debunking the last one, which is Presumption of Malice, as described in Yuchengco v Manila Chronicle [G.R. No. 184315]:
There is a presumption of malice in the case of every defamatory imputation, where there is no showing of a good intention or justifiable motive for making such imputation.
Most journalists debunk this presumption via the oft-used Public Figure Doctrine, part of which was expounded in the landmark Guingging v CA [G.R. No. 128959], which states:
If the statements made against the public figure are essentially true, then no conviction for libel can be had.
That is, Ressa must show that Keng:
 is a public figure, and  
 that the drug trafficker claim is essentially true.

ESSENTIAL TRUTHFULNESS OF INTELLIGENCE REPORTS
Unfortunately for Ressa and as shown in previous sections, Rapplers demonstrably reckless disregard for the veracity of the Keng-Corona article prevents Ressa from taking refuge in this doctrine.

Keng is a private businessman so he may not be considered a public figure at first glance. However, with a few legal acrobatic maneuvers, Ressas legal team may argue that he is a limited-purpose public figure, in light of the Rappler Keng-Corona articles claim that Keng granted then Chief Justice Corona favors.

Supposing that Keng is a public figure for the sake of argument, Ressa then needs to show that its essentially true that Keng is a drug trafficker.

Lets go back to the basics by quoting Rapplers Keng-Corona article:
we got hold of an intelligence report that detailed Keng's past. Prepared in 2002 The report stated that Keng had been under surveillance by the National Security Council for alleged involvement in human trafficking and drug smuggling.
In fairness to Ressa, the drug trafficker tag in Keng-Corona article in 2012 is essentially true as Rappler cited intelligence reports apparently sourced from the National Security Council. The problem, however, is that intelligence reports do not bear the same weight as official documents from law enforcement agencies.

Borrowing the Prussian war general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz words:
Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain. In short, most intelligence is false.[George and Kline 2006]
While intelligence reports are highly fallible, it can still be argued that, in the absence of weightier evidence to the contrary and considering that the Corona Impeachment Trial is a Public Interest issue, information cited from such documents are essentially true.

In short, if Keng sued Ressa for the 2012 article and that article alone, an acquittal is not unlikely.

But Ressa isnt out of the woods just yet.

MARIA RESSA'S RECKLESS DISREGARD FOR TRUTH OR FALSITY
Aside from the Rapplers source being an intelligence report, the claim becomes even more problematic as Rappler did not even cite who prepared it. While Rappler mentioned the National Security Council, it didnt say it was from the same agency. After all, an intelligence report can be based upon another intelligence report.

Regardless, with the assumption that Keng is a public figure, Ressa can argue that the 2012 Rappler article forwarded an essentially truthful claim, so that no libel conviction can be had in as far as the 2012 article is concerned.

In libel cases involving public figures, the complainant has must prove that Actual Malice is present, as explained in Borjal v CA [G.R. No. 126466]:
The guarantees of freedom of speech and press prohibit a public figure from recovering damages unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.
That is, complainant Keng must prove that there was Actual Malice. That is, he must be able to convince the court that Ressa demonstrated a reckless disregard of whether the drug trafficker claim was false or not.

And heres where it gets SUPER interesting.

PUBLIC FIGURES AND ACTUAL MALICE
The series of events that followed the articles 2012 publication suggest that there indeed was Actual Malice on Ressas part.

In a 14 Feb 2019 official statement, Keng said [MindaNews]:

I tried to communicate with Rappler in order to have the said article taken down, clear my name and restore my reputation
Keng added:
In turn, Rappler repeatedly promised me that they will take down the subject article, but never did. The libelous attacks remain posted on their website until now.
Assuming that Keng can provide evidence (emails, SMS messages or whatnot) that Rappler indeed promised to take down the article, then Rapplers continual failure to take the article down (its still up as I write this piece) screams Actual Malice.

Moreover, the 2016 PDEA letter reinforces Kengs case as it stated:
Record check shows Keng has no derogatory record on file.
It has been over two years since that letters writing, and it would safe to assume that Keng has notified Rappler about it.

The 2016 PDEA Letter 
Despite all of these, the Rappler's Keng-Corona article is still up.

This bears repeating:
Even with the assumption that Ressa published the 2012 article in good faith, subsequent events showed that Ressa insisted on keeping the article online and for everyone to see even after having been provided weightier controverting evidence, and even after her organization itself acknowledged the gross inaccuracy of the report when it promised Keng to take the article down.
Ressa showed reckless disregard of whether the drug trafficker claim was false or not.

Actual Malice is present.

Ressa even hurt her prospects for acquittal when she went on a global media blitz after DOJ served the arrest warrant, as her recent actions just point towards the fact that Ressa doesn't care if she's publishing what is VERIFIABLY FAKE NEWS.

Ressas insistence on publishing defamatory statements with reckless disregard for their truthfulness, making a conviction for Cyber Libel highly likely. Hence, it appears that Ressa may be the first person in Philippine History to be convicted for such an offense.

As far as I can see, Ressa will go to jail.",RJ Nieto,"February 16, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/02/maria-ressa-cyber-libel-how-solve.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Parents: DOH bangkay chasers buy evidence from Dengvaxia victims,"A child holding a Dengvaxia Card.
Its been over a year since the Dengvaxia Scandal erupted in November 2017. Since then, the Public Attorneys Office (PAO) with its chief Atty. Persida Acosta has autopsied the bodies of over a hundred vaccinees, a vast majority of whom are school-age children who received the vaccine through the botched 2016 school-based vaccination program of the Department of Health (DOH), led by then Secretary Janette Garin.

PAO has already filed a number of criminal, civil, and administrative cases against the perpetrators of what could possibly be the biggest case of medical practice in Modern History.

Justice, however, remains elusive, as several of the victims parents came forward and accused todays Department of Health of attempting to buy evidence from them, which would make it more difficult for the victims families to secure convictions against the culprits.


Todays Health Department is headed by Secretary Francisco Duque, who previously was a DOH consultant reporting directly to Noynoy Aquino-era DOH Sec. Janette Garin.

The Basics of Filing a Dengvaxia Case
President Rodrigo Duterte tasked the Public Attorneys Office was tasked by to handle Dengvaxia cases of any affected family who requests for assistance.

To initiate a formal complaint, PAO logically asks every complainant to submit medical records that shall be used as supporting evidence, including:

1. Dengvaxia Card  A small card issued by the DOH at the time of vaccination, detailing the who was vaccinated, where the vaccination took place, and when the recipient received Dengvaxia doses. This serves as prima facie evidence that the child indeed received Dengvaxia.
2. Death Certificate  This document states the date and cause of death.

3. Medical Abstract  A concise summary of the Dengvaxia recipients condition, usually issued by a qualified medical professional around the time of the recipients death.
Without these basic documents, winning a Dengvaxia case will be severely prolonged, if not impossible.

But theres a problem.

Several Dengvaxia parents recently told PAO that the Department of Health has been attempting to get their original records in exchange for Php 50,0000 medical assistance. While its true that President Duterte instructed DOH to extend financial assistance, the President DID NOT order DOH to take away evidence from the victims kin.

But thats what DOH did.

Umattend ako ng conference tungkol sa Dengvaxia victims noong Setyembre 2018 sa DOH at doon ko napag-alaman na may Php 50,000 silang ibibigay basta kumpletuhin lang ang mga requirements [tulad ng] certification na na-inject ng Dengvaxia Vaccine (Dengvaxia Card).
TRANSLATION: I attended a conference about Dengvaxia victims in September 2018 at the DOH and I learned from there that they have Php 50,000 to give out as soon as we complete the requirements like the certification that our child was injected with Dengvaxia.

DOH's efforts? Not only at the grassroots
The statements quoted in the previous section detail the Health Departments attempts at the grassroots level to sabotage the cases of Dengvaxia victims. To add insult to injury, DOH used President Dutertes own name to steal evidence away from the victims, even if helping the victims is the only thing President Duterte said.

In November 2018, the Public Attorneys Office wrote to DOH Region 7, asking the latter for the Dengvaxia Card, death certificate, and other original documents that the latter received from a Cebu City complainant.


In response, DOH Region 7 Director Jaime Bernadas said he cant provide the documents because they have already been sent to DOH Central in Manila,  as shown in the letter below:

In short, Dengvaxia victims who availed of the P50,000 assistance will find it even harder to file a case, let alone secure a conviction, because DOH is holding their evidence hostage in exchange for a measly sum of Php 50,000.

But the DOHs efforts do not end there. Several top-ranking government officials and even a very prominent Dengvaxia advocate have been attempting to persuade PAO Chief Acosta to exonerate DOH Sec. Duque.


This is despite their knowledge that such a proposal, aside from being a a ground for disbarment of PAO lawyers, is a shameless betrayal to the Dengvaxia victims who want nothing but justice for their dead children.

Fortunately, PAO has consistently and vehemently objected to these advances.

"FACT CHECK: How exactly did Mar Roxas become ""Mar Roxas Ekonomista""?","Losing 2016 presidential contender and 2019 senatorial aspirant Manuel ""Mar"" Roxas II recently launched an advertisement campaign ""Mar Roxas Ekonomista"", a clear attempt at branding Roxas as an economist... but is he?



Set in a barber shop, the ad started with various actors asking questions about inflation, taxes, salary deductions, subsidies, transport costs, etc, until the barber interjected with:

""Ekonomista! Ekonomista ang kailangan. Si Mar Roxas, 'yun! Maraming ekonomista diyan pero para sa amin, si Mar, aming ekonomista!
(TRANSLATION: ""Economist. We need an economist. Mar Roxas... that guy! There are many economists out there but for us, our economist is Mar!)


Hence, let's ask...

How much of an economist is ""Mar Ekonomista""?
I visited his official website, MarRoxas.com. I then navigated to his ""about page"" and saw this:


The description alongside his graduation photo reads:
1964 - 1979 
Background in Economics 
Mar graduated from Ateneo de Manila University in 1974 and the Wharton School of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979
Let's dissect this claim.
Born on 13 May 1957, Roxas was just 7 years old in 1964, 17 years old in 1974, and just 22 years old in 1979. 

In short, Mar counted his ""Background in Economics"" starting at First Grade. Yes, Mar counted his ""Background in Economics"" from age 7 to age 22.

I don't know about you, but elementary and high school doesn't count as a background in Economics: That's called basic education. 

This smells too much like resume padding to me.

Anyway, as for his undergraduate Wharton economics degree...

What is an Economist? 
But he has an undergrad economics degree, right?

I checked several websites to check the educational requirements for Economists.

According to CollegeGrad.com:
""A master's degree or Ph.D. is required for most economist jobs.""
According to YourFreeCareerTest:
An economist usually needs a masters degree or Ph.D., but in the case of entry-level jobs, such as in government, a bachelors degree is acceptable.
According to MyMajors.com:
""Doctoral Degree usually needed for this career""
Given this, I think it is safe to say that Economists are expected to have at least a master's degree, although entry-level economist jobs may not require it.

Unfortunately, Roxas received no postgraduate education at all, so Roxas is an entry-level economist at best. Surely, any self-respecting senatorial candidate will never boast about being an entry-level economist, right?

Well, not for Mar.

But let's give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, formal education isn't everything, so let's check his employment history for more information.

Mar the Investment Banker
After leaving college and before entering politics, Mar worked as investment banker at Allen & Company on Wall Street, and Mar himself bragged about it in his own website when he said he ""rose through the ranks to become an Assistant Vice-president (AVP).

A screenshot of Roxas's website taken on 20 Jan 2019.

Note that Allen & Co. is a boutique investment bank, with boutique being a fancy term for small.

While it can be argued that Allen & Co. of today is a big-time investment bank, we are more concerned about its status when Mar was still working for them. That is, what Allen & Co. was like in the 1980s.

In a 2004 article, Fortune.com described Allen & Co. Company with:
Allen & Co. has no research department and has never had a New York Stock Exchange membership. Statistically, the firm is insignificant; Securities Data rankings show, for example, that in mergers and acquisitions, Allen has not ranked higher than 11th among all securities firms in any of the past 15 years.
The same article states that Allen and Company's as of 2004 had a total 175 employees, paling in comparison to Barclay's 20,500 employees, or Goldman Sach's 34,000. Moreover, if it had only that many at that time, it must have had a lot fewer in 1980s when Mar was over there.

More important, however, is the part where Forbes said Allen & Co. has no research department, implying that Mar Roxas didn't really do significant economic research work during his stint at the firm.

And to top it all off, it appears that Roxas' performance as an investment banker wasn't even stellar at all.

Let me tell you how exactly.


Promoted only once in 14 years
In the world of investment banking, the title of Assistant Vice-president (AVP) is essentially meaningless. An AVP, also known as an Associate Vice-president, is a classic example of job-title inflation.

In Aleynikov vs Goldman Sachs, the United States Court of Appeals said:
""...title inflation in the financial services industry is prevalent and the title of vice president is not particularly meaningful."" 
No less than Mar Roxas' own Wharton School's Knowledge Base states:
""...[I]n the investment banking and brokerage industries, just about everyone is a vice president, including 'the guys opening the door and serving you coffee.'""
Note that the US Court of Appeals and Mar Roxas' own alma mater were belittling the job title ""vice-president"".


Mar Roxas, on the other hand, is an ""assistant vice-president"", putting him AT LEAST ONE LEVEL BELOW the already meaningless ""vice-president"".

To make it worse, it appears that he got promoted ONLY ONCE during his 14-year stint at Allen & Co:


According to Investopedia, the standard investment banking career order includes:
Investment Banking Analyst
Investment Banking Associate
Vice President
Senior Vice President
Managing Director
In short, Mar's job title belongs somewhere between ""Associate"" and ""Assistant Vice-president"".

However, after checking the job portal GlassDoor, it appears that the titles are synonymous because they are listed under the same salary grade.

A screenshot of GlassDoor showing that top banks consider the title ""AVP"" and ""Associate"" are interchangeable and are both under the same salary bracket.
In short, Mar Roxas lasted for FOURTEEN YEARS in Allen & Co. but he got PROMOTED ONLY ONCE.

I do not have sky-high standards for senators, but if Mar wants to claim to be an economist, he should be able to demonstrate it.


It's bad enough that Mar Roxas has no postgraduate education that's expected in most economist just jobs, but adding the fact that his professional economics background is nothing but a woefully mediocre stint in a small investment bank that doesn't even do research makes it much, much worse.

Benefit of the doubt
But anyone can argue that formal education and job promotions aren't the end-all and be-all of brilliance, so let's check the projects that he was involved in.

The about page of Roxas' old website states [Archived Copy]:
[Mar Roxas] proposed to his company to set up shop in Asia, specifically in the Philippines, and later his superiors agreed. In 1991, he was stationed in the country under North Star Capitals, Inc. which took Jollibee public. In the United States, he participated in the first financing of Discovery Channel and Tri-Star Pictures.
Lets analyze the paragraph more carefully because I am taking these statements with a grain of salt, especially since Mar has a penchant for vague wording.

First, the writeup did not provide any specifics about his roles NorthStar Capitals, Inc (NCI). While Mar used the words proposed, stationed, and participated, he never used high-impact words such as directed, led, or envisioned.

For example, any new hire can propose something, any security guard can be stationed to another place, and any maintenance crew member can ""participate"" in a company's operations.

But then, Mar would probably say, My tasks were more complex than just that.

But given his predilection for resume-padding as shown in the previous sections, wouldn't it be odd if Roxas willfully declined to brag about the complexity of his roles?

Until Mar mentions a specific, concrete, and management-related achievement during his Allen and Company AVP stint, that AVP title will mean nothing.

And no, that investment banking stint doesn't make him an economist.

But how about during his political career?

Well, if one can be economist by being a long-time politician, then pretty much every politician over the age of 50 is an economist.

To cut the long story short, Mar is not an economist.

But then, he may still be an economist... according to that barber.",RJ Nieto,"January 20, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/01/fact-check-mar-roxas-ekonomista.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
What DFA data breach? A 2nd open letter to the incompetent and egotistic Twitter Boy Locsin,"Teddy Boy, how does it feel to swallow your own vomit?


Days ago, DFA Sec. Teddy Boy Locsin said there was a data breach in DFA's passporting system after passport printer Oberthur supposedly ran away with the personal information of Filipino passport holders. To further exacerbate the situation, Locsin also said we can't really go after Oberthur because it was pretty much the government's fault why it happened.

A nationwide stir ensued, especially since it seemed that the government learned nothing from the 2016 COMELEC data leak, where hackers released the nation's entire voter database for anyone to see.

After the public found out that Oberthur's contract ended in 2015, i.e. under the Noynoy AquinoAdministration, Locsin was quick to exonerate then Foreign Sec. Albert del Rosario and pinned the blame on Duterte's former Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano.

Locsin, in an eerily Yellow Fashion, was so quick at blaming people even if he didn't even understand what exactly happened. He, at the time, didn't even understand what exactly he's blaming people for.


KNOWLEDGEABLE GOV'T OFFICIALS REBUT THE CLUELESS LOCSIN'S CLAIMS
Clarifications from other government officials who are more familiar with the passport issue showed that there was NO DATA LEAK. Old passport data was simply stored in obsolete hardware, making it unreadable by DFA's new passport printer APO Production Unit, Inc., which uses more modern equipment.

Social Media lambasted Locsin for his utterly irresponsible and ill-informed tweets. Locsin, instead of listening to valid criticism, even went as far as accusing Rody Duterte supporters of being of a ""social media campaign"" that ""crosses partisan lines"".

Locsin eventually admitted that there was no leak. But instead of totally owning up to the consequences of his verbal diarrhea, he alleged a supposed coverup of the passport mess, without specifying which parties are involved in the coverup. This led many to believe that even Duterte's own men may have something to do with it.

But it isn't the case either. It's simply an issue of a former contractor who doesn't want to spend more money to make it easier for the replacement contractor to do its job.

There was no data leak. Instead, it's just an issue of an asshole being an asshole to assholes. 

TEDDY BOY TRIES TO SAVE HIS OWN ASS FROM HUMILIATION
Not yet content of his already schizophrenic version of the passport problem, Locsin also said that the old contractor made the data ""inaccessible"", which is also incorrect. Again, new technology can't read the Oberthur's old technology. The problem is not sabotage, but simply obsoletion.

But that more accurate version of the story wouldn't be dramatic enough for Locsin, I guess.

Here's the thing, Sec. Locsin:
Spend less time trying to be a Twitter superstar (which you aren't) defending Kris Aquino and more time actually doing your job... and that job includes FULLY KNOWING issues within your department BEFORE YOU START RUNNING YOUR MOUTH.
Had you done that from the onset, you would not have had to weave fake news upon fake news in your desperate attempt at avoiding humiliation.


Is this what Pres. Duterte appointed you for? 

I actually encourage top level government officials to talk about what's going on in their respective agencies, but that is with the understanding that they actually know what they are talking about.

Unfortunately, you DO NOT KNOW what you're talking about. And when it came it a point where you had to fact check your own messed up story, you again ordered your Little Secretary to do your own work.

INCOMPETENT AND EGOTISTIC
Your recent order removing birth certificates as a requirement for e-passport renewals? That's useless because BC's have ceased to become a requirement for such renewals no later than in 2014.

That's just like taking credit for passing a law that already exists in the first place.

Sec. Locsin, you can even claim all day that we are just ""fucking envious"" of your own success, work ethic, looks, pedigree and wealth, but I surely will never be envious of your bloated ego that's getting in the way of Public Interest.

Remember that I support Duterte, but supporting Duterte does not mean supporting someone as incompetent and as egotistic as you.

You have always given us the impression that you are so convinced that you are so much better than most of us... AND I BELIEVE IT'S NOW THE RIGHT TIME FOR YOU TO LOOK THE PART.",RJ Nieto,"January 15, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/01/what-dfa-data-breach-2nd-open-letter-to.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Wait, What!?! Kris Aquino vs Nicko Falcis Saga links to PNOY and the South China Sea Conflict","The latest installment of the Kris Aquino vs Nicko Falcis saga reveals PNoy's close relationship with the Indonesian billionaire whose greed brought the Philippines to the brink of war with China.

The conflict between actress Kris Aquino and her estranged manager Nicko Falcis was supposed to be purely personal, until we got the shock of our lives as their exchanges revealed national interest implications, such as when we found out that the showbiz cockroach Aquino was funding opposition-aligned political black propagandists such as Pinoy Ako Blog's Jover Laurio.


Thinking Pinoy certainly thought that that was the end of it, until a recent ABS-CBN article about the Aquino-Falcis tiff resurrected a story bigger than both parties combined.

When PNOY asked Salim for a very special favor
In the 14 January 2019 ABS-CBN article ""Nicko Falcis: 'I was so devastated. I thought I was in a Shake, Rattle & Roll chapter. [Archived]', it was reported that Kris Aquino, after suffering a severe allergic reaction during one of her promo shoots in Indonesia, was whisked away to Manila for immediate medical treatment with help from her siblings.

Falcis said:
""...[Kris Aquino] sought the help of her siblings in Metro Manila so that she could return to the Philippines and receive proper medical attention. I was told that her brother, former President B. C. Aquino, contacted his Indonesian friend, a certain Mr. Salim, who... graciously allowed the use of his private plane for Aquinos emergency flight.""  
Kris Aquino (L) and Nicko Falcis (R), during better times
That is, Falcis, wittingly or unwittingly, revealed that former President Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino (PNOY) has a close relationship with ""a certain Mr. Salim"", close enough for the latter to graciously lend a plane to PNoy at a moment's notice.

And here's the problem: that ""certain Mr. Salim"" is most likely the guy whose greed brought us to the brink of war with China in the South China Sea.


Yes, I am talking about Indonesia's 4th-richest billionaire Anthoni Salim, head of mammoth firm First Pacific, whose directors include Aquino-era Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario and Metro Pacific CEO Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP).

So what about it?

Well, documents show that Salim's First Pacific, through directors Del Rosario and MVP, has been interested in Reed Bank in the Spratly Island Group way before the Aquino-era chapter of the South China Sea began, and they will do all they can  including betraying the Filipino People  just to get it. 

And with the revelation in the 2019 ABS-CBN Kris-Nicko article , it appears that PNoy was in on it, and not just the three.

Salim, del Rosario, and Manny Pangilinan
Albert del Rosario was the Philippine Ambassador to the United States from 2001 to 2006. He joined First Pacific as an independent non-executive director while still an ambassadorin in June 2003. He then served as a non-executive director starting 2004. 

PNOY made Del Rosario his Foreign Affairs Secretary while the latter was still with First Pacific. Del Rosario resigned from the Salim-owned firm a month later, only to rejoin First Pacifics board in June 2016 [FP].


(Featured Image, L to R: First Pacific Director and Aquino-era Foreign Sec. Albert del Rosario, First Pacific Chairman Anthoni Salim, and First Pacific CEO Manny V. Pangilinan)
In the 2016 article The South China Sea Decision and Perfecto Yasays Face, ThinkingPinoy explained how the South China Sea enjoyed an uneasy peace until Foreign Secretary del Rosario in March 2011 allowed Salim-MVPs Forum Energy to start looking for hydrocarbons beneath Reed Bank in the South China Sea.

Meanwhile, in another 2016 On Sec. Albert del Rosario, is there anybody worse than Karen Davila, ThinkingPinoy explained how del Rosario, throughout his term as Foreign Affairs chief, made decisions that favored Salim-MVPs hydrocarbon interests in the South China Sea, in violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and the Code of Conduct for Public Officials.


Del Rosario, Salim, and Manny V. Pangilinan (MVP) belong to the top management of First Pacific, the parent company of the Salim-MVP Group, which includes Philex Petroleum and Forum Energy [FP].

That is, Salim owns Forum Energy, the same company that had one of the largest parts in igniting tension between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea.

ThinkingPinoy dug deeper into the issue by examining Forum Energys situation prior to the March 2011 Reed Bank Incident. After all a foreign relations debacle of this magnitude should be rooted on something that has been going on for years, and going on for years it actually did.

That is, after I did a little more digging, I discovered documents showing that Del Rosario-Salim-MVPs First Pacific has been interested in Reed Bank way before 2011.

1: Why the sudden interest in Reed Bank?
Another firm called Sterling Energy first explored Reed Bank in the 1970s and found natural gas. The 1970s 2D Explorationfocused on oil because gas was considered non-commercial at that time.

An exploration well was drilled on South Reed Bank in four different years: 1976, 1978, 1982, and 1984. The 1976 and 1984 exploratory wells (Sampaguita-1 and -3A) yielded natural gas but results are inconclusive [US SEC].

The Sampaguita Gas Discovery is inside Reed Bank, one of the contested areas in the South China Sea.

Nothing happened in Reed Bank for the next two decades, mainly because this area (called the Sampaguita Gas Discovery), aside from being generally non-commercial, was too remote for the technology of those times.

But two things happened afterwards[OGJ]:
 natural gas technology advanced throughout the years, making it commercially viable, and, 
 the exploitation of nearby Malampaya Gas Field in 2001 resulted to the construction of a gas pipeline from Palawan to Batangas.
That is, Sampaguitas would-be operators can just piggyback on the existing Malampaya pipeline, allowing it to drastically cut down on costs, as I quote [OGJ]:
""While (Sampaguita) was always of note to many explorationists, it was of little commercial value in earlier years. No one was particularly interested in a stranded gas deposit in the South China Sea 500 miles southwest of Manila. This has changed dramatically with the presence of a major gas pipeline to Luzon whose origin point at Malampaya field is only about 100 miles to the northeast.
In short, everyone knew there was gas in Reed Bank, but gas wasnt a big thing until recently. Coupled with Reed Banks proximity to the 2001 Malampaya Pipeline, the once-ignored area suddenly showed lots of promise.

With these two developments, Sampaguita suddenly became a hot item.

2: Salim-MVP gets Reed Bank
Salim-MVPs interest in Reed Bank rose in 2005, a year after del Rosario changed his job description from independent non-executive director of First Pacific to non-executive director of the same company.

In 2005, independent firm PGS said the Sampaguita Gas Discovery can rival the size of the Malampaya Gas Field. PGS, however, noted that the application of modern technology is required to confirm the size, productibility and commerciality of this discovery, as available data was over 20 years old [US SEC].

In short, Sampaguita has to be explored again to confirm natural gas deposits.

PGSs 2005 statement was issued in response to Sterling Energys plan to sell 100% of its stake in Reed Bank to newly-incorporated UK-based Forum Energy. Forum Energy is majority-owned by Del-Rosario-Salim-MVPs First Pacific through its subsidiary Philex Petroleum [TP: Philex].

Forum Energy officially acquired the Reed Bank Contract, called GSEC 101, on 18 May 2005 [US SEC].

On 19 August 2005, Forum Energy announced the completion of its 3D Seismic Survey over the Sampaguita Gas Discovery [FEC]. A year later, the company said the Sampaguita Gas Discovery is a world class asset after confirming a minimum of 3 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas reserves. It plans to conduct more tests on the sands in Reed Bank to potentially double this figure [FEC].

At this point, Salim-MVPs rights over Reed Bank were granted by the Department of Energys (DoE) Geophysical Survey and Exploration Contract (GSEC) 101. This GSEC had to be converted into a Service Contract (SC) to add the right to commercially extract gas.The DoE notified Forum Energy that the formal signing of the Service Contract (SC 72) was to be held on August 2008 [FEC]. DoE eventually issued SC 72 in February 2010 [FEC].

2008 was also the year when Philex Petroleum further increased its stake in the Sampaguita Gas Field by buying shares from Canadian FEC Resources, one of the Reed Banks stakeholders [FEC].

This enabled Salim to gain a controlling 51% ownership of FEC. Consequently, Philex Mining Chief Operating Officer (COO) Jose Ernesto Villaluna, Jr. [Bloomberg] was named President and CEO of FEC [FEC].

Salim's Forum Energy conducted and completed the controversial Reed seismic survey in March 2011 [FEC], triggering a chain of events that led to the UNCLOS arbitration case [TP: Yasays Face].

3: Too much info? Heres A Quick Recap
Its time to recap what has been discussed so far.

Reed Bank was first explored  during the Marcos Era and gas was indeed found. At that time, however, technological constraints made gas unprofitable, so the Marcos-Era surveys focused instead on finding crude oil.

Nobody cared about Reed Bank until natural gas has finally become useful two decades later. Adding the construction of pipelines for Palawans Malampaya Gas Field in 2001, Reed Bank suddenly became a very attractive asset.

The Salim-MVP group started to move in 2005 as it acquired Reed Bank exploration rights. The group successfully conducted Reed Bank seismic surveys on the same year but it will take another year to interpret the data.

The 2005 seismic survey returned very encouraging results in 2006, and Salim-MVP requested the DoE to allow it to extract gas from Reed Bank. DoE issued the permit, called SC 72, in 2008.

During that same period, the Salim-MVP group increased its stake on Reed Bank by buying shares from other stakeholders, finally enabling it to have a controlling stake on the Reed Bank contract by the time it was issued in February 2010. This was about four months before President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stepped down to be replaced by President Benigno Noynoy Aquino.

At first, I had a hunch that Salim may have contributed a significant portion of PNOY's 2010 presidential campaign funds so his company can benefit from a pro-Salim Aquino Government.

And the recently revealed close relationship between PNOY and Salim, as exhibited by the favor Salim extended to PNOY in 2018, does nothing but reinforce that suspicion.

But we're not done yet.

4: PH-China-Vietnam Joint Exploration
As mentioned in a previous section, Salim-MVP acquired rights over Reed Bank in May 2005. About a year before that, however, a three-nation agreement that directly affected Reed Bank was forged.

The respective governments of the Philippines, China, and Vietnam signed a deal to jointly explore the South China Sea for oil and natural gas. This was after China moved to ease South China Sea tensions by proposing the said venture [ASJ].

This was made possible through a joint undertaking of their respective state-owned oil companies Philippine National Oil Corporation (PNOC), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation (PetroVietnam). Called the Joint Marine Seismic Undertaking (JMSU), the project covers a well-defined area that includes Reed Bank [VCCI].

The three-year JMSU, with the option to extend, was signed on 01 September 2004 between Philippines and China [UPD]. Vietnam joined in March 2005 [VCCI].

According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under the agreement, the firms are committed to strictly adhering to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea [VCCI].

Again, its clear that the South China Sea issue has been in the works even before PNoy assumed office.

5: Pres. Noynoy Aquinos stance
The PGMA-era JMSU lapsed in July 2008 and was not extended. As to why, heres a good reason according to the Philippine Star:
The decision on whether to extend the JMSU is crucial especially for Forum Energy PLC, which is optimistic that it could bag one contract in the Sampaguita prospects in offshore Palawan once the tri-partite agreement expires The existence of the JMSU apparently affected the application for conversion of Forum Energy [Star] .
DoE eventually issued the SC 72 Reed Bank Contract to Salim-MVP in in February 2010 [FEC].

And the PNOY entered Malacaang several months later, bringing with him an uncannily antagonistic stance towards PGMA's JMSU.

In January 2011, Pres. Aquino said:
Yung isa sa mga diniscuss naming ngayon yung joint seismic study na nag-e-encroach din sa ating territorial waters but nag-lapse na. Pero that shouldn't have happened [ABS].
(One of the issues we discussed today was joint seismic study that encroaches our territorial waters. The contract may have lapsed but it shouldnt have happened in the first place.)
A month later in February 2011, Aquino appointed First Pacific Director Albert del Rosario as Foreign Affairs secretary. Two weeks after the appointment, del Rosario authorized the Salim-MVP company to conduct seismic surveys on Reed Bank, leading to a chain of events that culminated into the South China Sea arbitration case [TP: Yasays Face].

And those chain of events include a military confrontation in the South China Sea.

[GMA News] in March 2011 reported:
The Philippine military... sent an aircraft to the disputed Reed Bank near Palawan after receiving a report that Chinese patrol boats were trying to harass some Filipino oil explorers in the area.
The report was referring to Salim's Forum Energy, who was exploring Reed Bank at the time, in violation of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea [ASEAN], which states:
""The Parties undertake to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability...""
And what did the PH do? Violate the code in 2011 when it allowed oil exploration in a disputed area, the same code that the Philippines agreed to and signed.

China's reclamation in the South China Sea? It was, at least partly, in retaliation to PNOY's decision to allow Salim and Co. to violate the 2002 Code of Conduct by authorizing oil exploration in disputed territory.



6: Something doesnt add up
China tried to reach out to the Aquino Administration several times but it was constantly rebuffed by Foreign Affairs Secretary del Rosario, as he insisted that China should not take part in any exploration project. However, given what has been discussed in the previous sections, I believe the Philippine Government has (or had) two options:

OPTION A: PNOC-CNOOC-PetroVietnam
The Chinese and Vietnamese Governments arent stupid: they know the 60/40 PH law on foreign ownership. China and Vietnam would not have bothered to talk to us if they were unwilling to acknowledge that, as the PH Supreme Court can simply declare any ensuing contract unconstitutional and all their efforts and resources will be wasted.

In short, what I can see is a 60-40 deal where PNOC holds a 60% stake while CNOOC and PetroVietnam owns 20% each. Now, it can be argude that they are unlikely to accept such a deal.

The problem, however, is we never asked. Remember that the JMSU was just a pre-exploratory undertaking. And before anything productive happened, the JMSU expired and was never renewed.

And by the way, who benefitted from JMSUs lapse? The Salim-MVP group.

Now, this leads us to

OPTION B: Salim-MVP
This is what the Aquino administration wanted at the onset as Aquino wanted Salim-MVP to exploit Reed Bank instead of CNOOC-PNOC, and thats what Ambassador Cuisia and Del Rosario want right now.

Assuming that Forum Energy indeed manages to drill on Reed Bank, who stands to benefit? At best, it will be a 40% Indonesian, 60% Filipino venture. But it doesnt end there. Manny Pangilinan is a known puppet of Indonesias Salim Group, and it is general knowledge that his money is Salims money, hidden through corporate layers that make it difficult for the government to detect foreign ownership issues [MT].

7: Which is the Better Deal? Let's do a little math
We know for a fact that whichever option we choose, whatever we do, local companies do not have the technology to drill in the South China Sea or anywhere in the country for that matter. That is, foreign participation is necessary because we need their technology.

If we will give a minimum of 40% of Reed Bank revenues to the Indonesians anyway, why not give a maximum of 40% to the Chinese instead? Wouldnt that be a better deal?

Besides, the 60% Filipino stake in Option A will be held by PNOC, a government-owned company, so that all PNOC revenues will go directly to the government. That is, the PH government will receive taxes and fees PLUS PNOCs profits.

Now, compare that to the 60% Filipino stake in Option B where Salim-MVP has the greatest benefit, while the Government will earn only through taxes and fees, but the profits will remain in Salim-MVP hands.

To illustrate, suppose the Sampaguita Gas Field yields Php 120 in profits, and the PH government levies 20 pesos in taxes and fees, leaving 100 pesos to be distributed to shareholders.

In Option A, Php 40 goes to CNOOC and Php 60 goes to PNOC. In short, the PH Government earns Php 80 out of Php 120 profit.
In Option B, Php 40 goes to Salim and other foreign owners, Php 60 goes to Manny Pangilinan. In short, the PH Government earns 20 pesos out of the Php 120.

That is, if we talk to the Chinese, we can get 80 out of every 120. If we insist on Del Rosarios stance, we get 20 out of every 120.

I think this is a no brainer, but the Aquino Administration insists on the Salim-MVP Option, saying that we have to defend our sovereignty or some other nationalistic bullshit.
NOTE: And just to remind you again: the Aquino-Falcis brouhaha revealed that PNOY has a close friendship with Salim.
But if it were the case, then why did Manny Pangilinan, with Aquinos and Del Rosarios blessings, try to strike a deal with Chinas CNOOC in 2012 [GMA]?

Worse, MVP even offered the Spratlys to the Chinese at that time and I quote:
In an aide memoire dated May 7, 2012, Pangilinan reported on his meeting with CNOOC and listed his 11-point proposal (to) the Chinese... The proposal includes a Framework Agreement between Philex and CNOOC relating to an area of mutual interest which will be defined as the area covered by SC 72Other disputed areas (such as the Spratlys) could be included by agreement. [ABS]
Wait a second...

Del Rosario wanted us to choose Option B because ""sovereignty"", and when push came to shove, he offered our sovereignty just to get Reed Bank?

MVP, Del Rosarios backdoor negotiator, wanted Reed Bank so badly that hes willing to surrender the Spratly Islands: MVP is del Rosarios representative, he wouldnt have done that without del Rosarios imprimatur.

And who is the ultimate beneficiary should MVP and Del Rosario's plans push through?

PNOY's friend Mr. Salim.

They are taking the Filipino People for fools.

Why in the hell would the Philippines risk going into war just for the interest of del Rosario and Pangilinan? Despite it all, Karen Davila thinks theyre patriots [TP: Dear Karen].

And before I forget: Davila bought shares of Philex Petroleum, in anticipation of ""developments"".

ThinkingPinoy is willing to go hardline on China, only if Salim-MVP surrenders SC 72 to PNOC.

But surely, it wont.

8: No Media Coverage? No investigative reports?
But why does local media seem to know little about the apparent Salim-MVP-Del Rosario conspiracy?

Upton Sinclair once said, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.""

Now, consider this:
Salim-MVP owns TV5 [BM]
Salim-MVP owns the Philippine Star [Star]
The Inquirer's President and CEO's husband is the president of Chamber of Mines [Inq, CoM], which is not very happy with the current administration  [ABS].
GMA plays it safe, maybe because MVP may want to buy it again [ABS].
ABS-CBN is essentially a Liberal Party ally, it's a no-brainer.
And we are left with only one major news outlet: Rappler.

But Rappler adores del Rosario. To date, Rappler has praised del Rosario like hes some candidate for beatification by the Pope. To date, not a single Rappler article tackled del Rosarios conflicts of interest [TP: Worse than Karen].

Rappler is going bankrupt so it desperately needs additional funding. Is Rappler planning to knock on MVPs doors too?


After all, MVP said before that he wants Ressa's sorority blog [Rap].

9: The Bottom-line
One of the major triggers of the South China Sea conflict of the 2010s is the Salim Group's unfettered desire for Reed Bank, and the events listed above show that it has been machinating for years to get exactly that.

ThinkingPinoy initially suspected this to be a scheme involving only Del Rosario, MVP, and their financier Salim, but the Aquino-Falcis Saga revealed that PNOY himself, through his eerily close relationship with Salim, may be in on it.

But I might be wrong. Teddy Boy Locsin may even tell me that I am ""fucking envious"" of the Aquinos' wealth, success, looks, work ethic, and pedigree.

"On Kris Aquino's #PABoost, here's an Open Letter to Foreign Sec. Teddy Boy Locsin","Secretary Locsin, I can never be ""fucking envious"" of the things you said.
#####

Dear Sec. Teddy Boy Locsin,

Good day.

In reaction to Kris Aquino's ongoing scandals, you told everybody through your twitter account that:
""People against Kris are just fucking envious of her wealth, her looks, her work ethicshe never stops working, her success and her pedigree. Period.""



Let me correct you.

FIRST, I cannot be ""fucking envious"" of Kris Aquino's wealth: she got most of it through nepotism, influence peddling, and exploiting poor farmers in Tarlac.

Have you given Hacienda Luisita to China, or is it still part of the Philippines? Because if it still is, then I do not know what enviable wealth of Kris Aquino you're talking about.

SECOND, I cannot be ""fucking envious"" of her looks, because a large part of it comes from her wealth that she got from (see first point).

Besides, the truly wealthy will never sue anyone for just PHP 1 million. Even by your standards, that's pretty cheap.

THIRD, I cannot be ""fucking envious"" of her work ethic. If she really had a good work ethic, she would not have had the catastrophic falling out with her financial manager that is happening right now.

Work ethic is the set of moral principles a person uses in their job, and Kris Aquino's supposedly enviable work ethic includes blaming her own employees for her own medical condition.

Would you be ok if Pres. Rody Duterte fires you because of the chronic pain in his cheeks?


FOURTH, I cannot be ""fucking envious"" of her success. Her continued success is from her taking advantage of personal scandals. She'll never be the Filipina Oprah Winfrey, because she has always been the Filipina Kim Kardashian West.

Besides, if she is really as successful as you would like us to think, she won't be so insecure that she even felt the need to fund political black propagandists just to protect her ""queendom"", whatever that means.


FIFTH, I can never be ""fucking envious"" of her pedigree because  I don't crave for dog food and  she comes from a family who made it a business to exploit and murder the poor.

I am very open to an extensive public discussion about Kris Aquino's pedigree, and I will start with a sub-topic on the History of Philippine Land Reform.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I can never be ""fucking envious"" of her period. And at her ripe age of 47, it's about to go away anyway.

I understand your predilection toward defending the Aquino women, especially since you were Pres. Corazon Aquino's speechwriter and Press Secretary... but to simply dismiss as ""fucking envy"" the public's legitimate criticisms against Kris Aquino's funding of political black propaganda?

Sec. Locsin, please use your own wealth, looks, success, pedigree, and work ethic in coming up with a smarter and less elitist tweet.

But I guess you won't feel the need to listen to me because just like regular Filipino, I do not have wealth, looks, success, and pedigree.

But unlike you, Sec. Locsin, I wish to believe that regular Filipinos like me have loftier ideals than just wealth, looks, and pedigree.",RJ Nieto,"January 9, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/01/ris-aquino-paboost-open-letter-teddy-boy-locsin.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#PABoost: Kris Aquino, the showbiz cockroach, bit off more social media fodder than she can chew","After the Nagasaki and Hiroshima nuclear attacks, reports came out that cockroaches were the only creatures that survived the two blasts. With that said, I think it can be argued that Kris Aquino is the showbiz equivalent of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima Cockroaches, with her atomic blasts being the many scandals she survived throughout her showbiz career.

And what's the problem? Kris Aquino's #PABoost Scandal, the latest atomic blast,  is something that even a cockroach like her may not survive.

[UPDATE: Kris Aquino admitted several hours after this article's publication that she indeed financed opposition bloggers. See embedded image below]


ANALYZING ANALYTICS DATA
Recall the controversial Pep.ph article ""Nicko Falcis swears Kris Aquino said: 'PAPAPATAY KA NG PAMILYA KO'"", that most likely triggered her latest press conference.

I used an analytics app to find out how the said article went viral on social media and I discovered something really interesting: For the Motherland - Sass Rogando Sasot and Thinking Pinoy appears to have influenced a large chunk -- if not the largest chunk -- of shares that Pep.phs article garnered.

Facebook's CrowdTangle comes as a Google Chrome extension app that instantly provides social media analytics data of any given page.

Facebook's CrowdTangle, a service that describes itself as a tool to ""measure social performance and identify influencers with tools designed for publishers."", is a great tool to find out how a given article spreads through Social Media, and that's what I used here.

Going back, analytics data shows most of the article's traffic basically came from TP and Sass' followers, people who are very well aware of the #PABoost controversy, where various screenshots released by the camp of her estranged financial manager Nicko Falcis

KRIS WILFULLY IGNORED #PABOOST
If Kris Aquino's massive social media team is worth its salt, it should also be totally aware of the allegations that Aquino's been funding at least one political propagandist [TP: #PABoost]. Thus, Aquino must have also been aware of the issue, unless her social media people are too scared of telling her about it for fear of suffering the same fate as her former financial manager.

Nah! Kris must know about #PABoost: shes known to be really good at PR work and shes not totally stupid.

Despite this, Aquino in her live video reply to the Pep article totally ignored the #PABoost Scandal and instead resorted to various appeals to emotion: her kids' welfare, her parents' legacy, her supposedly serious medical issues, and what not.

But then, there are two important details that Aquino mentioned in her live video:
 That her endorsement deals are under threat, supposedly because of the health clause in those contracts. 
 That she will take a 14-day hiatus from social media, supposedly per doctors advice

And heres where it gets interesting.

These two bits of information from Aquino, mentioned in the previous section, should be taken with a grain of salt. However, whats clear and stipulatable so far are:
 That her endorsement deals are under threat, and
 That she will take a 14-day break from social media.
Yes, Aquino cited health concerns to justify both, but considering that someone like her whos concededly more than adept at Public Relations, I cannot help but think that the alibi is all-too-convenient.

POLITICS AND PRODUCT ENDORSERS
Companies who want to sell to as large a chunk of the population want their endorsers to be likable by the largest possible audience. On the other hand, political discourse is inherently divisive. Thus, theres a widely-held notion in the advertising industry that product endorsers should never delve too deeply in politics because it limits their ability to enhance product sales.

I admit that sans a courtroom trial, we can never definitively prove beyond reasonable doubt that Aquino is funding opposition propagandists. The preponderance of evidence pointing to it, however,  appears to be more than enough to convince the Court of Public Opinion.

And theres the problem: Kris has hundreds of millions worth of endorsement deals from companies who would most likely prefer getting apolitical endorsers. Aquino herself admitted not too long ago that she chose not to run for office in the 2019 midterm elections for fear of losing these contracts.
But rumors of a senatorial run pale in comparison to accusations of financing political propaganda.

That is, I have reason to believe that Aquinos involvement in the #PABoost Scandal may have started to become a hot topic in more than a few company boardrooms, likely resulting to more than a few company directors suggestions to ditch Aquino in favor of a new endorser who can reach a larger segment of their target markets.


Vice Ganda, for example, is a suitable alternative endorser for products that cater to socioeconomic classes C, D, E.

Vice Ganda (L) and Kris Aquino (R)
Surely, Vice Ganda endorsing Uni-Pak sardines will most likely result in better sales than a haciendera Kris Aquino doing the same. We all know that Kris is a socialite to the bone and we hardly expect her to buy Uni-Pak. She probably even feeds something more expensive to her dogs.

The relatable Vice Ganda, despite her inclination towards Duterte as shown in what happened during Dutertes July 2015 Gandang Gabi Vice guesting, remains largely apolitical, unlike Aquino whos even funding political bloggers.


I believe that the treat to her endorsement deals are less about her medical condition and more about her politics.


And this theory is further reinforced by her supposedly self-imposed 14-day break from Social Media.

WHY 14 DAYS?
Aquino in her live video announced a 14-day hiatus from social media supposedly to avoid stress that her doctors supposedly said could worsen her Lupus.

What I find odd, however, is the seemingly arbitrarily chosen length of her hiatus. Why 14 days? Why not 7? Why not longer? Did her doctors tell her that shell be significantly healthier in just 14 days, healthy enough to deal with social media-induced stress?

I doubt it. Aquino herself admitted to being allergic to Lupus-related medicines, and Lupus in itself is incurable. If Aquino indeed decided to take a break from social media due to her medical condition, the break should be for a much longer period of, say, at least a few months or even a year.

But 14 days, just 14 days?

Social media is a fast-paced environment where issues enjoy a very short shelf life. The talk of the town today will most likely be forgotten as soon as another issue comes up. For example, the Tony Labrusca airport scandal along with rumors about his sexuality that erupted earlier this week have been relegated to the sidelines right after Aquinos press conference.


That is, I cannot help but think that the 14-day hiatus is less about her health and more about preserving whats left of her showbiz career. That is, it appears that shes hoping that the #PABoost scandal would have died down by the end of her vacation.


KRIS AQUINO, THE COCKROACH OF SHOWBIZ
Right after the United States dropped atomic bombs in Nagasaki and Hiroshima during the Second World War, reports came out that cockroaches were the only creatures that survived the two blasts. And I think everyone will agree that in this respect, Kris Aquino is the showbiz equivalent of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima Cockroaches, with her atomic bombs being the many scandals she survived throughout her showbiz career.

Do you still remember
her affair with the married actor Philip Salvador that produced a baby?
her (yet another) affair with comedian Joey Marquez where she even claimed to have contracted STDs?
her much-publicized rift with her erstwhile best buddy and actress Ai-ai de las Alas?
her seemingly apocalyptic breakup with baller James Yap that includes a protracted custody battle over their child?
These are just some of the many scandals she faced throughout the decades.

Oh, and I forgot Bistek!
Kris Aquino did not only survive all these scandals: she even deftly used the publicity to boost her popularity that, in turn, allowed her to snag multi-million-peso endorsement contracts, catapulting her to top of the Bureau of Internal Revenues top individual taxpayers list.

But there the abovementioned scandals share one common denominator, a common denominator that the recent Aquino-Falcis #PABoost Scandal doesnt have.

KEEPING IT PERSONAL
The past scandals enumerated in the previous section have one thing in common: the issues are extremely personal in nature, so that the public has no significant stake in the matter.

Any regular Filipino who watched each of these quite entertaining events unfold knows full well that nothing in his life change whatever happens.


Contrast that to the Aquino-Falcis #PABoost Scandal that, unlike the previous ones, took on a very political dimension. What initially started as a financial squabble slowly metamorphosed into a political issue after Aquino was found out to have been significantly funding anti-government political propagandists.

Her financing an opposition-aligned blogger wouldnt have mattered much if it happened in the 2000s. But a product endorser doing the same is a terrible idea at an age where every Pedro, Pablo, and Pekto is actively engaged in political discourse, and 74% of every Pedro, Pablo, and Pekto are satisfied with the Duterte Administration.


Unlike Kris Aquinos previous scandals, the public now has a stake in her kerfuffle with Falcis. That is, the general public, instead of watching her make a fool of herself as usual just for kicks, feel that any semblance of victory on Kris Aquinos part is a major blow against general public interest.

After all, if Kris Aquino emerges victorious through-and-through, then she can just continue funding anti-government propagandists, to the detriment of Filipinos who are sick and tired of the brand of governance that her brother and former president Noynoy Aquinos opposition espouses.

Kris Aquino, as a product endorser, is basically a salesperson. Now, imagine a salesperson who tells you that you made a stupid decision to support your president then, at the same breath, attempt to sell you Uni-Pak sardines, Ariel detergent, UFC ketchup, Marca Pia soy sauce and what not?

Thats ridiculous: Id rather buy Ligo, Tide, Hunt's Ketchup, and Datu Puti, than help support the livelihood of Kris Aquino, the Kris Aquino who supports the livelihood of propagandists that will bring my country back to the nightmares of Yolanda and Mamasapano.

[UPDATE: Readers pointed out that Tide, like Ariel, is from Procter and Gamble. So I'll just buy Surf, I guess.]

Kris Aquino's many endorsement deals.
The latest developments in the Aquino-Falcis #PABoost brouhaha suggests that Kris is now in a scandal that she, unlike before, cannot possibly take advantage of.

Kris Aquino basically bit off more social media fodder than she can chew.

Will she continue to fund political propagandists after this?

I do not know, but whats clear is that the Liberal Partygoers, who so fervently paint their social media bloggers as selfless, patriotic, and independent activists, cannot do so anymore.

Why? Because Kris Aquino proved that Liberal Partys ogrish poster girl for social media  Pinoy Ako Blogs Jover Laurio that she herself finances  is a paid hack.

As for Vice Ganda's manager, I strongly suggest that you take even greater care of your talent's interests right away. Here's an opportunity. Grab it",RJ Nieto,"January 6, 2019",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2019/01/paboost-kris-aquino-showbiz-cockroach.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#PABoost: Exploring Jover Laurio's financial links to the oppositionist Liberal Party,"Who knew that Kris Aquino's estranged financial manager would reopen a gigantic can of worms?

If there's such a thing as VP Leni Robredo's ""well-oiled machinery"", this must be it.

International Relations scholar, Maastricht University lecturer, and political blogger Sass Sasot earlier pointed out a blatant contradiction:
If Pinoy Ako Blog's Jover Laurio sued Franco Mabanta simply for calling her ugly, why didn't she sue those who, as she claims, send her round-the-clock death threats?
The anti-administration blogger Laurio has been literally telling the world that she eats death threats for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, yet why hasnt she sued anyone for it, despite the fact that she has already sued others for far lesser offenses?

I can vividly remember the time when Laurio sued Mabanta for libel just because he called her ugly:


Of course, threats against Laurio's life are far worse than threats against her ego, unless she believes her ego is more important than her life, which would necessitate Laurio's tacit admission that she's a moron and that will never happen.

With that said, I see only two remaining possibilities:
 Laurio herself believes the death threats are all bark and no bite.
 Laurio believes the death threats are serious but she can't sue.
If the none of the deaths threats Laurios been bragging about are credible, then Laurio is simply one big fat ugly lying megalomanic ogre. By virtue of the dismissed Laurio v Mabanta libel case, however, Laurio at the least maintains that she's not ugly, so the second possibility must hold, right?

But why didn't she sue?

MEANS, MOTIVE, OPPORTUNITY
Suing someone requires three things:  Means,  Motive, and  Opportunity.

Assuming the existence of significantly grave threats, Motive is already present. Moreover, she can simply approach a state prosecutor to file a case, just like what she did in Laurio v Mabanta, so the Opportunity is there. With Motive and Opportunity present, the question is why she hasnt sued people for grave threats can be simplified into a question of whether Laurio has the means or not.


More specifically, does Laurio have the financial capacity to pay for the case filing fees, legal costs, and ancillary expenses associated with suing another person for grave threats?

Apparently not, and there lies yet another seeming contradiction.

Where did she get the money to sue Mabanta in the first place? Aside from Mabanta, she also sued bloggers RJ Nieto (Thinking Pinoy blog) and Sass Sasot (For the Motherland blog) for breach of data privacy, a civil case whose filing fee alone costs around Php 60,000 pesos?

Where did she get the money for these two cases, and why cant she get more money for a new one?

LAURIOS FINANCIAL STANDING
In #PABoost: There's another fishy thing about this anti-admin blogger's page financials where Thinking Pinoy examined Laurios finances, TP explained that considering that she  claims to be poor,  lacks a donation link on her websites, and  uses no 3rd-party crowdfunding platform, she cannot possibly afford the costly advertisements she runs on her Facebook page. For one, she had at least 6 sponsored posts for May 2018 alone, and shes running 3 sponsored posts as of 03 January 2019.


The same article went on to explain that Jover must have one or more external political financiers, like a former presidents sister (READ: Kris Aquino) as shown in a leaked chat screenshot, to foot the bill for Laurios costly social media promotions.


Is it possible that one or more of the political financiers (e.g. Kris Aquino) who have been funding Laurios sponsored posts are also funding the legal battles that Laurio herself initiated and if so, why are they reluctant to finance a case against those who supposedly threaten Laurios very life?

The skeptic (I encourage skepticism) may still insist that evidence pointing towards Laurios financial links to these politicial financiers is still lacking, given that what has been established to far is just Laurios financial links with Kris Aquino and little else.

And thats what well tackle right next.

MORE THAN SPECULATION: REMEMBER COCOYGATE
Recall the Thinking Pinoy article #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for that was used as resource material for an October 2017 senate hearing, which eventually led to the Philippine Senate issuing a subpoena against opposition propagandist and Aquino-era Presidential Communications consultant Edward Angelo Cocoy Dayao.

The article demonstrated, among other things, that the Pinoy Ako Blog website (PinoyAkoBlog.com) and several other sites controlled by Cocoy Dayao run advertisements from a SINGLE Google Adsense Publisher ID, i.e. a SINGLE Google Adsense Account.


Every Google ad shown on a webpage is linked to a publisher ID owned by the person who receives ad revenues. Thus, several websites whose Google ads use the same publisher ID (i.e. same Google AdSense account) are either owned or controlled by whoever owns that AdSense Account.

In the same article, I explained that in as late as 2017, PinoyAkoBlog.com shared the same AdSense Account (ID: pub-1068157602481996) as several anti-administration pages like ChangeScamming and BackroomPolitics.

Aside from these three, the same Adsense account is used in political sites such as:

anunabes.com - a supposedly hip news site whose associated facebook page didnt pick up steam and thus was apparently abandoned.
dikukurap.com - a fake news site that calls Duterte supporters Duterte D*ck Suckers
dotreport.org - an seemingly abandoned and generally oppositionist opinion blog.
duterteadminnews.com - an apparently pro-Duterte site but its Facebook page got only 92 likes, suggesting that whatever Cocoys plans here were abandoned. There are only 4 posts.
fightfortruth.club - supposedly a fact checking site, although it focuses only on fact checking obviously fake news sites using a clear anti-administration bias. Updated once a week.
FixPH.org - another fake news site that called Senator Gordon a d*ck as it accused the senator of conniving with Sen. Pimentel in a power grabe against Sen. De Lima.
kolektibo.com - a seemingly abandoned pro-Duterte site.
PilipinongPalaban.com - a staunchly pro-Leni site. No traction though.
politikanginamo.com - another fake news site. According to one of its more recent articles, Wapakels (si Duterte) kung bata man o matanda, buntis o may kapansanan, inosente man o hindi. Basta sabihin ng mga DDS army na adik ka, patay ka!
SocialPatrol.ph - an Liberal Party-leaning website where one of the articles even talks about The Lighter Side of the Senator Trillanes AMA on Reddit

In short, there is ONLY ONE PERSON who receives all the ad revenues from all these sites, and that one person must either be Jover Laurio or Cocoy Dayao.
But then, the writer doubts that Laurio owns the AdSense account because on the following grounds:
 The websites have different writing styles. Simple content analysis will suggest that they are written by different people.
 Laurio manages to write only 20 to 30 short posts weekly on PinoyAkoBlog and judging from the quality and quantity of her blog posts, she cannot possibly handle all these websites.
 Laurio never claimed to have managed any of these other sites.
 Laurio claims to be a simple blogger, not a web programmer. 
 Laurio managing so many sites by herself is illogical because it would destroy her supposed image as an independent honest-to-goodness political blogger.

That is, Cocoy Dayao most likely owns the Google AdSense Account with Publisher ID pub-1068157602481996.


Now, keep that last sentence in mind as we go to the next section.

LAURIOS WEBSITE STILL RUNS DAYAOS ADS
Out of sheer curiosity, the writer visited PinoyAkoBlog.com on 04 January 2019 at 1:00 PM to check if it still serves Google Advertisements and still does.

A screenshot of PinoyAkoBlog.com taken on 04 January 2019. It features a 320x100 pixel Google Ad (see yellow arrow).

Here's a video recording taken on 04 June 2019 showing that the Pinoy Ako Blog website still serves ads under publisher ID pub-1068157602481996:


That is, a quick inspection of the ad served in an 04 January 2019 blog post yields the publisher ID pub-1068157602481996, or ads from THE SAME DAYAO-OWNED ADSENSE ACCOUNT mentioned in 2017.

As of 04 January 2019, Cocoy Dayao still receives the ad revenues generated by Jover Laurios Pinoy Ako Blog website.

In short, Laurio is still under Dayao as of this articles writing and who is Dayao under?

The opposition Liberal Party, on the following grounds:

FIRST, Dayao was a paid consultant of the Presidential Communications Operations Office during the presidency of Noynoy Aquino (Liberal Party), as evidenced by the PCOO payout form shown below:


SECOND, Dayao manages the official website of Liberal Party president and Philippine Senator Francis Kiko Pangilinan. Dayao himself admitted this in [Labrats], one of the websites Dayao owns.

Cocoy Dayao himself admitted in his own website LabRats.me that Pangilinan is a client.


THIRD, Evidence also suggests that Dayao still controlled Pangilinans website when in days after the 2017 #CocoyGate senate hearing, Pangilinans website, along with other Dayao-controlled websites, simultaneously went down, as shown below:


That is, evidence suggests that Dayao is a Liberal Party lackey.

CONNECTING THE DOTS
Laurio writes in PinoyAkoBlog, PinoyAkoBlog is under Dayao, and Dayao is under the Liberal Party and this still holds true as of 04 January 2019.

Laurio cannot possibly argue that she knew nothing about Dayaos superiors because her wedding invitation (shown below) suggests otherwise, as her list of principal sponsors include:

1. Vice-president and Liberal Party chairwoman Leni Robredo
2. LP-aligned Senator Antonio Trillanes
3. LP-aligned Senator Risa Hontiveros
4. LP-aligned Rep. Gary Alejano, Trillanes de facto alter-ego in the House of Representatives
5. LP Senator Bam Aquino, who also happens to be benefactor Kris Aquinos nephew
6. Former President Noynoy Aquinos sister Kris Aquino herself
7. LP stalwart Imelda Nicolas, one of the central figures in #LeniLeaks: Inside Leni Robredo's international propaganda machinery and the sister of another LP stalwart billionaire Loida Nicolas-Lewis.

And most importantly

8. Senator Kiko Pangilinan himself, Dayaos client and president of the Liberal Party.
Here's a photo of the wedding invitation:


Theres a preponderance of evidence showing that more than just Kris Aquino, the Liberal Party itself has strong financial links to Pinoy Ako Blogs Jover Laurio up to this day, contrary to Laurios claim that shes just a simple, honest blogger.

Simply put, evidence very strongly suggests that Jover Laurio, the Philippine Daily Inquirers Person of the Year, is nothing more than a Liberal Party-funded propagandist.

Laurio is just one among many opposition bloggers and Pinoy Ako Blog is just one among many opposition blogs, so just how many opposition blogs receive financial support from the Liberal Party?

When VP Leni Robredo accused the Duterte government of having a well-oiled machinery for propaganda, I can only surmise that she based this solely on the fact that her own Liberal Party has one, so that the other side must also have its own.

#PABoost: There's another fishy thing about this anti-admin blogger's page financials,"With the financial manager of the former presidential sister gone, who's funding Pinoy Ako Blog's active sponsored posts today?

I think this issue is especially relevant today. 

Since Pres. Rody Duterte assumed office in 2016, opposition figures, such as Rappler, have accused administration-aligned blogs such as MOCHA USON BLOG, For the Motherland - Sass Rogando Sasot, Thinking Pinoy, of receiving financial support from administration personalities.

To this day, these accusations are still bereft of any tangible evidence, accusations that the blogs' respective owners categorically deny.

The irony? Evidence shows that at least one opposition blog -- Pinoy Ako Blog -- is guilty of what the opposition accuses the three bloggers listed above.

LAURIO ADMITS FALCIS AS BENEFACTOR
The vehemently anti-administration Pinoy Ako Blog page owner Jover Laurio reportedly admitted to having accepted financial support through Nicko Falcis who, at the time, was Kris Aquino's financial manager.

This is after the release of the controversial 2018 chat screenshots, with one having taken place in April 2018 (see image) and showing that Laurio requested Falcis to boost her posts, i.e. pay for her blog's sponsored posts, to which Falcis agreed.

IS IT REALLY FALCIS... OR HIS EMPLOYER?
As Sass Rogando Sasot pointed out, it would've been illogical for Falcis to have use his personal funds because he has a brother who also has an anti-administration blog with a following, reach, and engagement comparable to Laurio's.

That is, if Falcis were to support an anti-administration blogger, he must've supported his own brother and not Laurio. Moreover, in as far as this writer can recall, his brother's blog never ran sponsored posts.

These circumstances suggest that Kris Aquino herself -- Falcis' employer at the time -- is funding Laurio's sponsored posts, with Falcis as an intermediary.

Unfortunately, Falcis and Aquino parted ways at around June 2018.


BUT THE SPONSORED POSTS DIDN'T STOP
Despite the loss of the supposed intermediary, a quick look at the ""Info and Ads"" section of Pinoy Ako Blog page shows that it still running sponsored posts as of 11:00 PM GMT+8, 03 January 2019 [http://archive.fo/8Gp0I], or about half a year since Falcis left Aquino.

In an attempt at greater transparency, Facebook recently added the ""Info and Ads"" section to pages to allow users to check what ads a given page is running.

With that said, who's paying for her sponsored posts today?

There two initial possibilities:  Laurio herself, or  Somebody else.


CAN LAURIO AFFORD HER SPONSORED POSTS?
Laurio maintains her claims  that's she's the sole blogger behind the page and  that she's of meager financial standing, so it can't be Laurio herself, i.e. it must be somebody else.

Laurio could not crowdfund her sponsored posts, considering that  her blog site has no tip jar (e.g. a PayPal Philippines donation link) and  she still has no third-party funding (e.g. Patreon).

She does run Google Ads on her website, but she chose to display only one small 320x100 pixel banner that, from this writer's own experience, likely earns no more than $0.15 per 1000 hits.

Her website has an average of 300,000 monthly hits (and dropping), based on her SimilarWeb stats over the past 6 months [http://bit.ly/2QiBHvj], so that her monthly Google AdSense revenues should be no more than $45 or about Php 2,400. 
She's currently running 3 sponsored posts and judging from her reportedly suggested Php 3,000 budget per post, this must cost around P9,000.

Laurio blogs about current events so the posts have a very short shelf life, so that P3,000 budget per post cannot be spread over an extended period, i.e. she must burn the amount (P9,000 for 3 posts) in less than 1 month.


In short, Ad revenues are not enough to fund her paid posts.


Suffice it to say, evidence suggests that she must have one or more financiers.

WHO IS/ARE LAURIO'S CURRENT FUNDERS?
I see three possibilities here that can be explored:

 Kris Aquino may be supporting the blog, possibly through a new intermediary, i.e. somebody other than Falcis

 Cocoy Dayao, the Noynoy Aquino-era Presidential Communications (Government of the Philippines) consultant and the web administrator of a plethora of anti-administration websites today, which includes Laurio's Pinoy Ako Blog (and Kiko Pangilinan's official website) [http://bit.ly/CocoyGate]... 
...but Cocoy has no personal motive to do this, i.e. Cocoy Dayao sources funds from an political benefactor.  
 Other opposition personalities. This doesn't discount the possibility that they may have been supporting Pinoy Ako Blog even before Falcis left Aquino.

All these three possibilities point to one thing: that Laurio receives financial benefits from opposition-aligned political personalities, which is exactly what the opposition has been accusing pro-administration bloggers of receiving. 

Laurio reportedly denies having received cash from any political personality. However, the fact that she never took the initiative to disclose sources of her funding (READ: Political Personalities), only to admit one source after she got caught red-handed, casts a significant doubt on her credibility.

Laurio ever so proudly claims that she blogs ""para sa bayan (for the nation)"", but she appears to be blogging for more than just that. 

But here's the more important question: 

Aside from Laurio, who among the other opposition-aligned bloggers receive financial support from opposition politicians?

That would be very interesting to know.

"Mislatel Franchise Revoked? SEC filings suggest non-compliance, but...","Will the Philippines ever succeed in breaking the Telco duopoly? There is hope, kinda.



Several days ago, consumer watchdog Infrawatch PH pointed out that the provisional third Philippine Telecommunications providers franchise is deemed revoked after the latter allegedly failed to list its stocks in the Philippine Stock Exchange [Star].

Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company Inc (Mislatel), which received its 25-year franchise in 1998 via Republic Act 8627 [CorpusJuris], is required to public offer 30% of its stocks through the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) lest its franchise be deemed revoked.


More than a headache for the Mislatel Consortium, this is a source of much consternation among the Filipino Public desperately in need of better telco services. Thus, in this article, let me attempt to explain the situation so that the reader may gain a better idea of what to expect with respect to the future of Philippine Telecommunications.

AN ANSWER TO THE ALLEGATIONS
RA 8627 Sec. 16 states:
""[Mislatel] shall offer at least... 30%... of its... stock... in any securities exchange in the Philippines within... 5... years from the commencement of its operations. Noncompliance... render(s) the franchise ipso facto revoked.""
If the allegations that Mislatel may have indeed failed to list its stocks in the PSE, then it appears that the telcos franchise is indeed revoked.

In a clarificatory statement regarding Mislatel's franchise validity, Chelsea Holdings Corporation responded [PSE]:
""...the NTC published a list of... existing... franchises... (and) Mislatel... was included... In addition, the NTC has accepted the validity of the Mislatel franchise when it vetted Mislatels documents...""
Chelsea is part of the provisional third telco consortium, along with China Telecom and Mislatel parent company Udenna Corporation.

The companies comprising the Mislatel Consortium. Udenna is Mislatel's parent company.

A TANGENTIAL RESPONSE, AT BEST
Clearly, Mislatel's franchise requires the it to offer 30% of its stocks to the public via a listing in any local stock exchange. Since the PSE is the only local stock exchange, then those stocks must be listed in the PSE.

Allegations of Mislatels failure to enlist in PSE surfaced after NTC declared it as the provisional third telco. If true, this may imply that Mislatels franchise  the right to operate  is deemed revoked, preventing it from becoming the countrys third telco provider.
Mislatel supposedly responded to the allegation through a clarificatory statement published by the PSE. In the statement, Mislatel claimed:

that NTC published a list of telcos with active franchises and Mislatel is in that list, and,
that NTC vetted Mislatel's franchise and it was found valid.

Mislatel basically claimed in the statement that its franchise is valid because the NTC said so, but is that really how it works?

TRILLANES AMNESTY AND MISLATELS DEFENSE
This issue is quite similar to the Trillanes Amnesty Case.

Mislatel critics are questioning the validity of its franchise based on whether the telco complied with requirements set forth in its franchise terms or not. In response, Mislatel essentially said, NTC said its valid, so its valid.

On the other hand, the Philippine government questioned the validity of Senator Antonio Trillanes amnesty in relation to the Oakwood Mutiny and Manila Peninsula Siege based on whether Trillanes complied with the requirements set forth in the pertinent amnesty proclamation. In response, Trillanes showed his amnesty certificate [ABS], essentially saying that The Aquino Administration said its valid, so its valid.

The amnesty document, however, is insufficient to debunk the allegations against Trillanes, as Trillanes even submitted to submit copies of his amnesty application, along with an affidavit of admission. Trillanes even submitted additional evidence to support his claim [ABS].

Using the same argument, Mislatel cannot simply invoke NTCs approval of its application. Instead, it must directly answer the allegations that it never went public in accordance with its franchise terms.

THE QUINTESSENTIAL QUESTION
In short, Mislatel could have simply said, Hey, we did offer 30% of our stocks so youre wrong, and we would have gotten this whole thing over with. But Mislatel, so far, hasnt done anything to that effect, as it uses the Trillanes Strategy to address the issue.

Mislatel's response is tangential at best as it does not address the allegations head on, as the clarificatory statement didnt really answer the very simple, very basic, and very crucial question:
Did Mislatel attempt go public with 30% of its stocks as required in its franchise terms, yes or no?
The central point of contention is whether Mislatel publicly offered, or at least intended to offer, 30% of its stocks through the PSE as required in the franchise terms. The telco has so far been mum about this.

If Mislatel indeed failed to publicly offer 30% of its stocks, then the debate is over: Mislatels license is deemed revoked, thereby disqualify the telco from participating in the industry entirely. Hence, lets assume, for the sake of argument, that it actually did publicly offer stocks.

READING BETWEEN THE LINES OF CHELSEAS STATEMENT
I would like to direct the readers attention to the fact that Chelsea [PSE], and NOT Mislatel, issued the clarificatory statement in the PSE website, the same statement that was widely used in various news reports from major media outlets.

The clarificatory statement, submitted to the PSE and SEC, is meant to assuage Chelseas stockholders, who may be worried about the allegations against its partner Mislatel.
But then, if 30% of Mislatels stocks are publicly held, then why does it appear that Mislatel didnt bother to assuage its public stockholders? Why didnt Mislatel submit to the PSE and SEC a clarificatory statement similar to Chelseas?

Now, some camps may raise the possibility that Mislatel may just be late in filing the statement, but it has to be pointed out that Mislatel, its parent company Udenna, and Chelsea are either controlled or fully owned by a single person: the Davao-based business tycoon Dennis Uy.


That is, if Chelsea can quickly whip up a statement, I think its reasonable to expect the same speed on Mislatels part. Moreover, it can also be reasonably expected that Mislatel, a supposedly publicly traded company, can have that statement published on the PSE website.

But neither happened. Thus, surrounding facts suggest that Mislatel is indeed not listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange, thus failing to comply with a requirement in its telco franchise terms.

A LOOK AT MISLATELS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE
I managed to get a copy of Mislatels 2015 General Information Sheet (GIS), the SEC filing that describes the companys ownership structure. But before we go through that, let me explain what exactly well be looking for in the GIS.

Mislatels received its franchise in the form of RA 8627 in 1998, and three basic franchise terms were laid out under Section 7. That is, Mislatels franchise is deemed revoked if it fails to:

Commence operations within one  year from the approval of its permit by the NTC, or
Operate continuously for two  years, or
Commence operations within three  years from the effectivity of this Act.

Thus, assuming that Mislatels franchise is still valid and active to this day and given that the franchise was granted in 1998, then it must have commenced operations no later than 2001.

Now, Section 16 of the same Act requires Mislatel to go public with 30% of its stocks within five years from the commencement of its operations, so that Mislatel should have done so no later than 5 years after 2001, i.e. 2006.


Let me state this clearly: if Mislatels franchise is valid and active in 2018, then it must have gone public with 30% of its shares no later than 2006.

However, a look at Mislatels 2015 GIS shows that 99.98% of its stocks are owned by just five persons in 2015:

Marte Lascano, with 3.75 million shares, owns owns 25.00%
Romeo Sabillo, with 3.75 million shares, owns owns 25.00%
Edward Evangelista, with 3.00 million shares, owns owns 19.99%
Winsberg Austria, with 3.00 million shares, owns owns 19.99%
Mariano Pamintuan, with 1.50 million shares, owns owns 10.00%

A photo of the relevant page in the GIS is shown below.



Thus, Mislatel HAS NOT GONE PUBLIC as of 2015, which is almost a decade past the deadline. In short, judging by the Mislatels franchise terms, Mislatels license to operate is deemed revoked.


[Note that its highly likely Dennis Uy may have acquired Mislatel after 2015, which will explain why his name is not on the list. The date of Uy's acquisition, however, is irrelevant to the issues at hand.]


DEFENSES: IS MISLATELS FRANCHISE REALLY DEEMED REVOKED?
Well, thats a bit tricky. I have consulted several lawyer-friends who are well-versed in corporate law and they told me that at first glance, Mislatels apparent failure to go public may have indeed resulted in the revocation of its franchise.

They said, however, that Mislatel may have several possible ways to get out of this PR and legal mess.
[NOTE: I have decided against naming who these lawyer-friends are because some of them belong to high-profile law firms who may be hired by one or more of the parties mentioned in this article, and I do not want to jeopardize their prospective cases.]

DEFENSE 1: STOCKS PUBLICLY OFFERED BUT ZERO TAKERS
The franchise terms used the term shall offer, meaning that it requires Mislatel to publicly offer stocks but not necessarily succeed in selling them. If Mislatel indeed publicly offered its stocks within the required timeframe but there were no takers, then Mislatel may still be deemed compliant with the franchise terms.

In short, Mislatel can argue Substantial Compliance, defined as compliance with the substantial or essential requirements of a statute that satisfies its purpose or objective even though its formal requirements are not complied with [FindLaw].

In this respect, we must verify if Mislatel continuously attempted to offer its stocks and there have always been zero buyers. If Mislatel manages to do that then its all ok. Otherwise, this alibi wont fly.


DEFENSE 2: PSES REFUSAL TO LIST MISLATELS STOCKS
Listing a new companys stocks in the Philippine Stock Exchange is fraught with myriad challenges, so many that its possible that PSE rejected Mislatels attempt to list its stocks in the bourse. This can happen if, among other reasons, PSE deemed Mislatel stocks to be not valuable enough, making trading of its stocks a waste of time and resources.

Thus, Mislatel may be deemed compliant with franchise terms if Mislatel spent a reasonable amount of effort to list its stocks but the PSE refused to cooperate. That is, if Mislatel did everything in its power to comply but the PSE didnt budge, then Mislatel can argue in the courts that it can still be deemed compliant.

Mislatel can again argue Substantial Compliance. 


DEFENSE 3: THE NOT-REALLY-A-DEFENSE DEFENSE
The first two potential defenses described above apply to arguing the validity of Mislatels franchise. This third one, on the other hand, appeals to the more practical side of things.

Let me explain further.

Possession is nine-tenths of the law, or so the saying goes. The fact of the matter is that the NTC has declared Mislatel as the provisional third telco and this declaration enjoys the presumption of regularity.

Infrawatch PH, the NGO that raised the franchise issue, can sue Mislatel in an attempt to freeze the bidding process. However, my lawyer-friends and I have doubts on whether the NGO has the legal personality to challenge the NTC decision, especially since Infrawatch is not among the losing bidders.

More likely than not, this information will instead be used by the losing bidder, and it appears to be the case. However, while Velardes NOW Telecom [GMA] and Singsons Sear Telecom [ABS] are hell bent on challenging the legality of NTCs decision, NTC and Mislatel can still choose to proceed with everything.

Yes, everything. 


Former Ilocos Sur Governor Chavit Singson owns Sear Telecom, one of the aspiring third telco players.
That means NTC and Mislatel can perform the remaining steps to complete the regulatory processes, then the Mislatel Consortium starts operating and providing telco services, all while NOW and Sear are fighting it out in courts.

Of course, we cannot discount the possibility that NOW or Sear may be able to secure a timely Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction from the courts and I have reason to believe they will get it, as the 2015 Mislatel GIS is prima facie evidence that Mislatel failed to go public.

But theres the option to post a counter-bond.

POST COUNTER-BOND THEN ARGUE PUBLIC BENEFIT
However, considering that this is just a civil case, Mislatel can simply use Rule 58 Section 6 of the Rules of Court [LawPhil], which allows it to post a counter-bond to dissolve the TRO and Injunction.

Let me explain this a little bit.

Suppose NOW or Sear sues Mislatel and the courts grant a TRO against Mislatel, preventing Mislatel from commencing operations, after NOW or Sear argued that enforcing the NTC decision will cause the complainant significant financial damages. Mislatel can then ask the courts if it can just post a counter-bond conditioned that Mislatel will pay NOW or Sear if Mislatel loses the civil case. The courts will set the counter-bonds amount.

Of course, we are talking about astronomical amounts here, so it all boils down to the question of whether Mislatel, i.e. Davao tycoon Dennis Uy, is wealthy enough to take the hit, and I am pretty confident that he is.

With a counter-bond posted and assuming that all NTC-related processes have been completed, Mislatel can start operating and providing telco services to the public while the civil case is still pending in the courts.

If Mislatel wins the civil case years later, then business as usual. If Mislatel loses the case, it loses the amount posted as a counter-bond but it can still argue that the company is providing substantial benefit to the public so the courts should still allow it to operate.

Imagine this: we currently have a Smart-Globe telco duopoly. If the courts decide years from now against Mislatel and forces the latter to stop operating, the Smart-Globe-Mislatel triopoly reverts to a duopoly as it will take considerable time, possibly years, for Mislatels replacement to commence operations, and that can be argued as severely detrimental to Public Interest.

In short, provisional third telco Mislatel may (emphasis on ""may"") still continue to operate regardless of the outcome of a civil case. That is, if Dennis Uy is willing and able to shoulder the astronomical expenses associated with it.

And I am pretty confident he is.",RJ Nieto,"November 11, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/11/mislatel-franchise-sec-filing-third-telco.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"A ""Shabulized"" Naga City? Inquirer corrects fake News with fake News","Leni Robredo spokesperson Barry Gutierrez, who called a critic's claim ""ridiculous"", just made an even more ridiculous claim... and the Inquirer fell for it hook, line, and sinker. 

Maastricht University International Relations teacher Sass Sasot [Maastricht] yesterday called everyone's attention to a supposed Fake News article published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer [Sasot].

The article, entitled ""Lenis camp scorns claim Jesses brod into drugs"" and written by a certain Melvin Gascon, attempted to debunk former Naga City councilor Luis Ortega's claim supporting President Rodrigo Duterte's pronouncement that Naga is a ""hotbed for shabu"".

An archived copy of the article, saved on 23 August 2018 can be found by clicking here.
Sasot specifically quoted the part of the article where Vice-President Leni Robredo's spokeperson Ibarra ""Barry"" Guttierez attempted to discredit Ortega by citing the latter's supposedly multiple losses to the late mayor, essentially suggesting that Ortega harbors some bitterness against the late mayor. 

The said part reads:
""This was not the first time that Ortega came out with such 'ridiculous' claims, Gutierrez said of the former councilor who lost to six-term Naga City Mayor Jesse Robredo in the 2010, 2013 and 2016 elections.""
The problem with Gutierrez's claim -- a claim that Inquirer reporter Gascon wittingly or unwittingly failed to verify -- is that Jesse Robredo died in 2012 so he could not have possibly run in 2013 and 2016.

Isn't it ironic that Leni spokesperson Gutierrez, who called Ortega's claims ""ridiculous"", just made an even more ridiculous claim?

Inquirer ""corrects"" article
In an attempt to rectify the mistake, the Inquirer edited the article so that it now reads:
""This was not the first time that Ortega came out with such 'ridiculous' claims, Gutierrez said of the former councilor who lost to six-term Naga City Mayor Jesse Robredo in the 2010 elections.""
The Inquirer basically deleted 2013 and 2016, leaving 2010 behind, presumably because the Jesse Robredo was still alive then.

An archived copy of the revised article, saved on 24 August 2018, can be found by clicking here.

The problem, however, is that Jesse Robredo DID NOT RUN for Naga City mayor in 2010 because he reached his second three-term limit in 2010 after being mayor since 2001. The three candidates for Naga City's mayoral seat in 2010 were:
John Bongat (LP)
Jun Pelayo (IND), and,
Luis Ortega (IND). 
Ano ba yan? Itinama na pero mali pa rin.

A Comedy of Errors
With these said, I see at least two major issues here:

FIRST, Robredo spokesperson and Akbayan lawyer Barry Gutierrez doesn't know what he's talking about. I agree with Sasots observation that Gutierrezs blunder bolstered whistleblower ex-councilor Luis Ortega's credibility.

Surely, if Leni felt seriously insulted by Duterte after the latter called Naga a shabu ""hotbed"" [RMN], then she should be even more enraged by his spokesperson's ignorance about an issue that hits so close to home.

Oh, wait! IT HITS HER HOME, actually.


SECOND, Gascon and the Inquirer may need to take a refresher course on journalism because they failed miserably in this article. These are the people who love being called ""legit journalists"", but their work suggests otherwise.

That is, while its true that Gutierrez claimed that Ortega lost to Robredo in 2010, 2013, 2016, its also true that Gutierrezs claims are false... and thats what the Inquirer miserably failed to point out.

In the oft-cited book ""The Elements of Journalism,"" Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel wrote that journalism is a discipline of verification. [DailySabah]

Now, where is the verification in the Inquirer article? Can a journalist be called a journalist if the essence of his job, i.e. verifying claims before publishing, is missing?

University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication dean Luis Teodoro once wrote [Teodoro]:
""The media shouldnt just report everything every idiot, crook and liar says without subjecting it to critical assessment. Theres a name for that. Its called 'he said, she said reporting'. Its stenography, not journalism.""
Well, I guess this Inquirer reporter Gascon is not a journalist, but a stenographer.

Photos show Robredo revisor chillaxes with SC PET employees in Pansol Resort,"Highly-placed sources provided photos and information showing Robredos revisor for the vice-presidential electoral protest went with at least twenty other Supreme Court-Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) employees for an outing in a Laguna resort last month.

UPDATE 1 (12:42 PM. 09 Jul 2018): The writer just found out that in line with this development, the Marcos camp filed a ""MANIFESTATION OF GRAVE CONCERN with EXTREMELY URGENT MOTION TO INVESTIGATE"" this morning at the Supreme Court [GMANews].

PET revisors are Supreme Court employees tasked with verifying the contents of the ballot boxes involved in the recount in line with the VP electoral protest lodged by former Senator Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos against Vice-president Leni Robredo.

Marcos and Robredo are allowed to appoint their own revisors to oversee the recount.
Screenshots from a Facebook post of a certain Che Che, who the source identified as PET Head Revisor Maria Katrin Rosales, showed at least 21 different individuals who were identified by the source as PET employees plus Robredos personal revisor in an outing in a resort in Pansol, Laguna.

The source said the outing took place on 22 June 2018.

(NOTE: The source said Rosales' posts were already deleted, but only after they have already been screen-capped by third parties including the source.)

It is illegal for PET employees to socialize and make friends with any party to a pending PET case.

Second source named names
Rosales uploaded a large number pictures and another highly-placed source, who also independently managed to download copies of the photos, managed to identify the persons in the said photos:















The second source identified the following as participants in the outing, based on the Facebook photos posted by PET Head Revisor Rosales:

Osmundo Abuyuan - Leni's Revisor
Hazel Magsipoc - PET Head Revisor
Mohammad Disomangcop - PET Head Revisor
Christine Enriquez - PET Head Revisor
Jennifer Pablo - PET Head Revisor
Julius Tumalad -  Alternate Head Revisor
Noriesel Lalamunan - PET Head Revisor
Irene Canada - PET Head Revisor
Princess Bonetivo - PET Head Revisor
Hannah Medrano - PET Head Revisor

Ellaine Francisco - PET Appraiser
Keno Moraleda - Head PET Custodian
Martin Santos - PET Custodian
Edward Roque - PET Custodian
Bryan Puntero - PET Custodian
Elijah Mikaelson - PET Custodian
Rogene Agudelo - PET Custodian
Mel Darien Buensalido - PET Custodian
Reycard Castro - PET Chief Tabulator
Michaer Rebosura - PET Head Revisor

Third source identifies the resort
A third highly-placed source who was given access to resort records said the outing took place at a place named ""3J's Resort"" in Pansol Heights Subdivision, Pansol, Calamba, Laguna. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: The source said the resort and its owners had no idea about the working relationship of the abovementioned guests so ThinkingPinoy hopes that the reader will bear no ill will against the establishment, its employees, or its owners. Actually, ThinkingPinoy may actually book that place for a family outing in the future.

The source provided a photo of the resort's calendar:


The photo shows a certain ""Mel Darien"" booked the property from 7:00 pm Friday, 22 June 2018, to 5:00 PM Saturday, 23 June 2018, i.e. an overnight stay.
The source identified this Mel Darien as PET Ballot Box Custodian Mel Darien Buensalido.

Based on this data, the seemingly inappropriate and quite lengthy outing indeed transpired in Pansol, Laguna.


Why does this matter?
The Code of Conduct for Court Personnel [A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC] prohibits ""any act of impropriety that immeasurably affects... the peoples confidence in [the Judiciary]"". Per Burgos v. Aquino [A.M. No. P-94-1081], this must include the behavior of court personnel as private individuals.

Clearly visible in almost all of the photos was Osmundo Ritchie Abuyuan, one of the revisors of Leni Robredo. Surely, a Robredo revisor being too chummy with PET employees in an out-of-town escapade erodes that confidence. 

After all, how can we trust PET personnel to be fair in recounting the ballots when they're too friendly with one of the parties?


Here's a fair and honest question: 
Is this seemingly overly close relationship between PET personnel and the Robredo Camp the reason why the PET revisors are TAKING SO DAMN LONG to count just one province?",RJ Nieto,"July 9, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/07/photos-show-robredo-revisor-chillaxes.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Is Health Sec. Duque doing an Ombudsman Carpio-Morales?,"Heres why I believe Health Secretary Francisco Duque must go.

In May 2018, Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque suddenly became a very vocal critic of his predecessor Janet Garin when he accused the latter of complicity in an 8.1-billion-peso school-based health center scam that Duque himself claimed to have discovered.

The news is shocking at first glance, but a little research shows that Duque is not telling everyone everything, and thats what well talk about. In this article, I will show you that Duque appears to be using the same strategy that our current Aquino-appointee Ombudsman is using.


What did Conchita do?
The July 2017 ThinkingPinoy article Conchita's Trojan Horse: Weak Mamasapano cases to provide PNoy immunity? detailed how Aquino-appointee Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales downgraded charges against the former president when she indicted Aquino only for usurpation of authority instead of homicide for the death of the 44 SAF troopers in Mamasapano, even if there is sufficient evidence to prove the latter, more serious offense.

Zooming forward to June 2018, Carpio-Morales again downgraded charges against PNoy in connection with multi-billion-peso Disbursement Acceleration Program scam when she merely indicted the latter with usurpation of legislative powers, an offense thats punishable by only up to 6 years in prison.
Aquino and his cohorts have committed so many other wrongdoings during the past administration, but Carpio-Morales turned a blind eye on them.

I will not discuss these anymore because I think I have sufficiently illustrated that Carpio-Morales used her authority as the Ombudsman to protect her ally Aquino at the expense of Public Interest.

And Duque appears to be doing the same right now.

But first, lets learn a little bit more about Health Secretary Francisco Duque.


Who is Francisco Duque?
Lets list down the various major government positions that Health Secretary Francisco Duque held over the past couple of decades:
President and CEO of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) from 2001 to 2004. 
Secretary of Health from 2005 to 2009
Chairman of the Civil Service Commission from 2010 to 2015
Consultant to Health Secretary Janet Garin from 2015 to 2016
GSIS Chairman in 2017
Secretary of Health (again) from 2017 to present
Duque, by all means, is a political survivor in that he managed to stay in power through appointive positions in three consecutive administrations: that of PGMA, PNOY, and PRRD.

And we all know meritocracy is rare, if not nearly non-existent, in Philippine Government.

Duque is a survivor.

Duque and Dengvaxia
Current Health Secretary Francisco Duques first major challenge was the Dengvaxia Scandal that erupted on 30 November 2017, after manufacturer Sanofi admitted a major drug defect that affects a significant but unknown number of vaccine recipients in the Philippines.

Instead of siding with the over 800,000 Filipino victims as expected from a public servant, Duque took an underhanded approach by not-so-subtly defending the vaccine when he said [MB]:

For those who were not previously infected by the dengue virus, the analysis found that vaccination led to a benefit in preventing severe illness for at least 30 months. In the longer term, severe cases may occur following a subsequent dengue infection among those who were not previously infected.
The problem here? The 30-month protective period isnt back by sufficient empirical data, for the simple reason that the vaccine has not been in the mass market long enough to demonstrate such a protective period.

The protective period is interpolated at best, or completely hypothetical at worst. For example, the 63 bodies autopsied by the Public Attorney Office all passed away less than 30 months after their last Dengvaxia dose.

This is not to say that the supposed protective period is entirely fictional, but why would a Secretary of Health, instead of advocating for the victims, defend Big Pharma instead?


Duque not defending Big Pharma?
A deeper look shows that that Duque is not trying to save Big Pharma: hes instead trying to save his own ass.

Duque was appointed to the Department of Health on 26 October 2017 [CNNph] to replace Paulyn Ubial, who was rejected by the Commission on Appointments.
That is, the botched Dengvaxia program still went on for a full month into Duques incumbency as Health Secretary despite:
The Dengvaxia Mass Immunization Program is already controversial within the Healthcare Community even before it was rolled out in April 2016.
There have been several attempts to halt its implementation, with Secretary Paulyn Ubial leading the charge.
The primary reason for Ubials CA rejection is her opposition to the Dengvaxia program.
And the primary reason why he got the DoH portfolio is Ubials rejection.
With these said, how in the world can Duque be so oblivious about the Dengvaxia issue, when the fact of the matter is that its the primary catalyst of his appointment to the Department of Health?

Again, political survival.


Duque and the Commission on Appointments
I initially tried to give Secretary Duque the benefit of the doubt because he was still up for CA confirmation at the time the Dengvaxia scandal broke. Well, I guess his strategy worked because his defense of the Sanofi and his aversion to attributing blame to the Aquino Administration easily earned him a CA nod in early February, with no less than Aquino ally Senator Risa Hontiveros advocating for his confirmation.

Again, I am not saying that hes an Aquino ally. Instead, Im saying that hes a traditional politician whose primary goal is his own political survival.

After his CA confirmation, I expected Duque to take a tougher stance on the Dengvaxia Issue because there is virtually no risk of him losing his DoH post.


However, it has been four months since his confirmation and not even a single Department of Health official has been put under preventive suspension, a non-punitive measure that would have helped keep officials from unduly influencing the Dengvaxia investigations.

This is despite the fact that 99% of officials in the Health Department are holdovers from the past administration.


For example, Assistant Secretary Lyndon Lee-Suy, who is a pro-Dengvaxia advocate and has been in the department since the Aquino-era, is still freely roaming inside the Department of Health.

Instead of acknowledging this shortcoming, Duque had the gall to tell the public that disease outbreaks are possible because people complain about Dengvaxia [GMA].


Wheres Duques Logic?
At this point, many Filipinos are wont to think that Duque has lost his mind. My reading, however, is that his actions post-confirmation still makes a lot of sense with respect to his personal interest of political survival.

Duque is hedging. Hedging is a strategy to reduce risk by betting on two or more things at the same time instead of just one.

In this case, Duque is already confirmed and, despite his astounding incompetence, is still within the good graces of President Duterte. As far as I can see, Duterte will not replace him because the president himself said he fires people only on the grounds of corruption. That is, as long as Duque displays only incompetence and not corruption, he should be fine, just like most of the Presidents communications team.

Duques primary concern, however, is what happens to him AFTER Duterte. He has been in appointive positions since 2001 and he has survived up to now. Now, what will help ensure his appointment to some juicy position in 2022 after Duterte steps down and somebody else takes over?

What if the opposition somehow snags the Presidency? For one, Dutertes assassination is not impossible as the President himself floated the possibility when he said in April 2018 [AJ]:

At least, if ever my airplane explodes, or if some roadside bomb explodes, maybe you can ask the CIA.

In short, Duques defense of Dengvaxia is Duques defense of the past administration, which is currently the political opposition, whose nominal chairman is Vice President Leni Robredo.

And I think its reasonable to say that as Bongbong Marcoss electoral protest reaches the finish line, the risk of a presidential assassination goes higher and higher.

And Duque, the political survivor, wants to survive a regime change.


Duque found a hairy ball
But to everyones surprise, Duque in late May 2018 went to the media with guns blazing, squarely blaming Garin for the multi-billion peso school-based health center scam. Many were impressed, but I wasnt.

You see, the health center scam has already been reported on 25 December 2017 in the ThinkingPinoy article #DengGate: Garins P4.8-billion botched, overpriced Health Center Project. The article gained over a million reads and over 56,000 shares on Facebook alone.

Duque cannot claim to have no knowledge of that article because Duque himself went ballistic in a January 2018 PhilHealth Board Meeting when he said nobody should release PhilHealth documents to the public. Philhealth Insiders told me it was in direct reference to my article, which was replete with documents that could have been obtained only by PhilHealth employees.

Duque went on radio silence about the issue until the last several days of May 2018, when he apparently found the balls to take Garin head on.

But a bit of investigation shows that Duque, again, is hedging.

A highly-placed and unassailable source from the Department of Health informed me that only P1.2 of the P8.1-billion has been paid to the contractor as part of the mobilization costs. Mobilization costs are like the down payment that allows a contractor to commence with the project.

Meanwhile, the rest of the funds, amounting to P6.9 billion, is safely deposited in the Department of Healths savings account at the Land Bank of the Philippines.

How Duque is doing a Carpio-Morales
Garin is faced with two major high-profile issues right now:

1. The Dengvaxia Scandal, which has been the subject of Senate Blue Ribbon Hearings. This scandal is deeply intertwined with the P10.6-billion PhilHealth Fund Scandal that was extensively outlined in ""#DengGate: Dear Mr. President, heres the memo you asked for""

2. The School-based Health Center Scandal, which will be subject to a new set of Senate Blue Ribbon Hearings chaired by Senator Gordon. This scandal is deeply intertwined with the P10.6-billion PhilHealth Fund Scandal that was extensively discussed in ""#DengGate: PNoy, Garin, Abad, Padilla almost bankrupted PhilHealth"".

As explained in Garins P4.8-billion botched, overpriced Health Center Project, the contract involved, while highly irregular, does not show direct traces of Garins exertion of undue influence for personal gain.

This is in stark contrast to the Dengvaxia Scandal, where Garin connived with several DoH officials to bend the rules, negotiate with Sanofi, and actively influence the government to buy the experimental anti-Dengue vaccine. This has been extensively discussed in the article Leaked emails show Pnoy, Garin, Hartigan-Go intentionally bent rules for Sanofi.

In short, Garin will most likely be indicted for the relatively minor crime of technical malversation for the Health Center Scam, as opposed to a potential plunder case stemming from the Dengvaxia Scam.

That is, Duque is hedging: he is grilling Garin for a lesser offense. He is effectively diverting public attention from the Dengvaxia issue where theres already a preponderance of evidence, to a health center issue where Garin could only get a slap on the wrist at worst.

So it appears that Duques attack on Garin does not only make Duque look good in the administrations eyes, but also to Garins because it shifts the attention away from the Dengvaxia issue.

Whys Duque doing this again? Political survival.

And that is how Francisco is doing a Conchita.

And that, my friends, is the hallmark of a traditional politician. TraPos sometimes bend to public opinion, but Duque relies on appointments and not on elective posts. Hence, negative public opinion matters less to him, as he stays in power as long as hes ok with the sitting president.

Faced with the biggest Public Health Crisis in recent history, with 64 deaths and counting, do we need a Health Secretary whose primary goal is Political Survival and not Public Safety?

I do not think so.

Akbayan-LP's impeach plan vs 8 pro-QW SC Justices will increase Duterte's Power,"Senator Risa Hontiveros' Akbayan Partylist will be filing, through its Rep. Tom Villarin,  impeachment cases against the eight associate justices who voted in favor of the the Quo Warranto Petition against Atty. Lourdes Sereno.

I'll tell you how it will backfire GLORIOUSLY.

We are talking about same Tom Villarin who served as Mar Roxas' right-hand guy during the latter's DILG stint. He also allegedly masterminded the #NasaanAngPangulo PR campaign, which attempted to pin all the blame over the Mamasapano Massacre to President Noynoy Aquino in order to protect Roxas' presidential ambitions.

The eight justices who voted in favor of the Quo Warranto Petition are:
Associate Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro
Associate Justice Francis Jardeleza
Associate Justice Andres Reyes
Associate Justice Alexander Gesmundo
Associate Justice Diosdado Peralta
Associate Justice Samuel Martires
Associate Justice Lucas Bersamin
Associate Justice Noel Tijam
Assuming that the 8 cases somehow magically hurdle the House of Representatives of the Philippines and all the justices somehow got convicted, then what we'll have is a VERY HILARIOUS SITUATION, at that would imply the following:
FIRST and most obviously,  Duterte still chooses the prospective replacements.
A Supreme Court dominated by Duterte appointees, instead of happening in Q4 2019 or Q1 2020, may happen earlier because it's Pres. Rody Duterte who'll appoint their replacements.

That's so sad... for the Opposition.


SECOND, the dates of mandatory retirement aren't favorable to Villarin's plans.
Leonardo - De Castro will retire in 2018; 
Martires, Tijam, Jardeleza, Bersamin in 2019; 
Reyes in 2020; 
Peralta in March 2022; and;
Gesmundo in 2026. 
That is, the first six mentioned are about to retire anyway, as the first five may even retire prior to the conclusion of their corresponding impeachment trial, forcing the Senate to dismiss their cases for being moot and academic. In short, in as far as the composition of the SC is concerned, there's isn't much to fear vis-a-vis Akbayan's drama.
THIRD, Gesmundo's removal still means Duterte chooses his replacement. 
Unless Akbayan has some intricate strategy to manipulate the JBC nomination process (something similar to, say, Sereno's clustering system), then Villarin's plan is but an exercise in futility because again, Duterte will appoint the prospective replacements.

FOURTH, Removing Peralta means more Duterte SC appointees. 
Removing Peralta, meanwhile, will simply add to the number of Duterte appointees in the Supreme Court. It has already been anticipated in June 2016 and before Sereno's disqualification that based on the AJ's respective dates of retirement (they're required by law to retire at 70), there would be 10 Duterte appointees in 4Q 2019 and presumably beyond.

With Sereno's disqualification, there would be 11 Duterte appointees instead of 10.

Now, Peralta is supposed to retire March 2022 so a replacement may be considered an illegal midnight appointment. With a Peralta impeachment plus conviction, however, Peralta will leave the SC sooner so Duterte will be appointing 12... and there are only 15 justices in the SC.

Let's sum it up
IF VILLARIN'S IMPEACHMENT PLANS COMPLETELY PROSPER, THEN 12 OUT OF 15 SC JUSTICES WILL BE DUTERTE APPOINTEES, INSTEAD OF JUST 10.

The only ones that will be left in the current Supreme Court would be Associate Justices Marvic Leonen, Estela Perlas-Bernabe, and Benjamin Caguioa, all Aquino appointees. Note that Perlas-Bernabe is not an Aquino lapdog. She writes sober and logical decisions, so Akbayan and its overlord the Liberal Party cannot always rely on her.

And that's how Akbayan-LP's plan will gloriously backfire. Akbayan-LP's plan is poorly thought of and ill-advised, but I have always been aware that intelligence isn't exactly Akbayan-LP's strongest suit.

I mean, just look at their poster girl Senator Risa Hontiveros.",RJ Nieto,"May 17, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/05/akbayan-lps-impeach-plan-vs-8-pro-qw-sc.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Several pleasant surprises that kinda restored my Faith in Humanity,"Here's a rare feel-good ThinkingPinoyarticle. 


I attended the 20th Anniversary of Children's Joy Foundation, Inc. (CJFI), a shelter for children whose parents, in one way or another, cannot take care of their kids.

It's the same children's shelter that's helping the kid who was latched onto my leg to show his gratitude for the time I shared with him when I visited CJFI in 2016. The kid's mom has a mental issue while the dad was a victim of 2012's Typhoon Pablo. Pablo's strong winds blew away a roof and part of it hit the dad's stomach. The father, while now stable, is still healing from his wounds.
But I'm digressing.

I told one of the CJFI administrators that I am really happy that they are helping these kids. If left alone, these kids would only be dreaming to survive for another day.

With the shelter's help, however, they gain the freedom to dream bigger, to become professional adults who can compete with those who had way better opportunities than they had.

It was a very happy event, as I discovered that CJFI wards from years back , who were so poor and helpless when they were still kids, have now become lawyers, accountants, teachers... they have become competent professionals who actually have a pretty good fighting chance in life.

I know the foundation helped them get through childhood, but I didn't know that they turned into magna cum laude graduates and CPA-Lawyers and Litigation Lawyers and whatnot.

I even told one of the administrators, ""Wow, these kids who had so much less than I had when I was a kid are now far more accomplished than I am! Maybe you should adopt me at CGFI too! ""

Pastor Apollo Quiboloy founded CJFI. You can say what you want about him, but he's helping so many helpless kids not only in Mindanao but also around the world. 

Did you know that they even built a school in Kenya that doubles as an amusement park? The pastor said he found kids from a Kenyan squatter colony who were using a shanty as a classroom, so he rented a building for them. 

I may write a separate piece about the oft-misunderstood man. Meanwhile, let's talk about someone I met in the event.

Bumping into former NorthRail board member Isko Moreno
One of the guests in the event was Department of Social Welfare and Development Undersecretary Francisco ""Isko Moreno"" Domagoso and I bumped into him while I was at the hotel lobby.

The ensuing conversation was fascinating, to say the least.

I asked him why he resigned from NorthRail just three months into his appointment.

I've heard rumors that the government-owned and -controlled corporation NorthRail is rife with corruption, so I can't help but give credence to the other rumor that he resigned from NorthRail because of what Pres.Rody Duterte calls ""whiff of corruption"".

His answer surprised me.

FIRST, he didn't disparage NorthRail. While I would've preferred that he dished out some juicy tidbits about the inner workings of this GOCC, I commend the undersecretary for his professionalism as he refrained from badmouthing what could be considered as his ""former employer"".

You see, HR professionals generally dislike applicants who openly lambast their former companies too much.
SECOND, he honestly said that he's not a very technical guy. He outrightly told me that he's no expert in finance and engineering. Afterwards and to my surprise, he said he resigned that early because he felt that the president should appoint someone who's more suited to the job than him because Filipinos deserve the best Public Service.

Well, I am talking to a relatively seasoned politician so I am not certain if he's just pulling my leg, but what he said is actually true and he speaks with an uncanny air of authenticity. I've spoken to a lot of politicians over the past couple of years, and I think I'm pretty good at judging when someone is lying.

I believe he wasn't. Moreover, the fact that the president appointed him to a higher position in a cabinet department is evidence enough for me to give him the benefit of the doubt.

DSWD Usec. Isko Moreno
And that leads us to the next question: I asked the undersecretary why he accepted the DSWD appointment.

He said helping the less fortunate has always been part of his advocacies. Well, there's nothing really surprising about that, as any politician would say the same.

What said next, however, suprised me again.

He said he lived in a squatter colony in Tondo, Manila for 18 years before he became an actor. He said he has experienced and endured similar, if not drastically worse, hardships that DSWD beneficiaries face.

He said an ideal DSWD official must have a deep understanding of the suffering of the poor, so that he can deliver the best service regardless of the challenges he'll face. He said understanding suffering cannot simply be taught in school: one has to experience it, feel it, see it.

And he experienced, felt, and seen suffering first hand, for 18 years, so he thinks that his appointment to DSWD is not just a responsibility, but a blessing.

Isko and his speech
So we went back to the conference hall to watch the ceremonies, where there was a series of speakers. I spoke first and he was scheduled to speak last.

During his turn to speak, he nonchalantly said he has a prepared English speech, but he's really bad in English so he'd rather deliver an impromptu speech in Tagalog.

That kind of self-deprecating honesty is rare in politicians, whose egos typically fill the Araneta Coliseum.

He pleasantly surprised me again.
He delivered an impromptu speech, in plain and fluent Tagalog, and I can confidently say that I can't speak Tagalog as well as he does, as effectively as he does.

There was a part where he said:
""Huwag kang umasang may mangyayaring kakaiba bukas kung ang ginawa mo ngayon ay katulad ng kahapon.""
TRANSLATION: ""Don't hope that something new will happen tomorrow if what you did today is the same as yesterday."".

I know that the idea is not exactly original, but his surprisingly poetic wording is. I tried to google that exact Tagalog sentence and I can't find anything.

Yeah, he came up with it himself.

Time to go home
Then it was time to go home, and I bumped into him again at the hotel lobby. This time, he was with his teenage son. He said his son tagged along and watched the CJFI Anniversary Ceremonies too.

I asked him why he brought his son there and how his son managed to evade death from boredom.
He said he lived a tough life, but his son didn't. He said his son is very privileged. For that reason, he brings the kid to events like these so the child can learn about the lives of real Filipino kids who don't have a wealthy celebrity dad.

He said he doesn't want his son to suffer the same things he went through, but he also doesn't want him to be oblivious of the reality on the ground, and that's why the teen tagged along tonight.

And he said all these with a body language that does not, in any way, suggest deceit. Either he's a incredibly good liar, or he's just plain and brutally authentic.Judging from tonight's conversations, I feel that it's the latter.

I like this Isko guy a lot, so far.

And no, this not a paid post. I wrote this because I felt the need to tell it.

Imagining a post-2022 Malacaang,"I am confident that President Rody Duterte will remain to be massively popular until his term ends. However, at the rate things are going, I regretfully predict that his international reputation in the West will be in tatters, given the Liberal Party's ""excellent"" working relationship with Western media and academia, thanks to its access to a massive international NGO network. Adding the fact that there's virtually no international counter-propaganda coming from the administration makes it all the worse.

We're almost midway through 2018, and I have doubts on whether there's enough time to implement charter change. The President himself said in December the Nation may not be ready for Federalism, saying it is not resonating in the Visayas and Mindanao. He also said Congress is apparently unwilling to make concessions so the Federal Constitution's development appears to be on a deadlock [Star].

While I seriously hope that Federalism pushes through, let us, for the meanwhile, consider a scenario where we're still under the unedited 1987 Constitution. That is, lets assume that there'll be a 2022 Presidential Elections.


The 2022 Presidential Elections
I have reason to believe that the 2022 Presidential Elections will be fiercer than 2016's. I expect international political groups to channel massive funds to help the LP candidate win. While the Omnibus Election Code prohibits foreign funding, there are many very creative ways to get around this rule.

Just look at VP Leni Robredo, who received foreign funding during her 2013 Congressional Run [MT]. The case is still pending in the COMELEC, and its a gigantic enigma why it has been ""parked for so long. Is there practically no way she can be acquitted?


But were digressing. Lets get back to the 2022 Elections.
In preparation for 2022, LP's perfect ""Sales Pitch"" could be ""Help us prevent another Duterte!!!"". Again, at the rate things are going, I'm pretty sure that the slogan will sell well among moneyed Westerners.

But then, I highly doubt though that any LP candidate will be popular enough locally to actually win the Presidency fair and square. But you know, LP has a track record of extreme creativity. 

Remember Mar Roxas' futile attempt at persuading fellow presidential candidate Grace Poe to back out two days before the 2016 polls? Remember what has been happening in the VP electoral protest? The list goes on and on.

The Proto-Presidentiables

At the moment, I can see three potential presidentiables:

FIRST, Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Duterte.
Inday Sara is a reluctant candidate. In a recent sortie in Macau, she said in a speech that she can't bear being away from her little kids so she wont run for Senate and House in 2019. However, I think there's a slight possibility that she will run in 2022.

I was there in the venue, watching her speech, and I cheekily interrupted her when I said her kids would already be a bit grown up by 2022. Afterwards, I immediately asked her if she could run for President by then. She said, ""Let's see.""

I do not want to make too much out of it, but there's a bit of a possibility there. If President Duterte manages to stay massively popular until then, Inday may become a shoo-in successor because the people will likely want continuity.

The challenge, however, would be for her father to REMAIN EXTREMELY POPULAR nationwide. Though I personally think its unlikely, a massive drop in the Presidents trust and satisfaction ratings in the last couple of years of his term could dash Indays chances.

Lastly, it's also important to forecast how many Duterte supporters will support a BBM presidency, i.e. the number that will not vote for Inday. Will Duterte's support base increase over the years that he's president? Only time will tell.

SECOND, former Senator Bongbong Marcos. 
Despite not holding a cabinet position that wouldve helped him pave the way for a potential 2022 run, the former senator amazingly manages to stay relevant to the public through his electoral protest, currently being (mis)handled(?) by the Supreme Court, sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal.

So far, Marcos has managed to paint himself as the underdog in the protest. Truth be told, the major delays, the wet and burned ballots, the missing audit logs, and so much more really does make him appear to be the underdog in the Public Eye.

And you know, everybody loves underdogs.

Truth be told, the outcome of the protest has become immaterial. If he wins, then his camp and his supporters are happy, and he gains a valuable launching pad for 2022, i.e. the Vice-presidency. If he loses or if the case never gets resolved, he will be seen as the rightful vice-president who was cheated by the Liberal Party Machinery, giving his supporters major incentive to catapult him to the presidency.

The challenge to BBM's potential 2022 run is how he would expand his support base. Remember that while he received 14 million votes in 2016, many Marcos Loyalists are already of advanced age. That is, BBM has to find a way to appeal to the younger generation and possibly, find new allies who can help him get significant numbers of votes.

I guess it's one of the reasons why the Liberal Party, that has a sworn hatred for the Marcoses, actively does rounds in colleges and high schools: so that they can capture BBM's much-needed audience before BBM does.

Who shall I pick among the two?
Obviously, many of you will ask me who I would vote for. I will not answer that. 

This is more of a thought experiment that should not be construed as pitting one camp against the other, a proclivity that a few supporters from both camps seemingly possess.

For all we know, both may not even run at all. Anything is possible, especially in light of the past two presidential elections, where runaway candidates won: Aquino via the sympathy vote because his mom died, and Duterte, via an unconventional campaign that captured the hearts and minds of millions, blitzkrieg-style.

Thus, theres no point in fighting right now over who deserves what: theres still four years left in Dutertes Presidency and we dont even know if he will last that long. For one, he even said in a closed-door meeting with journalists earlier this year that if he dies, its because of the CIA.

But I haven't mentioned the third presidentiable yet.

Third, Senator Bam Aquino.
As you may very well notice, I completely ignored the possibility that Vice-president Leni Robredo will attempt an upgrade. You see, I have reason to believe that there may be some significant LP factions that will oppose her candidacy.

Why? She has a proven track record of idiocy. She categorically is a dimwit. Besides, Robredo isnt exactly very popular either, with her popularity ratings sharing the same level as VP Jojo Binays last two years in office, as shown in the image below.

Leni's Satisfaction Ratings in her first two years closely match Binay's ratings when the latter was already under heavy attack by the administration via the Makati Parking Building Scandal, among others. 

Unless Robredo somehow finds a way to raise both her IQ and EQ by 50 points each over the next several months, I do not see how she can possibly become a viable opposition candidate for the 2022 presidency.
Lets go back to Bam, who faces significant challenges.

Bam Aquino is ranked 10-19 in the latest Senatorial Survey [Star]. If hes not even popular enough to definitively get into the Senates Top 12, how in the world will he win the Presidency, which requires so much more? 

In all honesty, I can see no other viable candidate among LP's ranks at the moment. That is, even if Bam may have a very slim chance at winning, he will still be forced to run because it would be thoroughly humiliating for LP to fail to field a candidate in a presidential race.

But then, I do not really know how Bam will reinvent himself to make him more likeable. Well, that's his problem. But I guess he no other choice but to try.

The 2022 Campaign
Barring the last-minute entry of another strong candidate, lets imagine a scenario with Bam, BBM, and Inday.

Theres the problem of a potential head-to-head between BBM and Inday, which could split the votes of Duterte supporters, thereby opening the possibility of another Aquino Presidency. However, if Bam remains to be as unpopular as he is today, I doubt that itll happen. More so if he loses his 2019 re-election bid, which would deprive him of a major platform to stay relevant until 2022.

Now, assuming that Bam somehow gains a considerable level of popularity, then the possibility of Bam ending up as the runaway winner in BBM-Bam-Inday three-way becomes a significant possibility. With that said, one of the administration candidates may need to back out.

Inday, I think, is the most reluctant presidentiable. While I am not exactly privy to how she personally views the Marcoses, I think that her profound dislike for the yellows, along with the calling of family life, may be enough for her to back down. But then, Inday is notoriously incorrigible: after she has made up her mind, thats it.

On the other hand, I think that the Marcoses are on some sort of quest for redemption. After being demonized for over three decades, whether justified or not, they appear to be hell-bent on redeeming their family name. I believe BBM has his eyes on 2022 and I have serious doubts that he would back down.

Bongbong is already 60 years old today, so hell be 65 by 2022. If he backs down, the next chance would be in 2028, i.e. when hes 71. Moreover, many Marcos loyalists are already old, so theres a risk that he may lose a large chunk of his support base if he defers his presidential ambitions.

But if BBM somehow decides that he can still defer his candidacy, then thats it. After all, I do not know everything thats in BBMs mind.

Will it be Inday vs Bam, BBM vs Bam, Inday vs Bam vs BBM... or even Inday vs BBM?

Your guess is as good as mine.


Challenges for the winner
If Bam Aquino wins...
... then God Help Us.

If Bongbong Marcos wins...
...then he should expect an opposition that would be fiercer than the opposition that Pres. Duterte is facing today. Moreover, he will almost always be described as the ""spitting image of his father, the Former Dictator..."" and so on and so forth. 

However, I think BBM understands propaganda and counter-propaganda way better than the current administration, so there's a pretty good chance that he'll be able to handle it. I think his team has learned from both from recent and the not-so-distant past to know how to handle these things.

If Inday Sara Duterte wins...
...then it will be her task to refurbish our image in the West. Inday is far more reserved and genteel than her father, and those qualities may help her accomplish the task. 

Another challenge would be the depth of her bench, similar to her father's conundrum when he won in 2016. President Duterte knows and trust a very limited number of people so that completing his cabinet in time for his oath-taking was an arduous task. But it's also possible that she'll know and trust more people over the next four years.


But then again, remember that this is just a thought experiment. For all we know, some mayor from some far-flung city will suddenly surface in 2021 and capture the hearts and minds of millions of Filipinos, just like what Rodrigo Duterte did.

However, I sincerely doubt that there will be another Rodrigo Duterte: hes in a league of his own.",RJ Nieto,"April 27, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/04/imagining-post-2022-malacanang.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: How I would argue Calidas Quo Warranto vs Sereno,"Several camps, including the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), are gunning for the dismissal of SolGen Calida's Quo Warranto petition against Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno, arguing that impeachment is the only constitutional means of removing impeachable officials.

I think this is incorrect and let me explain why.
DISCLAIMER: These is my personal opinion regarding the case. Should there be legal infirmities in my explanations, I strongly encourage the reader to point them out in the comments section of the ThinkingPinoy Facebook Page or to email me at TP@ThinkingPinoy.net . Also note that I am already exhausted so I have no more energy to proofread my work.
Lets go.



First, the meaning of Removal
A Justice in the Supreme Court of the Philippines explained to me the nature of Calida's petition and I published it in a previous Thinking Pinoy article.

In that article, the Justice said SolGen Calida's Quo Warranto petition assails Sereno's qualifications at the time of her appointment as CJ in 2012. If granted, Calida's petition would render Sereno's appointment void ab initio, or void from the beginning.

That is, it will be as if Sereno was never Chief Justice. That is, it will be as if there wasn't any Chief Justice to remove because the Chief Justice's appointment -- Sereno's 2012 appointment -- would be considered invalid.
Strictly speaking, Serenos removal from office presupposes Serenos constitutional appointment as Chief Justice, a condition that wont exist if her appointment was invalid in the first place.

The Justice said this implies that Calida's petition progresses over a different track vis-a-vis impeachment. The Justice said this wont count as a collateral attack.

Collateral Attacks, in this regard, are non-impeachment petitions that would in effect remove Sereno through a process other than impeachment. But the operative word here is remove and as explained earlier, there is no CJ Sereno to remove because there was never a Chief Justice Sereno, just an Associate Justice Sereno, at best.

Second, what makes the Chief Justice more special than the Chief Executive?
Referring to the Calidas Quo Warranto petition, 1990 Bar Exam Topnotcher and Senator Koko Pimental said [Politiko]:
Kasi nga sa pagbasa natin sa constitutional provision [on impeachment,] ang message that we get is that the only way to remove these high-ranking government officials, who are so-called impeachable officials, is to impeach, di ba?
For the readers reference, Article XI, Sections 2 and 3, of the 1987 Constitution states:
Section 2. The President, the Vice-President, the Members of the Supreme Court, the Members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman may be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, or betrayal of public trust. All other public officers and employees may be removed from office as provided by law, but not by impeachment.
Section 3.  The House of Representatives shall have the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment.
Now, I think the following are clear based on Sections 2 and 3:
That impeachable officials may be removed via impeachment
That the power to impeach is reserved solely for Congress
With these said, Article XI didnt say that impeachment is the SOLE way to remove an impeachable official.
For example, suppose I said that I may entertain myself by watching a movie, that doesnt necessarily mean that movies are the only things that entertain me. For example, I may also entertain myself by reading Vice-president Leni Robredos legendary quotes, or by watching videos of Senator Leila de Limas public meltdowns, and neither of them qualify as watching a movie.


More specifically, part of Rule 14 of the 2010 Rules of Presidential Electoral Tribunal [A.M. No. 10-4-29-SC] states:
""An election contest is initiated by the filing of an election protest or a petition for quo warranto against the President or Vice-President.""
Thus, a quo warranto petition MAY BE FILED against a sitting president or vice-president, so what makes the Chief Justice so special?

The quo warranto method against impeachable executives is deemed constitutional via an A.M. or Administrative Matter, a document whipped up by the Supreme Court En Banc, so what prevents the Supreme Court En Banc from whipping up a similar A.M. that will apply to Supreme Court Justices?

I do not see any. That is, if a quo warranto petition may be filed against the President of the Philippines, then logic and the Equal Protection Clause essentially dictates that such a petition may also be filed against the Chief Justice.

UPDATE (23 Mar 2018, 530 AM) : 
A lawyer-reader pointed out that ""while the analogy of 'a president and vp being removable by quo warranto so why shouldnt the chief justice be' has merit in logic, strictly speaking it is outside the constitutional framing. The constitution establishes limits, and since we are such a statutory country, we are supposed to stay within the limits in applying the law.""
However, there is judicial precedent. The SC removed a COA commissioner by quo warranto when he was an impeachable officer. So while i dnt agree with the qw of cj from a purist point of view, the sc could just easily uphold itself on jurisprudence this time around. 

Third, on computing the prescriptive period

Prescriptive periods are time limits that set forth the maximum period of time after an event that legal proceedings based on that event may be initiated.

Rule 66, Sec. 11 of the Rules of Court states that Quo Warranto proceedings should commence within one  year after the entry of the judgment establishing the petitioners right to the office in question, so that Calidas Quo Warranto petition should have been filed no later than 2013, as Sereno was appointed Chief Justice in 2012.

That is, the prescriptive period for Quo Warranto Petitions is one year from date of appointment.
However, Act No. 3326 states that Prescription shall begin to run from the day of the commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceeding for its investigation and punishment.
UPDATE (23 Mar 2018, 530 AM) : 
A lawyer-reader pointed out that ""Act 3326 on prescription applies to only to special penal/criminal laws or for local criminal offenses. Not for special civil actions like quo warranto. And the specific prescriptive period in the rules for Quo Warranto trumps any other general provisions on prescription"".
Still, the petition ought to have been outright dismissed on grounds of prescription. SC is notoriously technical. But for them to give it due course says a lot about them really wanting the CJ booted out. Makes one wonder how one gets to be that undesirable, your own colleagues are tempted to stretch the limits of their discretion (already limitless and supreme in their case) to do so.
Sereno was presumed to have complied with all the requirements for nomination, let alone appointment, as Chief Justice. Moreover, it was only during the late 2017 Impeachment Hearings in the House of Representatives that the Solicitor General discovered that she failed to file SALNs, a crucial requirement for nomination as CJ.


In the absence of any 2012 document from the Judicial and Bar Council exempting Sereno from the requirement and considering that the infraction was discovered less than one year ago, I think Calidas petition will commence within the prescriptive period.

Imagine a hypothetical scenario where we found out that the Philippine President, who has been in position for over a year, is North Korean. Should the President be removed solely through impeachment because the prescriptive period is supposedly over? I do not think so.

Its interesting to note that Calidas Quo Warranto may end up nullifying Serenos CJ nomination, effectively nullifying President Aquinos appointment of Sereno because Serenos name should not have been in the shortlist to begin with.

Fourth, Caesar's wife must be above suspicion.
The saying means those in positions of authority should avoid even the implication of impropriety, and it has been a guiding principle for Supreme Court decisions in as early as 1974s Palang vs Zosa [GR No. L-38229], which states:
Like Caesar's wife, a judge must not only be pure but beyond suspicion.
In the 1997 administrative case Rabe vs Flores [A.M. No. P-97-1247], the Supreme Court dismissed court interpreter Delsa Flores because she failed to declare business interests in her SALN. The lowly court interpreter was dismissed because she failed to declare a specific business interest despite filing her SALN.

Surely, not filing ones SALN is an offense worse than underdeclarations in a SALN. Moreover, a Supreme Court Chief Justice must be subjected to higher standards than court interpreters.

With that said, how can Sereno  one of the highest-ranking officials in the Judiciary  get away with dishonesty while a lowly court interpreter cant?

I hope not, because that would be an injustice.

Fifth and finally, the Supreme Court as the Final Arbiter
Kabigting vs Director of Prisons [G.R. No. L-15548] states that ""...the Supreme Court, being the court of last resort, is the final arbiter of all legal questions..."", and that any legal issue related to the case shall be decided by the Supreme Court...

...and given that 8 out of 14 justices who shall decide on the Quo Warranto petition have testified against Sereno, I think the embattled Chief Justice's odds of winning the case is next to nil.

UPDATE (23 Mar 2018, 530 AM) :

For all we know, the Supreme Court may simply declare this case as an exception to rule, that the requirements, specifically on the prescription period, must be relaxed in the interest of justice, then declare this case as sui generis or one of its kind, so as not as not ""disrupt"" jurisprudence. After all the Associate Justices are the Gods of Faura.

If this happens, the question is whether such the Executive branch will recognized and enforced such a decision. But then, remember that the Solicitor General himself filed this petition, so I think that's very, very likely.

"Supreme Court Politics: Sereno will lose, but Carpio will lose more","Did you know that Senator Leila de Lima almost became a Chief Justice?

The Battles for Chief Justice over the past two decades are nothing short of Amazing. And yes, thats with an s, and a capital A.

IMPORTANT NOTE: ThinkingPinoy spoke recently with a Justice whos extremely privy to the inner workings of the Supreme Court. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because save for the Supreme Court spokesperson, court officials traditionally do not speak in public, and the Supreme Court heavily respects tradition. Unless otherwise specified, all claims here are based on the Justices version of events. 

Lets call him Justice Joseph de Mesa, or JD for short. For purposes of discussion, all pronouns will use Joseph as an antecedent but this should not in any way suggest the actual gender of this justice. You see, I fiercely protect my sources, especially JD because I will still need to talk to him in the near future and beyond, and I think he may need me to speak about things that he cannot say publicly himself.

Note that I have spent all night writing this so I do not have the time to proofread it anymore. I have a morning radio show Karambola sa DWIZ 882 at 8-10AM so I need to get some sleep. I apologize for any typographical error.

Lets go.

Whats gonna happen
JD said Solicitor General Jose Calida will be filing a Quo Warranto petition directed against the validity of Chief Justice Lourdes Serenos appointment.

A Quo Warranto is a writ or legal action requiring a person to show by what warrant an office or franchise is held, claimed, or exercised. Simply put, it requires the respondent  in this case Sereno  to justify why shes an associate justice.

If granted, Serenos appointment would be rendered void from the beginning, thereby effectively removing her from the Supreme Court. That is, the prospective Impeachment Trial that follows after the House of Representatives transmits the articles of impeachment to the Senate would be rendered moot and academic.
JD said the grounds would most likely include, among others,  Serenos failure to provide her SALN from the 10 years immediately preceding her appointment, and  Serenos psychiatric report.

Collateral attacks against impeachable officials, however, are supposedly forbidden under Philippine Law. Calidas Quo Warranto petition is an example of such. But then, JD said the Supreme Court has the final say on whats legal and what isnt, and the SC can find a legal way to go about it.

JD is right on that one. After all, the SC decision on Kabigting vs. Acting Director of Prisons [G.R. No. L-15548] states that the Supreme Court, being the court of last resort, is the final arbiter of all legal questions.

But I think it would be fun if we can let JD give us a glimpse of the inner workings of this institution, culminating to the problem that is Maria Lourdes Sereno.

Why the enthusiasm?
JD said this Sereno Saga is the unintended culmination of the maneuverings of Justice Antonio Carpio and his law firm CVC Law, or more popularly known as The Firm.

After President Joseph Estrada exited Malacaang in 2001, JD said successor President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo wanted to put Estrada in jail on plunder charges, with the help of Arroyos favorite law firm CVC Law. The trial, which ran from 2001 to 2007, made Estrada the first and only person convicted under the Philippine Plunder Law.
The Firm enjoyed immense influence during the early Arroyo years, as a number of its senior partners occupied powerful positions in the government:
Avelino Nonong Cruz was the Presidential Legal Counsel until his 2004 appointment as Defense Secretary [DND].
Simeon Marcelo was Ombudsman [Omb].
Joe Nathan Tenefrancia headed the Presidential Management Staff [AsiaLaw].
Then CVC Law senior partner Antonio Carpio was made Supreme Court Associate Justice in 2001, making him the one of the youngest SC appointees in history [SC], while the remaining senior partners managed The Firm: Arthur Pancho Villaraza was its CEO and Raoul Angangco was in the executive board.

But theres a catch: JD said Carpio wasnt supposed to be appointed to SC back then.

He said it was supposed to be Renato Corona.

Aniano, Renato, Antonio, Arroyo
In 2001, a slot in the Supreme Court was in the offing after the retirement of Justice Minerva Gonzaga-Reyes, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. All the lawyers close to Arroyo were gunning for the position.

JD said Arroyos Top Two Choices were Renato Corona, her long-time Chief of Staff, and Antonio Carpio who was, at the time, working for The Firm, the same firm that prepared the plunder case against Estrada.



The catch: theres only one Associate Justice slot for 2001, with the next one coming in 2002.

One of the two candidates had to give way.

JD said the eventual consensus was that Corona would be Associate Justice, while Carpio will be Ombudsman. Carpio supposedly agreed, as the Ombudsman is far more powerful than an Associate Justice.

Aniano Desierto, the sitting Ombudsman at the time, would complete his term in 2002 [Omb].

JD said on October 25, 2015, Arroyo gave Corona his appointment papers. The next morning, however, Corona was surprised to learn from a Palace aide that Carpio was about to take his oath as Associate Justice in a few hours. Afterwards, a military official approached Corona and said Arroyo requested the return of his appointment papers, and he did return them.

JD said Corona asked the military official if he can at least photocopy the document first, and the official obliged.

But why did this happen?
JD said the appointment of CVC lawyers to key government posts was no coincidence: he said CVC wanted to someday have a Philippine President who comes from their ranks and Carpios 2001 appointment was key.

JD said CVC had a well-designed long-term plan to put a CVC lawyer on top of the Philippine power pyramid:
Nonong Cruz, as defense secretary, would be able to establish connections in the Armed Forces.
Simeon Marcelo, as Ombudsman, can put a lid on any political opponent.
Joe Tenefrancia, as PMS chief, serves as Arroyos de facto cordon sanitaire. He potentially can block the access of CVC rivals to Arroyo. 
Pancho Villaraza and Raoul Angangco manage the Firm to ensure continuously massive income stream, i.e. funding for a future presidential campaign.
And JD said they plan to make Carpio a Philippine President, by turning him into a Chief Justice first.

Carpio was only 52 years old at the time, and thats very young by industry standards. A Chief Justice position would not only provide long-term power and influence, but it is a source of gravitas  a steppingstone  for a Presidential Aspirant.

Moreover, should future conditions be insufficient to justify a presidential run, Carpio can choose to remain Chief Justice, and he will do so until he reaches 70.

That means holding so much power for a long, long time.

But due to certain circumstance that will be explained shortly, JD said Carpio cannot be made Chief Justice if he wasnt appointed in 2001.

And JD said thats why Carpio had to betray his best friend Corona.

The Search for the Chief Justice
The Supreme Court heavily respects tradition, and it was the tradition at the time for a President to choose a Chief Justice among the three or the five most senior associate justices, with seniority based on the length of time served as associate justice.

JD said according to CVCs calculations, 2001 was the optimal date for Carpios SC appointment, i.e. it gives Carpio the best odds of becoming a Chief Justice while Arroyo was still president.

This made sense when JD told me that Carpio, along with CVC, supported the nomination of Associate Justice Artemio Panganiban for Chief Justice in 2005, right after Chief Justice Hilario Davide reached 70, the mandatory retirement age.

Upon Davides retirement, JD said the top choices were Justices Reynato Puno and Artemio Panganiban. However, Puno was a lot younger than Panganiban as he will reach 70 on 17 May 2010, or less than two months before Arroyo finishes her term.

JD said this is bad for CVC law, because thatd mean the ban on midnight appointments may be in effect, thereby preventing Arroyo from appointing a new chief justice to replace Puno.

JD said Panganiban, who turns 70 in 2007, was the more optimal choice vis--vis CVCs interests. By the time Panganiban retires, JD said Carpio would be among the top 5 most senior justices in the High Court, supposedly making him eligible for nomination as Chief Justice per tradition.

Panganiban was eventually appointed Chief Justice in 2005, which raised hopes for CVCs Carpio because he could be nominated for Chief Justice when Panganiban steps down in 2007.

And this will not be possible if Corona was appointed in 2001.

Carpio had to be it, and Corona was appointed to the Supreme Court in 2002, after another sitting justice retired.

For Carpio in 2005, so far, so good.

The Firm's Miscalculation
JD said everything was happening according to plan, until Carpio and CVC Law eventually made a terrible miscalculation.

On 27 June 2005, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo went on TV to admit that it was her voice behind the leaked phone conversation that ignited the Hello Garci Scandal [GMA]. Arroyos hold on power immediately fell under grave threat as she was bombarded by national media and other influential civil society groups.

Everybody  including a number of Arroyos own cabinet members  thought she would fall.

And thats what led to the Hyatt 10 incident, where seven secretaries of the Cabinet and three heads of government agencies simultaneously resigned from their posts on 08 July 2005. These officials include:
Corazon ""Dinky"" Soliman, Social Welfare Secretary notorious for allegedly pocketing Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) donations.
Imelda ""Meldy"" Nicolas, Lead Convenor of the National Anti-Poverty Commission and sister of Loida Nicolas-Lewis and one of the key figures involved in the #LeniLeaks Scandal.
Florencio Butch Abad, Secretary of the Department of Education and involved in the Dengvaxia Scandal.
What many failed to notice, JD said, was that it was actually CVC law who planned and executed this failed overthrow of Arroyo.

JD said it was CVC that flew to Hong Kong to meet then Vice-president Noli de Castro to ask him to succeed Arroyo upon the latters deposal. JD said CVC had to do this because the military, at the time, insisted that they would support a new government only through constitutional succession.

JD said De Castro rejected the offer. De Castro eventually went to Arroyo and explained to her that her own lawyers are scheming against her.

And that was when things went downhill for Carpio and CVC law, JD said.

Suffice it to say, when Panganiban stepped down as Chief Justice two years later in 2007, Carpio was already out of the running and Reynato Puno, who was bypassed in 2005, became the new Chief Justice.
Arroyo tightened her precarious grip on the presidency post-Hyatt 10 by pardoning the incarcerated Estrada [Reuters], in an attempt to quell the unrest among Estradas still-gigantic mass support base.

Afterwards, Arroyos was largely safe for the rest of her term, i.e. CVC was forced out of the Halls of Power until Arroyo stepped down in 2010.

With CVC Laws fall from grace, JD said The Firm started to feel financial strains, eventually leading to CVC splitting in into two separate firms as a couple of senior partners left the group over managerial and financial differences [Inq].

To make matters worse for Carpio, Arroyo controversially appointed Renato Corona as Chief Justice barely over a month before her term ended.

That is, the guy that Carpio supposedly betrayed for him to become Chief Justice, actually became the Chief Justice instead.

But JD said Carpio wasnt done just yet.

Carpio and Aquino
Aquinos first Supreme Court appointee was then University of the Philippines Law Professor Maria Lourdes Sereno. An academician with little to no litigation experience and zero experience as a trial judge, JD said Sereno badly needed a mentor and Carpio volunteered to be her sensei.


JD said Sereno is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, and Carpio was quick to take advantage. He said Carpio made Sereno his personal attack dog to pave the way for then Chief Justice Renato Coronas ouster.

This made quite some sense when I saw that Carpio and Sereno tag-teamed Corona on the Supreme Court decision involving Arroyos foreign travel for medical reasons.

I will not comment on whether Arroyo should have been allowed to travel or not, but whats clear is that Sereno, despite being the most junior Associate Justice, had the gall to lecture Corona  with uncharacteristically strong words  in her dissenting opinion.

Take a look at the 2011 GMA News report Dissenting opinions shed light on Corona's role in pro-Arroyo TRO to see how Carpio and Sereno apparently worked hand-in-hand against Corona.

Corona even publicly accused Carpio and CVC law of masterminding his impeachment, an allegation that The Firm denied [Inq].

Regardless, we all know that Corona was impeached in 2012. What we dont know, however, is that the Senate at the time supposedly told the Aquino Administration that it will impeach Corona on the condition that Aquino will not promote Carpio to Chief Justice. JD said many senators werent happy with the scheming Carpio, especially then Senator Jinggoy Estrada, who was put in jail thanks to the plunder case filed by Carpios Law Firm.

JD said Aquino agreed and the Senate removed Corona from office, and the search for the new chief justice was on.

Chief Justice Leila de Lima
JD said Aquino intended to fulfill his promise to the Senate not to appoint Carpio as Coronas replacement. After all, Aquino still needed the Senates support for his legislative agenda, among others.

He said Aquinos number two choice was the Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, which appears to absolutely true as de Lima pleaded multiple times to the Judicial and Bar Council to give her a fair chance at getting the Chief Justice nomination [Inq].

But de Lima didnt make the shortlist.

JD said Carpio gave strict instructions to Associate Justice Diosdado Peralta, who was JBC presiding officer back then, to specifically EXCLUDE de Lima in the shortlist, saying that Carpio told Peralta that de Lima would become CJ if that happened.

JD said JBC, as consolation to Aquino, complied with the latter's second request, which was to include Sereno in the shortlist. This explains why JBC included Sereno in the shortlist despite her failure to submit all the requirements.


To be fair to Peralta, I would probably exclude de Lima from the shortlist with or without Carpios prodding, for the simple reason that a newcomer has never been made a Chief Justice ever, and the SC supposedly respects tradition.

But JD said that from Carpio, who still had little idea about the deal Aquino made with the 2012 Senate, thought de Limas exclusion from the shortlist would enhance his chances at becoming Coronas replacement.

JD said Carpio then went on to tell then Associate Justice Lourdes Sereno to inhibit herself from the search for Chief Justice.

JD said that to Carpios horror, Sereno declined.

Sereno, like Carpio, WANTED to become chief justice.

And thats what happened. JD said despite Aquinos misgivings regarding Serenos qualifications, Aquino still had to choose her because  Shes one extremely loyal attack dog with a long shelf life and  Aquino wasnt familiar with all the other shortlisted candidates.

And voila! To Carpios unmistakable consternation, we got a Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno.

Serenos fall started during the ascent
Widely seen as Carpios attack dog that got Corona removed, Supreme Court employees greeted Serenos appointment with the utmost aloofness. JD said nobody wanted to work for her, and Sereno got people from outside, most of whom come from Serenos UP Law Portia Sorority Sisters.

JD said Corona was widely loved by employees in the Supreme Court, and they hated Sereno for being one of the conspirators behind his removal.

JD said Sereno and her staff didnt know how to be Chief Justice, so Sereno committed, wittingly or unwittingly, error after error. This cemented her reputation in the High Court as one of the most incompetent chief justices ever.

But Serenos problems go further beyond sheer incompetence, JD said. JD said Sereno brought her duplicity to the Office of the Chief Justice, as she deceived her High Court peers, in violation of the law.

For example, Sereno announced the launch of a Judiciary Decentralized Office without consulting the Supreme Court En Banc. Along with the launch was the announcement that she would appoint her friend, Sandiganbayan Justice Geraldine Econg, to head the said office.

The angered justices called Sereno for an En Banc meeting. Despite Serenos misdemeanor, the Justices still tried to be nice to her as they suggested to Sereno to gently take it down a notch. They asked Sereno to tell media that the JDO proposal was still being studied with Econg at the helm, providing Sereno and her friend a graceful way out.

However, instead of doing so, Sereno told the press that the En Banc affirmed Econgs appointment to the JDO, which is total opposite of what they agreed upon.

This is just one of the many infractions that Sereno committed, and I leave it to the reader to check recent news articles that detail how she violated other laws and protocols.

Sereno vs Duterte Round 1: Narco List
As expected, Sereno indeed became Aquinos most loyal attack dog in the Supreme Court, especially after President Rodrigo Duterte entered Malacaang in mid-2016.

At around 12:30 AM of Sunday, 07 August 2016, Duterte publicly released a Narco List that supposedly enumerates the names of current and former public officials who are involved in the illegal drug trade.

Among these names were eight judges, and Duterte expressly instructed the said judges to report to the Supreme Court right away and explain their side.

JD said that on Sunday morning, Court Administrator Midas Marquez, who would be in charge of the issue, suggested to Supreme Court spokesperson Theodore Teddy Te that the High Court could say:

The Chief Justice instructed the Court Administrator to wait for the judges tomorrow Monday and require them to submit their comments or explanations within a non-extendible period of five days after which the Court Administrator shall initiate an investigation into the allegations.

Note that the exact wording used may slightly vary because I only based the previous quote on the notes that I have written during the confidential interview.

On Monday morning and instead of heeding Marquezs suggestion, JD said Spokesperson Te sent a letter addressed to President Duterte and coursed through Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre, asking Office of the President to provide details of the allegations against the judges.

Aguirres Justice Department is in Padre Faura while Malacaang is in San Miguel Manila, and JD said Sereno didnt want to wait.

JD said Sereno was in a hurry to humiliate the president, so instead of waiting for Duterte to receive the letter from Aguirre, Sereno leaked the letter to traditional media on Monday afternoon.

In short, Duterte found out about Serenos letter through the media, and not through official correspondence.

Duterte felt extremely insulted, an he hates being humiliated. That's the kind of guy he is.

And thats where the Duterte-Sereno rift began, with Sereno drawing first blood.


Sereno vs Duterte Rounds 2, 3, and 4
But this is not the only time Sereno openly antagonized the president.

In January 2017, Sereno said that unsolved drug killings erode public trust in criminal justice system [GMA], a direct attack against Dutertes War on Drugs.

In March 2017, Sereno held hostage the papers of Dutertes newly-appointed Associate Justice when she refused to release the appointment papers of outgoing Sandiganbayan justice and now incoming SC Associate Justice Samuel Martires. Justices even said that Sereno went on a power trip as she reportedly wanted Martires to knock at her door and personally get his appointment papers from her. [MT].

In May 2017, Theres the time issue where Sereno spoke against Martial Law in a forum in Ateneo de Manila, three days after Duterte declared it in Mindanao [ABS].

And by August 2017, it appears the Dutertes allies collective patience wore thin, as the Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) and Atty. Larry Gadon attempted to impeach Sereno once and for all. The complaint appeared to have failed after failing to get an endorsement from any congressman [Inq].

But thats when the other Supreme Court justices, upon hearing the complaint, stepped in.


JD: Go Gadon!
JD said several justices who had an axe to grind contacted the House Leadership to offer testimony and evidence. JD said the first one was Associate Justice Francis Jardeleza, who was initially reluctant to testify and offered Speaker Alvarez documents instead. However, JD said Jardeleza lost his reluctance when one of the latters friend warned Jardeleza that Sereno may survive the impeachment attempt if he doesnt testify.

Sereno manipulated the JBC shortlist to exclude Jardeleza: Jardeleza almost didnt become an associate justice because of Serenos machinations [MT].

Jardelezas initiative encouraged the other Supreme Court justices to testify against Sereno, and thats what happened.

At first, I thought that the excruciatingly numerous House Hearings were intended to pressure the Senate into convicting Sereno in a prospective impeachment trial but I was wrong. From the looks of it and based on the following revelations, it appears that the House Hearings target audience was the public at large.

After several months of protracted impeachment hearings, the public has become aware of the multitude of violations that Sereno committed not only against the Supreme Court but against the Constitution itself.

In short, should the Supreme Court En Banc decide to take matters in its own hands, it can use the proceedings of the numerous hearings as justification for their actions. Compare that to simply firing Sereno through an administrative case, something that will make Sereno look like she was being ganged upon.

The House of Representatives is about to wrap up its impeachment hearings, and heres where things start to rapidly accelerate.

Calidas Quo Warranto
As mentioned at the beginning of this freakishly long article, JD said Solicitor General Jose Calida will be filing a Quo Warranto petition this morning, questioning the validity of Chief Justice Lourdes Serenos appointment.

Again, the High Court general frowns upon collateral attacks against impeachable officials, as that would usurp the Congressional Powers to Impeach.

However, JD said the SC will argue that an impeachment proceeding delves on acts that the Chief Justice committed after her appointment, while the Quo Warranto deals with those that were committed right before.

Based on how I understood JDs explanation, the Power to Impeach, which is the power to remove officials on the basis of acts committed AFTER they sat in office, will not be violated. This is because Serenos removal via a Quo Warranto petition uses a different Power, which is the power of the court to ensure that such appointment is valid to begin with.

I think the nearest analogy would be Bongbong Marcos electoral protest. The Supreme Court, sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, can remove VP Leni Robredo from office by declaring her win void from the beginning because she cheated. Removing Leni, an impeachable official, would be constitutional in that sense.

In the same way, the Supreme Court will say that Sereno cheated her way through by not submitting her SALNs prior to her appointment.

JD said Sereno herself admitted this. After being asked by the SC En Banc to explain her failure to submit her SALNs, Sereno said 2001-2006 was so long ago so she cant find them anymore so she sent JBC a letter explaining such, and the JBC subsequently exempted her from the SALN requirement.

JD said the problem is that Sereno has so far failed to provide a copy of the said letter the SC En Banc, and JD said the other justices suspect that this may just be another one of her schemes to deceive her High Court peers.

Finding the Perfect Timing
Regardless, JD said the High Court spoke with House Leadership and asked the latter if its possible to delay the transmission of the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, to give them enough time to deal with Calidas Quo Warranto petition without disrespecting the Senate.

JD said the Senate Leadership said is fine with this arrangement, as the Senate is currently swamped with so much work, they want the House of Representatives to transmit the documents in May 2018.

Given these, JD said SolGen Calida will file the Quo Warranto petition later today, 05 March 2018. Afterwards, Sereno will be given 15 days to submit a reply, and Calida another 15 days to counter. The entire exchange should end on the first or second week of April, giving the court ample time for oral arguments and enough time to pen a decision.

JD said the Supreme Court is poised to grant Calidas petition. They seriously want to kick Sereno out.

In short, JD said we can all forget about a Senate Impeachment Trial: he said Sereno will be gone from Padre Faura even before it starts.

With these said, I think that the biggest loser isnt Sereno, but Carpio. After betraying his friend in 2001, it appears that Karma retaliated several times.
First, when Arroyo made Puno CJ after he, the erstwhile CJ candidate, betrayed Arroyo.
Second, when Arroyo made Corona CJ, the same Corona that he betrayed.
Third, when Aquino appointed Sereno, who was just his attack dog.
And today, should JDs revelations turn out to be accurate, we will see an Antonio Carpio, the biggest critic of Dutertes Foreign Policy, see what little hope he has left vaporize.

Truth be told, I have no reason to doubt JD because he's been in the public eye for several years now and he's never been accused of lying. Even his friends, who I know personally, vouch for his honesty. Too bad he can't say all of these publicly because he's not the Supreme Court Spokesperson.

On a final note, Sereno will lose but shes still quite young: she still has a lot of years left to redeem herself. But Carpio, whos about to hit 70 in a year or two

Carpio appears to have started as a man with great potential. He then became the man who wanted to gain the world but lost his soul. And now, hes a soulless man who stands to lose his last sliver of hope for redemption.

What a sad existence that man endures.",RJ Nieto,"March 5, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/03/supreme-court-politics-sereno-will-lose.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#DengGate: Sanofi, DoH turned Pinoy kids into guinea pigs? No, a lot worse than that","The Department of Health and Sanofi's collective strategy in three words: ""INJECT AND FORGET"".

NOTES: 

A Table of References is included at the end of this article.
I'll just proofread a little later. I'm already exhausted.

In November 2017, Sanofi Pasteur in a press release admitted that its anti-dengue drug Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) may enhance dengue symptoms for seronegative recipients, or those who have never had dengue prior to vaccination . Two weeks later, the World Health Organization (WHO) seconded  Sanofis new contraindication as it advised against vaccinating seronegative individuals with the said drug.

Sanofi Dengvaxias flaw is in its ability to serve as a first-time infection for seronegative recipients, so that they immediately develop severe dengue right after their first real-life infection, as opposed to just mild or even asymptomatic dengue fever for seronegatives whove never received the vaccine.

This phenomenon is called Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Seronegative individuals infected for the first time with dengue develop lifelong immunity against the dengue strain that infected them. Should they be subsequently infected with a different strain, however, severe dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome occurs .
The confirmation of ADE in Dengvaxia Recipients would not have been much of an issue if not for the fact that Sanofi willfully neglected to conduct pertinent studies about this potential issue prior to launching the Aquino-era anti-dengue mass vaccination program in April 2016.
The Basic WHO Guidelines

A report delivered by Peter Smith of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine during the April 2016 WHO-SAGE meeting indicated that seronegative children 9 years and up are at risk of ADE. The 17 March 2016 WHO-SAGE background paper  reflects the results Smiths report as it, and so does a subsequent April 2016 WHO-SAGE paper .

The recommendations are as follows:
If 90% or more of a target population is seropositive, mass vaccination at 9 years of age offers optimal impact.
If over 50% but below 90% of a target population is seropositive, mass vaccination at 11 to 14 years of age is preferable.
If less than 50% of a target population is seropositive, mass vaccination is not recommended.
Using these WHO guidelines, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH), headed by Sec. Janette Garin, launched a mass vaccination program in April 2016 that targeted 1,000,000 4th graders in Luzon, most of whom are 9 years old. Almost half of this number were vaccinated before Garin left office in June 2016.

Per WHO guidelines, the decision to mass vaccinate 9-year-olds could only be justified if 90% of them are seropositive. And this is exactly what Garin claimed when she, in defense of the program, said, the DOH officials will be vindicated because we did something that will save 90 percent of Filipino children.

Garin bastardizes WHO Guidelines
Garin based her claim on the Alera Paper, a survey of dengue seroprevalence published February 2016, about two months before she mass-vaccinated the kids. A closer look at the paper, however, shows that either Garin intentionally misrepresented the paper, or shes just plain stupid, for the following reasons:

First, all the 1,000 survey respondents come from the Punta Princesa, a small village of 27,000 in Cebu City, so that the paper should apply to Punta Princesa alone. Even generalizing the findings to the entirety of Cebu City with a population of 923,000  would still qualify as terrible mathematics due to selective sampling.


But Garin did even worse: she used the seroprevalence rate of a small village in Cebu as a basis of the seroprevalence rate of a target population in the island of Luzon. This goes totally against the WHO recommendation that decisions should be supported by geographically relevant seroprevalence studie s. How in the world can a seroprevalence study in Cebu be applicable to Luzon?
Second, Figure 2 of the Alera Paper (shown below) indicates only 80% seroprevalence among those within the 6-15 age bracket, with no specific information pertaining to 9-year-olds. Per WHO guidelines at the time, 80% seroprevalence implied that mass vaccinations are recommended only for those 11 years and up and not 9-year-olds.


In short, Garin had no basis for her claim that 9-year-old kids in Luzon are 90% seropositive. Garin should not have greenlighted the April 2016 mass vaccination program at all.

But the Bad Science doesnt end there: aside from severe dengue, another side effect may also be multi-organ system failure. To make matters even worse, this multi-organ system failure may occur with or without a dengue infection.

Dengvaxia and Multi-Organ Failure
Tasked by the Justice Department with providing legal assistance to Dengvaxia victims, the Public Attorneys Office has autopsied 22 bodies as of 20 February 2018, with a lot more in line.

According to PAO Forensic Laboratory Dr. Erwin Erfe, these deaths seem to reveal a pattern: a vast majority of the autopsied remains show strong signs of Viscerotropic-Like Disease (VLD), characterized by the swelling and/or bleeding of multiple internal organs, which may have led to organ failure and eventually, death.

Some experts may dismiss Erfes claims as wild. However, no less than Bruno Guy of Sanofis Research and Discovery Department repeatedly admitted that VLD is a potential side effect of Dengvaxia. He admitted this in scientific papers he co-authored in 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016.

Despite lacking further studies on the incidence rate of VLD among Dengvaxia recipients, the Department of Health, along with its enabler Sanofi, greenlighted the Dengvaxia Program involving one million kids. The bad science on DOHs part is already a given, but adding the fact that Sanofi willfully sold DOH 1 million Dengvaxia regimens, despite the lack of data supporting such a massive requirement, suggests that Sanofi was complicit.

To make matters worse, many of these kids were never screened for pre-existing conditions that could have increased their risk for contracting not only VLD, but also severe dengue. Many of them even got vaccinated without consent from the kids parents.

Briefly Dissecting the Organ Failure Issue
There are two possibilities here:  VLD was due to the vaccine, or  VLD was due to some pre-existing condition. If the first is true, then were done. If the second was true, the absence of due diligence on the part of the DOH  in this case the sufficient pre-screening of vaccine recipients  puts the burden of evidence on DOH. That is, it may be presumed  at least in legal terms  that Dengvaxia caused VLD until the DOH or Sanofi proves otherwise.

For arguments sake, however, lets assume that a given casualty had a pre-existing condition that could have caused VLD. Would the victim remain alive if Dengvaxia wasnt around? Again, the fact that DOH and Sanofi agreed to administer Dengvaxia without sufficient pre-screening smacks of willful negligence on their part.

Again, there was no study to confirm the incidence rates of VLD  of multi-organ failure  among Dengvaxia recipients. Instead of conducting one, DOH and Sanofi decided to proceed with injecting a million kids with the experimental drug.

There are at least 22 casualties right now, and the figure is a very modest estimate at that.

Whichever way it goes, the collective criminal negligence of Sanofi and the Department of Health resulted into innocent kids of trusting parents being hospitalized, possibly with some of them ending up dead.

Sanofi thinks Filipino lives are less valuable?
The first step towards confirming the VLD risk among Dengvaxia recipients should be an attempt at benchmarking VLD incidence rates prior to the introduction of Dengvaxia.

After getting a suitable benchmark, i.e. an areas pre-Dengvaxia VLD incidence rate, it can then be compared to the ensuing post-Dengvaxia VLD incidence rate. That is, testing for statistical significance, the presence (or absence) of a considerable increase in VLD incidence rates after Dengvaxias introduction to a target population would confirm (or refute) the hypothesis that Dengvaxia may cause VLD.

Interestingly, Sanofi did sponsor a Step One (VLD Benchmarking) Study. With funding from Sanofi, RTI Health Solutions December 2017 paper entitled Incidence Study of Viscerotropic-Like and Neurotropic-Like Disease in Three Dengue-Endemic Countries, did exactly that. That is, the study attempted to estimate the incidence rate of multi-organ dysfunction prior to Dengvaxias market release.

The 2017 Sanofi Papers cover page is shown below:

Sanofi then acknowledged the papers receipt in December 2017.

Given this paper, checking for significant increases in post-Dengvaxia VLD incidence rates would be relatively easy, as we now have a figure to compare to.

But.


No Philippines?
Unfortunately, the study DID NOT include the Philippines: it includes only Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico. After, the paper itself admits that making direct comparison of results among the three countries is difficult, let alone comparing it to another country that wasnt included in the study, such as the Philippines.

That is, should the Malaysian, the Brazilian, or the Mexican governments can more easily check for significant increases in VLD cases should they decide to mass vaccinate kids with Dengvaxia.
That way, should multiple multi-organ system failure cases after Dengvaxia vaccination be reported, the government can more easily check if Dengvaxia did cause increased VLD incidence, or whether the number of such new VLD cases are too small to justify widespread alarm.

BUT THAT CANNOT BE DONE IN THE PHILIPPINES BECAUSE THE PHILIPPINES IS NOT IN THAT SANOFI PAPER.

DOH and Sanofi is hiding something
ThinkingPinoy has discovered a DoH-led coverup of the Dengvaxia Scandal in as early as December 2017, but it appears that theres more to in that just that.

Despite being the country with the greatest number of Dengvaxia recipients to date, Sanofi seems to have excluded the Philippines in the said VLD benchmarking effort. Why did Sanofi exclude the Philippines? Why did it choose Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico, when the fact of the matter is that the Philippines is the single biggest Dengvaxia buyer?

Did Sanofi think that Filipino lives are worth less than that those of Malaysians, Brazilians, and Mexicans or was Sanofi confident that Philippine regulators will greenlight Dengvaxia despite this glaring detail?

Well, based on the leaked DOH emails later confirmed to be authentic per the early February Senate Hearing on Dengvaxia, conflicted health officials were indeed overeager to launch Dengvaxia in Philippines.

For one, Health Undersecretary Kenneth Hartigan-Go was even volunteered to create new regulations to ease Dengvaxias entry into the country. Hartigan-Go has been a Zuellig beneficiary for most of his professional life. Zuellig is Dengvaxias exclusive distributor in the Philippines.

But wait, theres more.

Inject and Forget
A look at the fifth page of Sanofis Registration Application submitted to the Philippine Food and Drug Administration shows that Sanofi never intended to include the Philippines in the said benchmarking paper, as it declared that the study to measure background incidence rates of viscerotropism was being conducted in the three countries mentioned, with zero indication that Sanofi intends to include the Philippines in it.

Despite this, Sanofi promised FDA that it will conduct a 5-year monitoring of adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as when a recipient gets sick shortly after vaccination. The said AESI monitoring supposedly commenced right after the government starts injecting Dengvaxia.

Sources from both DOH and FDA informed ThinkingPinoy that Sanofi has yet to submit preliminary results of AESI monitoring to the government.

While it can be argued that the final report wont be there until five years after Dengvaxias launch, it must be noted that Sanofi promised in the same Registration Application to submit Period Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRER) every six months.

Unfortunately, almost 24 months have already elapsed since Dengvaxias Philippine Debut, yet not a single PBRER has been submitted to the DOH, suggesting either Sanofi is either willfully neglecting its statutory obligations or that the initial three PBRERs looks so bad, Sanofi doesnt want to give the DOH a copy.

Suffice it to say, DOH and Sanofi rushed the procurement, approval, and administration of the highly experimental drug Dengvaxia with little to no care about the side effects that Dengvaxia may cause.

To put it simply, Filipinos were indeed treated as if their bodies and souls are worth less than Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico.

Less than Guinea Pigs
ThinkingPinoy suddenly recalled Senator Dick Gordons accusation that Sanofi and DOH used Filipino kids as guinea pigs. Gordon's a little wrong: Guinea pigs are test subjects, but THERE ARE NO TESTS.

So if the hundreds of thousands of 9-year-olds who received Dengvaxia werent treated as guinea pigs, how exactly were they treated?

By the looks of it, Sanofi and DOH saw the 4th graders as disposable money machines, nothing more and nothing less.

At least twenty-two of those money makers have died so far, and were far from the end of this healthcare disaster of intercontinental proportions.

How many more deaths are needed for Sanofi to honestly address the crisis? And more importantly, how many more are needed for DoH to realize that it must advocate not for Big Pharmaceutical Companies, but for the Filipino People?

The answers to these questions, I do not know.",RJ Nieto,"February 20, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/02/denggate-sanofi-doh-turned-pinoy-kids.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake

PAO and Anjielika Pestilos
On 26 January 2018 press conference, Public Attorneys Office Forensics Laboratory chief Erwin Erfe released the official forensic and histopathological report for the case of Anjielika Pestilos, who died on 06 December 2017. Pathologists from the Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center performed the histopathology.

The Public Attorneys Office commissioned three forensic teams for this report:  a Clinical Team of 3 specialist doctors,  a Medico-legal team of 3 doctors, and  a Pathology Team of 2 Pathologists.


According to the medical report, Anjielica sustained hemorrhages in the lungs, heart, liver, and stomach. The hemorrhage in the lungs was extensive  involving both right and left lungs and all the lung lobes Anjielikas liver, spleen, and both kidneys are enlarged.

Anjilieka exhibited Viscerotropic-like disease similar to the Viscerotropic Disease associated with the Yellow Fever vaccine. Dengvaxia, a vaccine based on they yellow fever vaccine and contains live attenuated yellow fever virus, most likely caused the Viscerotopic-like Disease.

Erfe said, the underlying cause is viscerotropic-like disease secondary to Dengvaxia vaccination Dengvaxia is a live virus, a combination of the yellow fever virus and dengue virus.

Viscerotropic disease (VTD) is an acute multiple organ system dysfunction that occurs following vaccination. The severity of VTD ranges from relatively mild multisystem disease to severe multiple organ system failure and death.

Yellow Fever Vaccine-associated Multiple Organ-System Failure
CYD-TDV, marketed under the brand name Dengvaxia, is a dengue vaccine in a yellow fever 17D backbone developed by Sanofi Pasteur, meaning Dengvaxia is combination of the yellow fever virus and the dengue virus, albeit in a weakened form.

Viscerotropic Disease, or in plain terms multiple organ failure, has been associated as a side effect of the yellow fever vaccine. In particular, no other than Stamaril, Sanofi Pasteurs own yellow fever vaccine, lists viscerotropic disease as one of its side effects.

According to the MIMS pharmaceutical database:
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions:  Cases of viscerotropic disease (known as YEL-AVD and formerly described as ""Febrile Multiple Organ-System Failure""), some of which resulted in death, have been reported following yellow fever vaccination... The viscerotropic disease may manifest as fever, fatigue, myalgia, headache and hypotension progressing to metabolic acidosis, muscle and liver cytolysis, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, renal and respiratory failure.
Note that thrombocytopenia refers to low blood platelet count: platelets are more formally called thrombocytes while the suffix -penia means deficiency. Myalgia, on the hand, refers to muscle pain.

Simply put, yellow fever vaccine  including Sanofi Pasteurs yellow fever vaccine Stamaril  is known to have viscerotropic disease, a.k.a multiple organ-system failure, as a side effect.

More formally, this side effect is called Yellow Fever Vaccine-Associated Viscerotropic Disease, or YEL-AVD.

For example, a 2007 Yellow Fever mass immunization program of 42,000 Peruvians resulted in a number viscerotropism cases, four of whom died as result. 

How Dengvaxia is made
Dengvaxia is a live, attenuated vaccine, so it contains a version of the living dengue virus that has been weakened so that it does not cause serious disease in people with healthy immune systems. Because live, attenuated vaccines are the closest thing to a natural infection, they are good teachers for the immune system.

Aside from being live (alive) and attenuated (severely weakened), Dengvaxia has also been described as a chimeric vaccine, as it is a combination of two viruses.
Viruses have two basic parts: a nucleic acid core and a casing. In Dengvaxias case, the core is RNA from the Dengue virus, while the casing is from the yellow fever virus. Thus, Dengvaxia has a commonality with Sanofi Pasteurs Stamaril: the yellow fever virus casing; suggesting that Dengvaxia and Stamaril may share some common side effects.

On 10 December 2015, Sanofi-Pasteurs scientists themselves admitted a theoretical risk viscerotrophism among Dengvaxia Vaccinees. More specifically, Sanofi-Pasteur, led by Bruno Guy of its Research and Development Department, said:
The potential risks after vaccination of sensitization to severe dengue infection and of acute viscerotropic disease and neurotropic disease, which are very rare serious adverse events after vaccination with the yellow fever virus (YFV)-17D vaccine
Let ThinkingPinoy break this down for the reader. 

Sanofi admits potential side effects in 2015
In that peer-reviewed journal article from Vaccine, Sanofi-Pasteur admitted that Dengvaxia may have side effects that include, but are not necessarily limited to:

First, sensitization to severe dengue infection is, in simple terms, the worsening of the symptoms of a disease that a drug is supposed to alleviate or even eliminate, something that has been extensively discussed in the ThinkingPinoy article #DengGate: Mr. President, heres the memo you asked for.

Second, acute viscerotropic disease or multiple organ-system failure, which is the main contention of this article.

Third, acute neurotropic disease, in the case of some yellow fever vaccine recipients, manifest as meningoencephalitis, GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.

Meningoencephalitis is the inflammation and/or bleeding of the brain and/or its surroundings; GuillainBarr syndrome is when a persons immune system attacks a part of the nervous system; and encephalomyelitis as inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord that damages the protective covering of nerve fibers.
This bears repeating: in as early as 10 December 2015 and by Sanofis own admission, Dengvaxia has the theoretical possibility of causing the following side effects. Adding the fact that it was published in a widely-read scientific journal means that the risks must have been publicly known.

With that said, the operative term here is still theoretical as opposed to confirmed. Moreover, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration regulators can claim that they may have not seen Sanofis 10 December 2015 journal article yet when they issued Dengvaxias Certificate of Product Registration in 22 December 2015, i.e. there wasnt enough time because the two dates are just calendar 12 days apart.

But heres the problem: FDA knew it all along.

DoH, Sanofi and a coverup?
ThinkingPinoy obtained a copy of Dengvaxias Certificate of Product Registration (CPR), along with the Sanofi Dengvaxias filled-out Initial Marketing Authorization Application Form. The Marketing Authorization form is required for the issuance of CPR, which is basically Dengvaxias Philippine license to sell.
Dengvaxia's Certificate of Product Registration issued by the FDA

A cursory look at Sanofis CPR shows that it was classified as Prescription Drug (Rx), which is already a red flag. Why would then Health Secretary Janette Garin and her co-conspirators use an EXPERIMENTAL prescription drug in a Mass Vaccination Program?

FDA classified by Sanofi as Rx
But why, exactly, was FDA compelled to classify Dengvaxia as a prescription drug?

A look at Sanofis application, embedded below, reveals several soul-crushing reasons.


According to Sanofis own submission,by Sanofis own admission:
Four important identified risks have been established for [Dengvaxia]: allergic/anaphylactic reaction, viscerotropism and neurotropism, increase in severity of dengue disease from the start of vaccination and waning protection against dengue disease over time.
Aside from the two known side effects of Sanofis yellow fever vaccine Stamaril that were identified earlier (i.e. viscerotropism and neurotropism) and were cited as a potential side effect of Dengvaxia , Sanofi also admitted TO THE FDA that Dengvaxias list of potential side effects may include  anaphylactic reactions, which may cause sudden death due to respiratory failure and/or sudden decreases in blood pressure;  increase in severity of Dengue Disease, which the public has already been informed about recently; and  waning protection from Dengue over time.

Despite the FDA having full knowledge of Dengvaxias potential side effects, it is alarming to discover that Dengvaxias Full Prescribing Information, includes only serious allergic reaction, i.e. anaphylaxis, among the list of side effects listed in the Marketing Application.

This bears repeating: the FDA-approved label for Dengvaxia does not state the risk of viscerotropism, neurotropism, waning effectiveness, and enhanced dengue symptoms.

In short, FDA deliberately helped Sanofi  to the detriment of the Filipino People  by not letting our citizens know that Dengvaxia may cause multiple organ failure, severe nerve damage, enhanced dengue symptoms, and decreasing protection from dengue over time.

But why would they do that?

Stamaril vs Dengvaxia
As shown in the previoussection , the anti-Dengue vaccine Dengvaxia shares a few common possible side effects with its anti-Yellow Fever sister-vaccine Stamaril, the most controversial of which is viscerotropism, which is multiple organ-system failure.

Unlike Dengvaxia, however, multiple organ-system failure is included in Stamarils product label. This may sound puzzling because both vaccines are from Sanofi Pasteur. Given this, why would Sanofi be reluctant to do the same for Dengvaxia?

The obvious answer would be that any salesman does his best to downplay the disadvantages of whatever he sells. By not mentioning possible multiple organ-system failure, it would be a lot easier to sell Dengvaxia.

But a closer look shows a darker picture.
While Stamaril is confirmed to cause rare instances of multiple organ-system failure at a rate of about 0.4 per 100,000 doses, one dose of the vaccine provides life-long protective immunity against Yellow Fever.

On the other hand, the frequency of multiple organ-system failure for Dengvaxia recipients, while probably low, is still unknown. Moreover, Sanofi itself admitted that Dengvaxia, unlike its sister-vaccine Stamaril, provides DECREASING protection over time, i.e. it provides TEMPORARY and NOT LIFE-LONG protection. Add the fact that instead of providing protection from dengue, it actually WORSENS dengue symptoms to those who have never been infected with Dengue before vaccination.

For purposes of illustration, lets simplify the scenarios:

1 - STAMARIL: Suppose you were offered the vaccine Stamaril that has a 0.0004% chance of destroying your internal organs but will most likely give you lifetime protection from yellow fever, a disease that has a 15% chance of destroying your internal organs, would you accept the offer?

You most probably would, because the advantages obviously outweigh the disadvantages.

2- DENGVAXIA: Suppose you were offered the vaccine Dengvaxia that has a small but still unknown chance of destroying your internal organs, a vaccine that work only 60% of the time, and will provide you only temporary protection from dengue fever with a chance of worsening dengue symptoms if and when you get infected, will you accept the offer?

You most probably will decline the offer, because the tradeoffs are just too much.

But it gets even worse.

In Probability Theory, the Law of Large Numbers dictates that a low-probability event happens given a sufficient of trials. Modestly assuming a 0.0004 percent chance of multiple organ-system failure PER DOSE of Dengvaxia, 3 million doses administered would translate to approximately 12 cases.

Note, however, that the quoted probability is just based on passive surveillance of recipients of the yellow fever vaccine, so that real-world figures for the dengue vaccine -- which are unconfirmed because the drug up to now is still experimental -- may be higher.


Grossly Uninformed Consent
It would have been understandable if the parents were fully informed about the risks, but they werent. After all, which parent in his or her right mind answer yes to the following question:

Heres an experimental drug that TEMPORARILY protects your child from Dengue but it works only 60% of the time and it may also destroy your childs internal organs?

But of course, the Department of Health didnt ask that. Instead, they injected hundreds of thousands of Filipino kids without telling their parents
Theres around a 40% chance that the vaccine will not work at all,
That the vaccine may backfire as it worsens dengue symptoms for kids whove never had dengue
That the vaccine may destroy their kids internal organs, including their nerves, and,
That in the off-chance that the vaccine works, the protection is merely temporary, as opposed to many other more familiar vaccines that provide life-long protection.
Worse, they did not inform some of the parents at all, such case of the child from Tarlac that ThinkingPinoy investigated  in December 2017, a case that no less than the Deparment of Health tried to cover up.

And it doesnt help that Department of Health Secretary Janette Garin actively promoted Dengvaxia as if shes part of Sanofis marketing department.

In an interview interview that took place barely two weeks after FDA approved Dengvaxia, Garin said, [Dengvaxia] is recommended to those 9 to 45 years old, failing to mention any serious side effect.

I have reason to suspect that Garin and her accomplices in the government did all these for personal gain, as evidenced by leaked emails that demonstrate the Health Departments uncanny enthusiasm to get the vaccine approved, purchased, and mass-deployed in record time.

Dengvaxia: The New Vioxx?
By the looks of, the Dengvaxia saga appears to be following a storyline similar to Mercks blockbuster painkiller Vioxx.

According to a New York Times report:
[In 2000, Merck] consider(ed) whether to develop a study to directly test a disturbing possibility: that Vioxx might pose a heart risk. Two months earlier, results from a clinical trial conducted for other reasons had suggested such concernsBut the executives rejected pursuing a study focused on Vioxx's cardiovascular risks.
Vioxx was eventually pulled out in 2004 after the FDA itself confirmed the heart risk, with Merck agreeing to pay $950 million in fines, aside from other possible claims arising from invididual personal injury lawsuits.

Now, lets compare that to Dengvaxias situation.

Just like Vioxx, Dengvaxia has a potential side effects (multiple organ-system failure, nerve damage, severe dengue, etc) that warrants a larger confirmatory study, some of which have manifested when Sanofi tested kids aged up to 9 years old.

Instead of conducting the study, Sanofi simply told regulators that its ok to use Dengvaxia for those over 9 years old and at the same time told them that theres an off chance that such catastrophic side effects may occur.

A year after the mass immunizations launch, Sanofi finally confirms one of the side effects: that it enhances dengue symptoms among seronegatives.

Sanofis admission indeed hurt their drugs sales, but theres still some hope because the press release only affects seronegative recipients. Sanofi can still tap the seropositive market, i.e. those who have had a previous dengue infection, with an added bonus: Sanofi can develop and sell test kits that tests for seropositivity, providing Sanofi with an additional revenue opportunity.

Should Sanofi be fined several years later for concealing information and cheating the system, they wouldve already had earned billions from Dengvaxia, and they can use those billions to pay fines and other personal injury claims, similar to what Merck did with Vioxx.

But heres the problem: the Public Attorneys Office appears to be foiling that plan.

#StandWithPAO?
But heres Sanofis monumental problem: Dr. Erwin Erfe, Atty. Persida V. Rueda-Acosta, and their colleagues at the Public Attorneys Office PAO are starting to confirm what DoH and Sanofi deliberately concealed since 2015... that Dengvaxia may cause viscerotropism, or multiple organ-system failure.

Erfes 26 January 2018 announcement on the official forensic and histopathological report for the case of Anjielika Pestilos, where he mentioned the term viscerotropic-like disease, is a nightmare not only for Sanofi Pasteur and its billion-dollar Dengue vaccine program, but also to all the Health Department officials involved in this grand scheme of deception.

To make matters worse for Sanofi, preliminary results show that some of the other Dengvaxia cases handled by PAO may follow the same trajectory as that of Anjielikas.

If Erfe and Co. somehow succeeds to prove a link between Dengvaxia and any of the major side effects, a personal injury class suit will surely follow, which may cost the financially ailing Sanofi billions in damages and billions in lost potential revenues.

Yes, theres a chance that Erfe and the Public Attorneys Office may destroy Sanofi, Frances largest pharmaceutical company or at least hurt it to the tune of a few billion dollars.

And thats why Sanofi and its allies in the Philippine government is pulling out all stops to discredit the Public Attorneys Office, as it sends all the medical professionals in its payroll to attack the credibility of PAO, especially those of Dr. Erwin Erfe and PAO chief Atty. Persida Rueda-Acosta.

Why? Because if the Public Attorneys Office succeeds, then its the end not only for Sanofis hopes for Dengvaxia, but also for the careers of the top government officials who didnt mind endangering hundreds of thousands of poor Filipino kids for their own personal gain.",RJ Nieto,"February 7, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/02/doh-and-sanofis-secret-dengvaxia-may.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#DengGate: Leaked emails show Pnoy, Garin, Hartigan-Go intentionally bent rules for Sanofi","Leaked emails and other documents show how Aquino, Garin and Hartigan-Go magnificently orchestrated the approval of the untested Dengvaxia vaccine... and how they broke more than a few laws in the process.

But before that, here's a recap of recent developments.

Recent Developments
In a press briefing held earlier today, [Presidential Spokesperson] Harry Roque said, Finally, good news to the 830,000 parents whose children were given the Dengvaxia vaccine. The UP-PGH reported that out of 14 remains examined by UP-PGH, 13 of them were found to be totally unrelated to the vaccine. This means that only one case maybe causally associated with the vaccine.

iyan po ay mabuting balita doon sa 830,000 na mga nanay-tatay na naaabalat natatakot na baka may banta sa buhay ng kanilang mga anak, Roque added.


[TRANSLATION: Thats good news for the 830,000 parents who are troubled and worried that their lives of their kids are at risk.]

Roque misinterpreted the UP-PGH report.

Verifying Roques claims
ThinkingPinoy spoke via phone with Department of Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, who heads the Dengue Task Force technical committee that asked the University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital to create the Expert Panel on Dengvaxia.

Doming said, Parang hindi pa niya nakita yung report. Ni-report ng expert panel na at least tatlo ay siguradong dengue, tapos may six na kailangang pag-aral pa para maging certain kung ano yung cause of death, kung connected siya [sa Dengvaxia].

[TRANSLATION: It seems like he hasnt seen the report. The expert panel reported that at least three are certainly dengue cases, while we still need to further investigate six cases to ascertain the causes of death, if theyre related to Dengvaxia.]

Baka si Harry Roque, hindi niya naintindihan yung report. Actually, hindi pa niya nakikita ang report. Ang nakakita pa lang ng full report, sigurado ako, ako pa lang at si Sec. Duque, Domingo added.

[TRANSLATION: Maybe Sec. Roque didnt understand the report. Actually, he hasnt seen the report. Im certain that only Health Sec. Duque and I have seen the report so far.]


Ang sinasabi nga natin, sigurado nang may na-dengvaxia at namatay siya ng dengue kaya kailangan silang bantayan at alagaan, yun yung [essence] ng report, Domingo said.

Domingo corrected Roques interpretation of the PGH report.

Domingo said, Ang conclusion namin doon sa report, kailangang mag-ingat kasi may namamatay ng Dengue, hindi naman ganoon kadami pero mayroon. At saka, yung anim na nabakuhanan, may sakit sila so hindi dapat nag-mass immunization program nang hindi pa nacheckup isa-isa ang mga bata.

[TRANSLATION: We concluded in the report that we need to be cautious because there are deaths from dengue [even after inoculation with Dengvaxia]. Its not that many, but there still are. Moreover, six of the children may have had pre-existing conditions so there should not have been a mass immunization program without screening each of the kids.]

Yung anim na namatay, parang may pre-existing conditions so hindi dapat nag-mass immunization na tusok nang tusok. Mali talaga, hindi talaga dapat siya ginawa, Domingo added.

[TRANSLATION: Six of the kids may have pre-existing conditions so they shouldnt just inject one after another. Its wrong, it should not have been done.]

Domingo said, Dengvaxia should not have been used in a mass immunization program without screening each and every child prior to injection kasi mukhang may association with pre-existing conditions.

[TRANSLATION: Dengvaxia should not have been used in a mass immunization program without screening each and every child prior to injection because there appears to be an association with pre-existing conditions.]

In another text conversation, Usec. Domingo said, DOH also feels justified that the Dengvaxia mass vaccination was stopped. Several children with pre-existing illnesses died within 30 days of vaccination, which means Dengvaxia is not safe for a mass immunization program where children are not thoroughly screened one by one.

Roque takes a swipe at PAO
Coincidentally or not, both the Public Attorneys Office (PAO) and the UP-PGH expert panel are conducting investigations on the same number of alleged Dengvaxia victims, so that Roques February 3rd announcement may have led to some confusion as it was interpreted by some people as an assessment of the 14 cases being handled by PAO.

Further exacerbating the confusion was Roques statement that, given his awareness of PAOs efforts, can easily be interpreted as a swipe against PAO.

In yesterdays press briefing, Roque said, Kung maalala niyo po, ang DoH po ang nagtatalaga at humihingi sa UP-PGH na sila na ang mag-aral para magkaroon ng objective na pag-aaral kung ano talaga ang naging epekto ng Dengvaxia.

[TRANSLATION: If you can recall, the DoH requested the UP-PGH to investigate (the Dengvaxia Scandal) so there can be an objective study of the actual effects of Dengvaxia.]
PAO swiftly reacted to Roques announcement.

In a statement, PAO said, Noong nagdeklara ang UP PGH na may 14 cases sila, nakaka LIMANG (5 batang namatay na naturukan ng Dengvaxia) Forensic Examination pa lamang ang PAO FORENSIC TEAM. Nitong Thursday (Pebrero 1, 2018) lang naisagawa ng team ang pang #14 at #15, patunay na walang basehan at pinanggalingan ang sinasabi na ang 14 cases nila ay galing sa PAO. (sic) [PAO]

[TRANSLATION: When UP-PGH declared their 14 cases, only 5 kids have been under PAOs Forensic Examination. It was only this Thursday (01 Feb 2018) that the team performed autopsy #14 and #15, proof that their claims  that the 14 cases are from PAO  are baseless.]
Health undersecretary Domingo confirmed PAOs claims.

Domingo said, Magkaiba yon, kasi yung 14 ng PGH, sourced ito since 2016 so hindi naman siguro lahat na an e yung na-autopsy ng PAO.

[TRANSLATION: Theyre different because the PGHs 14 were sourced since 2016 so I dont think they have all been autopsied by PAO.]

One of the several Dengvaxia cases being handled by PAO.

Asked if PAO and UP-PGH indeed have different list of Dengvaxia victims, Doming said,Oo. Siguro magkamukha yung listahan ng 29 cases, pero yung 14 cases doon sa expert panel report, hindi siguro yun yung 14 cases ng PAO na kanilang na-exhume. Kasi yung kanilang na-autopsy, bago pa lang.

[TRANSLATION: Yes. The list of 29 cases may be the same, but the 14 in the expert panel report are probably not the same as the 14 exhumed by PAO because they are fairly newly-discovered.]

But the misinformation doesnt stop with Roque, because we also have former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral doing her part.

The heavily conflicted Sec. Cabral
We urge the Department of Justice to order the Public Attorneys Office (PAO) to stop performing autopsies on these children and leave the matter of determining the cause of death [of the children who received the Dengvaxia vaccine for free] to competent forensic pathologists, Doctors for Public Welfare (DPW), which is led by former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral, said in a statement on Saturday [GulfNews].

Cabral, like Roque, clearly took a swipe at the Public Attorneys Office, which was mandated by the Deparment of Justice to provide legal assistance to the families of Dengvaxia victims.

DPW, through Cabral, said, It makes no sense for any more families to be subjected to the torture of having a loved one exhumed and cut up only to find out that no useful information was derived from the cruel act.

In fact, the deaths of 13 of them were totally unrelated to the [Dengvaxia] vaccine, the DPW said.

Health undersecretary Domingo has clarified this issue in the previous section, i.e. the UP-PGH expert panel never said that 13 of the 14 cases handled by UP-PGH are unrelated to Dengvaxia.

Where did Cabral base this information from, especially since shes not even part of the UP-PGH panel to begin with?

Cabral and DPWs uncanny enthusiasm to defend Dengvaxia is disconcerting, to say the least.

According to sources within the PAO, it was Cabral who convinced DOH officials to continue the Dengvaxia program after Aquino stepped down.

But then, it appears that it actually is in Cabrals personal interest to defend Dengvaxia, because she is a Trustee of the [Zuellig Foundation] [A].

 
Former Health Sec. Cabral is Zuellig Foundation Trustee. Zuellig Pharma is Dengvaxia's exclusive distributor in the Philippines.

Zuellig Foundations parent company, Zuellig Pharma, is the exclusive distributor of Sanofis Dengvaxia in the Philippines. In fact, the anomalous P3-billion purchase order for Dengvaxia was addressed not to Sanofi Philippines, but to Zuellig Pharma.

Sec. Cabral, the flag-bearer of Doctors for Public Welfare, is part of the Sanofi-Zuellig Family.

Now that can explain her enthusiasm. She fights not for this country, but for her personal interests.


When Politics mixes with Public Health
Since the Dengvaxia Scandal erupted in November 2017, there have been several calls by so-called experts to depoliticize the problem, as they claim Mixing that public health should be the paramount concern, and the legal issues as, somewhat, a secondary priority.

But therein lies the fundamental problem: it is the politicization of public health that got the country into this mess.

ThinkingPinoy agrees that the Health Department should take a more aggressive stance in addressing the Public Health issue arisingfrom the Dengvaxia Scandal. Going after erring officials, however, is just as important.
Putting corrupt officials who were instrumental in creating this mess is the best way to restore the general populations trust in Philippine Public Healthcare, trust that was lost after the previous administration decided to roll out an insufficiently tested drug en masse.

With that said, however, ThinkingPinoy believes that establishing the causal link between Dengvaxia and the deaths should best be entrusted to medical professional who have the requisite knowledge, experience, and integrity.

The politics part of the issue, however, is well within ThinkingPinoys domain, and thats what shall be discussed next.


A Quick Recap
The question on whether there was undue haste in the governments procurement of Dengvaxia need not be asked. At this point, it is now question of how hasty the procurement process was, who exactly did what in the railroaded procurement process, and whether their actions are merely coincidences or whether there was a deliberate effort to violate the law to favor Sanofi and/or its affiliates.

In a statement last month, [Senator Richard Gordon] said, Napakabilis talaga ng proseso, parang minadali nila. Hindi nasunod yung usual na process ng pag-peprepare for implementation of a new vaccination program. Nakita na natin sa hearing nung December last year na after every meetings abroad between Sanofi executives and President (Benigno) Aquino or Secretary (Janette Loreto-) Garin, magkakaroon ng bagong development sa procurement process at lalo itong bumibilis.

[TRANSLATION: The process was really fast, as if they rushed it. The process for the implementation of new vaccination programs wasnt followed. We saw in the December hearing last year that each time Sanofi executives and President (Benigno) Aquino or Secretary (Janette Loreto-)Garin meet, there came a new development in the procurement process and it further accelerates.]

Most of what has been revealed so far are a few testimonies from Senate Hearing resource persons but theres little in the way of actual direct documentary evidence showing the Health Departments hand in railroading the procurement process and thats what well help provide right now.

An FDA official who can't stomach the corruption in the Public Healthcare System contacted ThinkingPinoy to provide him with copies of internal documents showing several officials from the FDA and DOH actively moving to railroad the approval of Sanofi-Pasteurs Dengvaxia.

Lets go.


March 2014: Sanofi consults FDA
On 11 March 2014, Sanofi Regulatory Affairs Manager Jervin Papelleras sent a letter addressed to then FDA director Kenneth Hartigan-Go and FDA Center for Drug Regulation and Research (CDRR) head Lourdes Santiago. It was a cover letter for the minutes of the meeting between FDA and Sanofi held on 03 March 2014.

The document, along with the attachments, is embedded below:


The letter in itself doesnt look like its anything out of the ordinary. Whats troubling, however, are the attachments. According to the minutes attached to this letter, Sanofi in 2014 was discussing with FDA its registration strategy in 2015, following the last meeting with FDA in 2012.


Why is Sanofi consulting the FDA about its registration strategy when all the information about product registration is readily available in the [FDA website]? Sanofi is a gigantic pharmaceutical firm, so why would it even need to personally coordinate its registration with FDA officials when they must already be very familiar with the process?

ThinkingPinoy consulted a senior Health Department official about this and she said, Meron pang registration strategy? E wala naman dapat strategy e isa lang naman dapat ang paraan ng pagre-register. Pag tiningnan mo yung FDA website, yung how to register a product, Im sure walang meeting-meeting (involved). Dapat nga, walang private meetings required yung buong registration process.

[TRANSLATION: Theres a registration strategy? There should be no strategy because theres only one way to register. If you look at the FDA website, on how to register a product, Im sure there are no meetings involved. There should have been no private meetings involved in the entire registration process.]



The Minutes of the Meeting
Sanofis highly irregular consultation with FDA took place at a time when Dengvaxias Phase III Trials in the Philippines was still ongoing, as shown in the screenshot taken from the embedded document in the previous section:


That is, FDA was actively helping Sanofi register a product that, at that time, has completed only its Phase II trials. That is, FDA was helping Sanofi register Dengvaxia even if Dengvaxia was still, by all intents and purposes, an EXPERIMENTAL drug.

This is wrong. The FDA is a regulatory body that approves or rejects registration applications, it should not be in the business of coordinating the marketing efforts of pharmaceutical companies, especially those involving untested products!

Scrolling further down the attachment, ThinkingPinoy stumbled upon a clue, as shown below:
The image above is a screenshot of the Sanofis proposed Dengvaxia registration timeline as submitted to FDA. The first column refers to the stage of registration while the last column shows the pertinent laws and regulations that Sanofi should comply with.

Hartigan-Gos FDA Circular 2013-004
ThinkingPinoy takes great interest in one of the cited regulations, which is FDA Circular 2013-004.

In December 2017, ThinkingPinoy questioned the credibility of FDA head Kenneth Hartigan-Go when it was found out that Hartigan-Gos career is too closely intertwined with Zuellig, whose pharmaceutical division is the exclusive distributor of Sanofi Dengvaxia in the Philippines.

Hartigan-Go was the head of the Zuellig Foundation prior to joining the Aquino Administration in 2010 and after he left in 2016, he headed the Asian Institute of Managements Zuellig Graduate School [AIM].

(Note that former Health Sec. Esperanza Cabral, who leads the group Doctors for Public Welfare that has been making PR rounds in the media lately, is a trustee of the Zuellig Foundation that Hartigan-Go used to manage.)

In that critique, ThinkingPinoy wrote:

through Hartigan-Go's FDA Circular No. 2013-004, Phase IV trials for new vaccines were made optional, so that new drugs can basically enter the market right after Phase III Hartigan-Go's FDA circular immensely benefitted Sanofi Pasteur Inc, whose defective anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia just finished Phase III trials in late 2014, so that a Phase IV trial would have delayed mass market sales to 2017.

And voila! FDA Circular 2013-004 is indeed in Sanofis Registration Strategy.


Again, why is FDA going out of its way to actively assist Sanofi in legalizing Dengvaxia?

FDAs director is a Sanofi beneficiary, for one.

FDA Circular 2013-004 greatly benefitted Sanofi as it accelerated the latters marketing efforts. By making Phase IV trials optional, Hartigan-Go allowed Sanofi to mass-market Dengvaxia three years earlier than it would have.

Hartigan-Gos circular made the controversial Registration Strategy possible. And it appears that Hartigan-Go wasnt content with just that: he helped Sanofi all throughout the registration process, and more.

We shall go back to Hartigan-Go a little later. Let's talk about the bigger fish first.

Garin and Sanofi in May 2015: A Coincidence?
At this point, the reader may already have an inkling that the FDA is in on it, but the FDA, by itself, cannot orchestrate this entire hullabaloo: it must have the imprimatur from upstairs.

According to Philippine diplomatic records, Garin was in various official engagements in France in May 2015, including a dinner in Paris on May 14, 2015 between Garin and Guillaume Leroy, Vice President of Sanofi-Pasteurs Dengue Vaccine Program [ABS].

Garin would probably deny that theres anything fishy that went on, but a leaked email will say otherwise, as shown below:

On 18 May 2015, just four days after the Garin-Sanofi meeting, FDA deputy director-general Lourdes Santiago emailed other FDA officials about Sanofis Rolling Submission of Dengue Vaccine.

Santiago wrote, Kumpleto na ba? Any submission recently? Meeting with Sec. Garin later to inquire about the progress.


FDA and DOHs collective enthusiasm over Dengvaxia would have been acceptable if there was a massive dengue epidemic in the country. According to sources from the Deparment of Health, while there are seasonal dengue fever outbreaks, there has never been a dengue outbreak of epidemic proportions in recent history.

Another email provides more clues. This email shown in the image belowis an 11 May 2015 invitation for FDA officials to attend a World Health Organization conference in Switzerland about Sanofis Dengvaxia, at the time still called CYD-TDV.


Healthcare industry veterans that Thinkingpinoy consulted said that given modern telecommunications, these trips are just junkets that pharmaceutical companies give to industry decision-makers to curry their favor.

Oooohhh....SWITZERLAND!!! 

PNoy and Sanofi in December 2015: Another Coincidence?
On 02 December 2015, the [Official Gazette] reported that officials of Sanofi Pasteur met with President Aquino in Hotel Scribe in Paris. With Aquino were Health Secretary Janette Garin, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, Trade and Industry Secretary Gregory Domingo and Transportation and Communications Secretary Joseph Emilio Aguinaldo Abaya. A photo of their meeting is shown below.

Aquino, Garin, Purisima, Abaya and Co. meet Sanofi execs in France on 02 December 2015

A courtesy call is just a more formal term for a quick Hello!, but it seems that more than just a courtesy call happened, as evidenced by the email shown below:


On the same day, Sec. Garin asked FDA deputy director Santiago, When will the CPR for dengue vaccine be probably released?



CPR is the Certificate of Product Registration, a document issued by the FDA that serves as the license for a product which, in this case, is Sanofis Dengvaxia.

Santiago replied, We are trying the (sic) have the final assessment report done by the second week of December po.

Ok. Please keep me posted. TY, Garin replied.

Did Garin ask (and obviously, pressure) FDA about Dengvaxia just because she felt like it?

Of course not, as shown in the email below:


On 18 December 2015, or about two weeks after the previous email, Garin asked FDA, When can the Dengue vaccine be approved?



Garin didnt ask the FDA if it will approve Dengvaxia or not: she asked when FDA shall approve it!


Changing the Rules to benefit Sanofi?
A month later, another leaked email from former FDA head and then Health undersecretary Kenneth Hartigan-Go (yes, the same guy who made Phase IV trials optional) reveals very disturbing reality: that the Aquino-era DoH really intended to bend the laws to benefit Sanofi.

After getting its hastily-issued FDA Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) in December 2015, Dengvaxias fate was transferred into the hands of the Formulary Executive Committee (FEC). In simple terms, a CPR makes a new product legal to sell, but it requires an additional FEC clearance to allow the government to buy it.

That is, an FEC clearance is required for the Aquino Government to buy P3 billion worth of dengue vaccines from Sanofi. Without FEC or an FEC exemption, that would not be even in the least bit legally possible.

In a 27 January 2016 email shown above , Usec. Hartigan-Go told key regulatory agency officials, If a protocol needs to made, and technically and ethically reviewed, I think you should all focus and fast-track this work, otherwise we all get into trouble or create preventable problems.



Why did Hartigan-Go say this?
Dengvaxia was a newly-registered drug at the time and it has not even completed Phase III trials, let alone Phase IV trials, by the time it was handed over to the FEC approval.

FEC regulations require a Post-marketing Surveillance Report (PMS), which would have existed had there been a Phase IV trial for Dengvaxia. But as the reader may recall, Hartigan-Go himself made Phase IV trials optional in 2013, while he was still FDA chief.

Dengvaxia, at that point, was in limbo: how can the FEC clear Dengvaxia when it is not compliant with existing rules?

Heres where Usec. Hartigan-Gos message becomes relevant, as he explicitly told regulators that the Aquino Government was willing to change the rules  or even create new regulations (protocols)  to ensure that the government can purchase Dengvaxia.

Again, and this bears repeating: there had been no Dengue Epidemics in the recent past.

In the same email, Hartigan-Go even gave a heads up to regulators as he informed them of possible questions from President Aquino.

What we have seen here is not just simple negligence, but one magnificently orchestrated crime that involves the top officials of the Aquino Administration.


ThinkingPinoy's Takeaways
ThinkingPinoy agrees with Senator JV Ejercito in that we need a more sober discussion of the #DengGate Scandal.

However, that is easier said than done given Sanofi's massive PR operations, including the efforts of former Health Sec. and ""Doctors for Public Welfare"" head Esperanza Cabral, a trustee of Zuellig Foundation.

Zuellig Pharma is the exclusive distributor of Dengvaxia in the Philippines.

Some camps dismiss PAO's announcements as mere histrionics, but as the legal counsels of marginalized Dengvaxia victims, it is their job to advocate for their clients, in the same way that Cabral et Al advocate for their Big Pharma benefactors.

The Pharmaceutical Lobby has very deep pockets. It's more than probably armed with a war chest bigger than the National Government's. And just like any creature, it will do everything it can - including emptying that massive war chest - to survive.

The problem, however, is that Big Businesses are borne not out of altruism, but for the amoral end of profit.

Sanofi is not immoral: it is amoral. Without the government giving it considerable incentive to align with Public Interest, it will not do so.

Hence, what we need is a government response that definitively displays Political Will to force Sanofi into submission, something that our government, so far, has failed to demonstrate. Needless to say, the current government should go after the corrupt officials that were instrumental in the creation of this Public Health debacle.

PAO, despite its flaws, is doing its best to advocate for the victims. Without PAO, this issue would have already been covered up, just like most of the corrupt acts of government officials in the not too distant past.

With that said, I wish all other government agencies involved in this mess will show the same kind of tenacity that PAO has been showing since the Dengvaxia Scandal began.

Filipino first, dear friends... and neither Sanofi nor Zuellig are Filipinos.

An ex-Roxas PR lady's journey from Mamasapano to #CocoyGate to 2019,"A notorious PR operator is back on the move?

I was thinking twice about publishing this article so I asked my Facebook followers if they want it or not.


Nine-sixty percent of the over 15,000 respondents voted ""Yes"", so here we go.

It started with #NasaanAngPangulo
In the February 2017 expos #NasaanAngPangulo: Mamasapano, Mar Roxas Ambition, and a PR operator, ThinkingPinoy detailed how the Liberal Partys Mar Roxas, via his DILG right-hand man and Akbayan party-list stalwart Tomasito Tom Villarin, attempted to insulate himself the Mamasapano-SAF 44 scandals fallout through the #NasaanAngPangulo black propaganda campaign led by Public Relations (PR) operator Joyce Ramirez.

Garnering over a million hits and over 64,000 shares, the article was a big blow not only against whatevers left of the Liberal Partys credibility, but also on the Ramirez professional reputation as an online political kingmaker.

Public interest over this issue generally subsided until October 2017, when Senator Grace Poes Committee on Public Information and Mass Media called for a hearing about Fake News, a hearing where ThinkingPinoy was a resource speaker.

#NasaanAngPangulo and the Senate Hearing on Fake News
During the hearing, ThinkingPinoy cited the 2015 #NasaanAngPangulo PR campaign, where Ramirez used Twitter influencer fleet INTERXN to channel public dismay over the Mamasapano debacle solely on then President Noynoy Aquino, theoretically preventing bad press against Mar Roxas, who was eyeing the 2016 presidency.

Some of PR Asia Worldwide's 2015 tweets re: #NasaanAngPangulo


In the hopes of having a more honest discussion about the proliferation of online political propaganda, ThinkingPinoy recommended that the committee invite Ramirez, along with #LeniLeaks PR operator Pete Silva, the head of an unrelated PR campaign sponsored by the Office of Vice President Leni Robredo.

In retaliation, Ramirez appeared during the evening news to claim that ThinkingPinoy is a fame whore and social climber and that the allegations made against her during the senate hearing are false.
In response, ThinkingPinoy published #CocoyGate: Mar Roxas special assignments for PR Joyce Ramirez, which provided details on how Ramirez executed the not only the #NasaanAngPangulo campaign, but also her eventual falling out with her Liberal Party-Akbayan clients after Roxas supposedly failed to pay her for her PR services on time.

A Facebook conversation between Ramirez and one of her former INTERXN influencers

Garnering over 30,000 shares, the article effectively decimated whatevers left of Ramirez reputation as the go-to PR person for online political propaganda as her latest client informed me that they have fired her just a couple of days after the articles publication.


The anatomy of a PR machine
Every PR operator has a fleet of influencers that she can pitch to potential clients.

For traditional PR companies, that means an operator must have print, media, and radio journalists on the payroll, journalists that she can quickly tap for prospective propaganda campaigns. For online PR companies, on the other hand, that means having a fleet of online influencers, such as persons with large social media follower counts.

An example of a traditional PR company mentioned in April 2017s On Manufactured Noise, anti-Duterte media bias makes financial sense, which tells the story of the workings of a veteran journalist who served as an integral part of the late Bubby Dacers PR operations during 1990s. Dacer was eventually murdered in 2000.

Meanwhile, an example of an online PR company is no other than Ramirezs PR Asia Worldwide Communications Inc., whose tagline is We don't make noise. We create RELEVANCE. Initially engaging in solely in Entertainment PR work, the company eventually expanded to potentially more lucrative political PR work, as evidenced by the #NasaanAngPangulo PR campaign.

A screenshot of PR Asia Worldwide's LinkedIn Profile
Politicians initially recognized Ramirezs PR Asia Worldwide for having control over some of the top local Twitter celebrities, and these fleet of Twitter celebrities, which Ramirez called ""INTERXN"", was PR Asia Worldwides bread and butter.

The Rise of Facebook
Twitter lorded over political conversations for much of the past several years, until Facebook took over in 2016. In as early as January 2016, twice as many Filipinos are on Facebook as there are on Twitter, according to WeAreSocials Digital in 2016 Report, the relevant slide of which is shown below:


And everybody knows how Facebook helped catapult then presidential contender Rodrigo Duterte during the 2016 Presidential Elections. More than that, Facebook was able to drown traditional media in as far as shaping the political landscape, as evidenced by the ineffectiveness of anti-Duterte political ads aired during the 2016 campaign season. This has been extensively discussed in the August 2017 article Mainstream vs Indie: Whos winning the social media wars?.

Suffice it to say, Facebook will be the primary barometer of the incoming 2019 National Elections. Hence, online political PR companies have probably realized that they need to have a sizeable Facebook fleet not only to stay relevant but also to command better prices come the next election season, which is in 2019.

And this the challenge for PR Asia Worldwides Joyce Ramirez, who has yet to establish one that matches the collective influence of her INTERXN twitter fleet.

Building a Facebook Fleet
Every journey starts with one step, and the first step for any PR operator who wishes to gain power in Facebook would be to access major influencers.

I suspect that one of Ramirezs first major Facebook influencers is De La Salle University professor Antonio Contreras, who repeatedly attempted to set up a reconciliatory meeting between ThinkingPinoy and Ramirez, who promised his former radio show co-hosts of lucrative sponsorship deals through Ramirez, and who brazenly dissuaded ThinkingPinoy from publishing the October 2017 #NasaanAngPangulo follow-up expos.

ThinkingPinoy initially gave Contreras the benefit of the doubt, until he found out recently that Contreras, a supposedly staunch Duterte supporter and presumably a consultant of the Presidential Communications Operations Office, may have serious integrity issues.
Contreras was staunchly anti-Duterte in as late as 29 April 2016, or barely two weeks before Duterte won the 09 May 2017 elections. Contreras described Duterte as mabaho ang bunganga, pumapatay ng tao, corrupt, a liar, handang patayin ang kriminal kahit hindi sumailalim (sa due process), no better than a thief, an evil human, a defiler, ulyanin, and Dudirty.

Here are some screenshots:




More screenshots can be found by clicking here.

In fairness to Contreras, we are all entitled to change our minds. What perplexes this writer, however, is the speed at which he did it.

In his late April 2016 posts, Contreras even went as far as saying that hes glad that not a single one of his family members was voting for Duterte, and that electing Duterte would make us the laughing stock of the world.


Despite this and despite having openly supported Jejomar Binay whom Duterte himself called corrupt, Contreras apparently and suddenly became a staunch Duterte supporter after Duterte won, as he even hosts the PCOO-sponsored web series Busting Lies even if he himself was a purveyor of lies right before Duterte earned his ticket to the palace.


These posts were made just two weeks before the elections, and the only thing new that happened between his 29 April 2016 post and his emergence in late May as a Duterte Supporter is Duterte's winning the elections.

Did Contreras believe, in a span of a few weeks, that Duterte has to ceased to be mabaho ang bunganga, pumapatay ng tao, corrupt, a liar, handang patayin ang kriminal kahit hindi sumailalim (sa due process), no better than a thief, an evil human, a defiler, ulyanin, and Dudirty anymore just because Duterte won?

ThinkingPinoy found it hilarious that Contreras had the gall to write in his 26 December 2017 Manila Times column, From being a platform to celebrate community that is otherwise divided by physical distance, social media has become a toxic domain for political contestations, when the fact of the matter is that he himself contributed to the toxicity that hes proselytizing against.

Heres a fair question:
If a Binay attempts to run again for president in 2022 against a Duterte-anointed candidate (e.g. Inday Sara, Marcos, or Cayetano), who would Contreras support?
Contreras very confidently preaches against fake followers and fake clout despite the fact that he's chummy with Ramirez, whose business as a PR operator involves exactly that. He even promotes Ramirez among his peers.

Evidence suggests that Contreras has serious integrity issues. All things considered, he is a likely first major candidate for Ramirezs would-be Facebook fleet, 

But one ship does not make a fleet, there has to be other ships in it.


A Christmas Gift
Evidence suggests that Ramirez may also have stricken a deal with another social media player with a considerable following on Facebook.

On 21 December 2017, Atty. Bruce Rivera tweeted Follow me @bruskoday [A] using his long-time Twitter handle @riverbrook930, which ThinkingPinoy found odd because Rivera already has 14,000 followers on @riverbrook930 and it takes a while to get as much followers on that platform. But whats more shocking is that Riveras new account @bruskoday [A] already has 85,400 followers despite having only 26 tweets, with the first tweet posted at 4:08 PM of 21 December 2017 [A].

Rivera promoting his new @bruskoday account using his old @riverbrook930 account.
Having such a follower count with so few tweets is virtually impossible to achieve, suggesting that Rivera must have inherited this account from someone else. Moreover, a closer look at the new twitter account shows that it was created in October 2010, making the account over seven years old.

That is, it appears that Rivera just inherited an account with many followers, scrubbed the old tweets, and changed the twitter handle from whatever it was to @bruskoday.

@Bruskodays original owner
Rivera inherited this account from someone else, but it would be tough to find out who it was because Rivera may have deleted all of @bruskodays older tweets.

Rivera, however, failed to delete the entries under the Likes tab, which can be found here. Eleven out of the 13 liked tweets [A] were from 2015, pre-dating Riveras 26 tweets that were all posted two years later in December 2017.

Here's a screenshot of the @bruskoday's entire ""Likes"" tab, click the image to zoom.

The Likes tab of Riveras new twitter account. Click to zoom.
A closer look at the tweets reveals a very interesting pattern. More specifically, lets examine 10 out of the 11 pre-2017 tweets one by one, starting with the oldest post.
1: Queen Latifah Show (@qlshow). Awh, @GabrielMacht, our hero! See how he's helping #ProjectWonderful: http://bit.ly/qlspwful @Suits_USA. 19 March 2014. 8:25 pm. Tweet.
Gabriel Macht of the TV series suits was an endorser of Globe Telecoms #ProjectWonderful program, according to a Globe Telecom press release. This is interesting because Joyce Ramirez was handling Globes PR at the time, as Ramirezs PR Asia Worldwide twitter account used describe itself as powered by Globe Telecom.

But one tweet is not enough, so lets check other liked tweets.
2: Marina Bay Sands (@marinabaysands). @PRAsiaWorldwide Thanks for being a top tweeter last night guys. 28 March 2014. 8:22 am.
Again, the @bruskoday liked a tweet from @PRAsiaWorldWide, Joyce Ramirezs firm.
3: Gabriel Macht (@GabrielMacht). Condolences to our friends in the Philippines @enjoyGLOBE for the passing of @dalekins - heard he was a huge SUITS fan. RIP. 10 July 2014. 6:28 pm. Tweet.
This third tweet, again, is by Gabriel Macht for Globe, one of Ramirezs clients.
4: Publicity Asia (@PRAsiaWorldwide). Belated HAPPY BIRTHDAY @GabrielMacht via @Suits_USA. 24 January 2015. Tweet.
Again, the @bruskoday liked a tweet from @PRAsiaWorldWide, Joyce Ramirezs firm.

Dissecting more liked tweets
Now, it gets more interesting after I saw the following tweet:
5: Manila Bulletin News (@ManilaBulletin). DIGITAL5 Head @coachot launches #PUSO2019 campaign as well as new online shows for @TV5Manila. 08 July 2015. 11:27 am. Tweet.
The #PUSO2019 PR campaign is funded by Manny V. Pangilinans Group (TV5, Smart, etc), and handled by no other than Joyce Ramirez through her now-defunct company LiveNextPR, a sister company of PR AsiaWorldwide [A].

Bruskodays next three liked tweets are also contain the PR campaign hashtag #Puso2019.
6: GMA News Breaking (@GMANewsBreaking). #PUSO2019: Social media tapped to boost PHL bid to host FIBA World Cup. 07 July 2015. 8:41 PM. Tweet.
7: Pangilinan, M. (@iamMVP). Retweet if you think the Philippines should host the FIBA 2019 Basketball World Cup. 30 July 2015. 8:40 pm. Tweet.
8: Manzano, L (@luckymanzano). Let's support the Philippines @FIBA bid #PUSO2019 and bring basketball home!. 06 August 2015. 2:44 pm. Tweet.
For the 9th liked tweet, @bruskoday again liked a tweet from @PRAsiaWorldWide, Joyce Ramirezs firm.
9: Publicity Asia (@PRAsiaWorldwide). Check out the opulent 3 bedroom @RafflesMakati Presidential Suite @GabrielMacht stayed at - fit for a Harvey!. 16 March 2014. 10:13 PM. Tweet.
And @bruskoday liked another one.
10. Publicity Asia (@PRAsiaWorldWide). @JakeMcDorman You have what it takes to be the NEXT @prattprattpratt | Hang in there pal, you're a born star #LIMITLESS via @CBS. 30 September 2015. 8:38 pm. Tweet.
SIDE NOTE: PR industry sources indicated that the MVP group has already severed ties with Ramirez sometime after the #Puso2019 campaign.
Ten out of the 13 tweets Rivera liked are part of Joyce Ramirezs PR campaigns, heavily suggesting that the 85,400-follower @bruskoday twitter account, which apparently came of nowhere, was formerly owned by Ramirez.

That is, evidence suggests that Ramirez gave Rivera one of her high-follower count Twitter accounts, which theoretically boosts Riveras relatively weak Twitter presence.

And interestingly, Rivera yesterday shared a PR piece defending Joyce Ramirez as regards the #NasaanAngPangulo issue that ThinkingPinoy mentioned during #CocoyGate Senate Hearing.

 A screenshot of Rivera''s profile page, where he shared one of Ramirez's PR pieces.

Signs of an ongoing PR campaign
On 02 January 2017, International Relations scholar Sass Sasot wrote:
1 1/2 years na lang eh 2019 national election na. If you are a political operator, ngayon pa lang i-demolish mo na ang reputation ng makakalaban ng kandidato mo. Kasi, as Duterte's candidacy demonstrated, kung mas malapit sa election time ang demolition job, hindi ito magiging successful. So dapat you do it in advance like what the Yellowtards did to Binay.
Pero wait, bakit parang walang demolition job na nangyayari ngayon laban sa mga kakandidato sa 2019? Alam naman natin kung sino mga re-electionists at mga posibleng tatakbo from LP. Yet ang dini-demolish ngayon ay ang mga bloggers na merong clout sa social media. Bakit ang social media ang sinisira? Kasi, as Duterte's candidacy demonstrated, social media is a powerful antidote laban sa demolition job na gagawin ng kalaban through traditional media.
So kailangan pa bang i-memorize iyan mga political operators?
Putting this writer into a PR operators shoes, this post makes quite some sense.
While its true that the 2019 campaign season is near, the political landscape is so fluid that its hard to predict who will file certificates of candidacy, except for Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who has been campaigning since the PDP-Laban mass oathtaking in Cebu City a few months back.

PR companies are businesses, so its unwise for any online PR operator to attack potential clients at this point. Thus, this is the time to fortify their PR arsenal either by:

Acquiring allies among those with major online followings, or 
Destroying major social media players that may get in their way.

The previous sections of this article demonstrate the first tactic. Meanwhile, recent events on Facebook suggest that the second tactic is already in motion.

The Second Tactic
Like what Sasot said, the attacks on what is dubbed as the Blogger Wars are mostly directed against ThinkingPinoy and to a great extent, against Sass Rogando Sasot, whos heavily identified with the former. Along with Mocha Uson, the three enjoy the highest engagement rates among political bloggers in the Philippines today.

Suffice it to say, Uson, Sasot and ThinkingPinoy  commonly called the Big 3  with their respective massive engagement figures, are in prime positions to greatly shape the outcome of the upcoming national elections.


Uson, the biggest voice online in the 2015-2016 campaign season, has already definitively shown resistance to temptation by siding with Duterte, despite the fact that the latters biggest opponents had access to massive financial war chests. Moreover, Uson already has over five million followers, so that bringing her down will be too expensive, too risky, or downright impossible at the moment.

Mocha is too big and too entrenched to topple. Thus, any given PR operators logical Plan B would be to discredit the other two: ThinkingPinoy and Sasot.

Creating a Power Vacuum
While some simplistically view this phenomenon as a simple battle of fragile egos, its difficult to ignore the fact that those who most vehemently attack ThinkingPinoy and Sasot seem to have suddenly and entirely forgotten to criticize politicians.

The two publish expos after expos about criminality, incompetence, and government corruption, even those happening within some factions of the Duterte Government itself, with some of their material used as resources for NBI and Senate Investigations. Meanwhile, erstwhile online political commentators have apparently forgotten to do the same as they focus all their energies at bringing the two down.

This makes perfect sense from a PR standpoint, as destroying the two will create a power vacuum that, to a limited extent, similar to the one created right after then presidential frontrunner Binays fall from grace during the past administration.

If and when ThinkingPinoy and Sasot lose their respective voices, then it becomes a free-for-all battle for influence thats akin to mid-2015, when all social media entities pretty much enjoyed a level playing field as they jostle for a larger piece of the influence pie.

There are two possible outcomes in a post-Big 3 scenario where only Uson survives.

First, the ensuing power vacuum will be filled and dominated by a few other players.
If the replacements have strong links with a PR operator such as Joyce Ramirez, then it's a win for the PR operator. If not, then either  ""operate"" against the new replacement until an influencer-ally takes the spot or  settle for the new status quo if the new replacement cannot rival the engagement figures of traditional media outlets, because the PR operator already has access to traditional media outlets to begin with.
Second, the ensuing power vacuum left by the two will occupied evenly by the same attacking players, or even none of them.
This is also a very interesting scenario because this will dilute Facebooks ability to shape the 2019 elections itself. With no major player that can rival traditional media companies, then the Philippines is back to a pre-2016 elections scenario where campaigns are dictated by who the major networks, major broadsheets, and major radio stations choose support.
An interesting 2018
ThinkingPinoy still has his well-founded doubts on whether these attacks will be effective, as the attackers generally do not exercise the same kind of rigor in the materials they publish, aside from the fact that many of these attackers possess very recently uncovered political baggage that may not fade from public consciousness anytime soon.

Nevertheless, ThinkingPinoy admits uncertainty as to whether he or Sasot will survive this nonstop onslaught. Regardless, the political observer in him is delighted to witness these events first-hand.

ThinkingPinoy will continue to write articles of national significance as long as he can.

However, should this brouhaha eventually spell the end of ThinkingPinoys relatively short-lived political blogging career, he sincerely wishes to thank all his followers for being with him in this very enjoyable ride. Maybe it's time to ""retire""?

Whichever way the wind will blow, having the rare opportunity to reach out to millions over a span of two years isn't bad at all.

Many people do not get that chance, so even if ThinkingPinoy loses what he has right now, he remains forever grateful that he had it for a little while.",RJ Nieto,"January 3, 2018",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2018/01/an-ex-roxas-pr-ladys-journey-from.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#DengGate: PNoy, Garin, Abad, Padilla almost bankrupted PhilHealth","Let's start with a recap of bad news after bad news.

It all started with #DengGate: Aquinos Garin ignores WHO warning, where I explained how the Aquino Government, disregarding warnings from experts, hastily misappropriated Php 3.5 billion in public funds for purchasing untested dengue Vaccines and administering them to over 700,000 Filipino fourth graders, unnecessarily putting their lives in danger.

The Health Department swiftly attempted to allay fears when newly-installed Secretary Francisco Duque said theres a 30-month protective period starting from the first dose, suggesting that victims still have time to prepare for when the real risk for severe dengue kicks in.

Unfortunately, that 30-month protective period has been debunked in #DengGate: Kid in ICU for dengue only 3 months after 3rd dose. Worse, it appears that officials within the Department of Health itself are trying to mount a massive coverup, as shown in #DengGate: Botched Tarlac Dengvaxia case hints DoH-led coverup.

Public exasperation over this health debacle can better be described with #DengGate: A Dengvaxia Victims mother writes to Health Sec. Duque, where a mother of a Dengvaxia victim appealed to the government for the sake of her child. With the protective period turning out to be a myth and with hundreds of thousands of parents worried, what should be done?

In #DengGate: Dear Mr. President, heres the memo you asked for, I explained the situation to President Duterte, who appears to be surrounded by health advisers that harbor serious conflicts of interest. In that memo, I suggested that de-escalation through information dissemination, i.e. informing parents about what can be done, should be the first thing the current government must do.

But the Health Departments suggestion  consulting doctors  is too expensive for many of the victims, whose parents earn less than US$10 a day, so we must tap our network of government health centers for information dissemination.

However, in last weeks #DengGate: Garins P4.8-billion botched, overpriced Health Center Project, I explained how the Aquino Government, through Budget Secretary Florencio Butch Abad, Health Secretary Janette Garin, and PhilHealth CEO Alexander Alex Padilla, illegally siphoned off Php 10.6 billion pesos in PhilHealth funds to bankroll a multi-billion-peso massively overpriced health center project thats just 10% complete almost a year after its oft-extended deadline.
Yes, the previous government even tinkered with health centers, leaving almost 1,000 villages in the affected regions without a health center for the next decade or so.

Again, the story started with the Php 3.5-billion illegal purchase of defective vaccines, which evolved in what appears to be a massive government-led coverup. The story further included another Php 4.8-billion corruption scandal involving health centers.

The deeper I dug, the bigger worms I discovered... and here, my friends, are more worms.


Malversation of P10.6 billion in PhilHealth Funds
The Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010 [RA 9994] provides free medical insurance coverage to senior citizens, defined as Filipinos aged 60 and above, made possible by a combination of the Sin Tax Law [RA 10351] and [RA 10645].

Let me explain that more clearly. After deducting the small share of tobacco farmers, 80% of Sin Taxes (taxes levied on Liquor and Tobacco) go to PhilHealth. Furthermore, RA 10645 requires a part of that 80% to be reserved for the cost of PhilHealth coverage for Filipino seniors.

Php 10.6 billion from sin taxes was supposedly allocated for senior citizens for the year 2015. However, in an August 2015 letter to Department of Budget and Management Secretary Butch Abad, Health Secretary Janette Garin and PhilHealth CEO Alexander Padilla said PhilHealth doesnt need the money anymore, that PhilHealth can cover all seniors even without the Php 10.6 billion from sin tax.

Garin also sits as PhilHealths chairman of the board at the time, by virtue of her being the Secretary of Health.
With this premise, Padilla and Garin asked Abad to realign the Php 10.6 billion towards the Department of Healths Health Facilities Enhancement Program, with about half of the amount (Php 5.3-billion) earmarked for the botched school-based barangay health center construction project.
Garin and Padilla's letter to Abad.

The 2015 realignment, in itself, is already illegal per a February 2015 Supreme Court decision on the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) [SC GR 209287].

But theres a bigger problem: Padilla and Garin, as agents of Philhealth, let go of the massive Php 10.6-billion subsidy despite the fact that PhilHealth was struggling to pay claims of senior citizen members, and despite the fact that PhilHealth, as a whole, was on the verge of bankruptcy.


PhilHealth reserve funds drying up
In 10 March 2016, PhilHealth board member Eddie Dorotan said the company may go bankrupt by the end of the year as claims payments exceed members contributions and income [BicolToday].

PhilHealth President and CEO Alexander Padilla contradicted Dorotans statement on the same day, arguing that PhilHealths reserve funds has been growing steadily from about Php 112 billion in 2012 to Php 128 billion in 2015 [CNN].

ThinkingPinoy, through sources within PhilHealth, obtained copies of PhilHealth board presentations that detailed the true financial position of the government corporation.

Based on these documents, Padilla failed to disclose the amount that PhilHealth pays out, which would have put the reserve amount into perspective. That is, Php 128 billion in reserves appears to be a very large amount, but its easily overwhelmed by the exponential growth of claims payments compared to the linear (and plateauing growth of premium collections.

Moreover, while its true that PhilHealths reserve fund is increasing, much of it is not liquid enough to address immediate financial needs. That is, readily available reserve funds are dwindling and are projected to dwindle further, as PhilHealth posts massive operating losses every year.

According to a [PhilHealth board presentation] delivered in early 2017:

Readily available reserve funds dwindle year after year.
Padilla and Garin, the top two PhilHealth officials at the time, turned a blind eye on this reality.


An impending bankruptcy
In the 11 February 2016 presentation PhilHealth: Plugging the Holes, PhilHealth Independent Director Anthony Leachon cited Fund Balance Projections as valuated in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Screenshots of the these projections are show below:

2012 Valuation

2013 Valuation

2014 Valuation
As we can see, all of the three valuations predict that PhilHealth will run out of reserves by mid-2018, as total expenses increase exponentially and projected income increasing linearly (and plateauing).

Simply put, all three projections indicate that Philhealth will be BANKRUPT by mid-2018.

Again, these projections were made in 2012, 2013, and 2014, meaning that they were readily available to Health Secretary and PhilHealth chair Garin and PhilHealth CEO Padilla. With that said, how on earth did these two manage to claim that PhilHealth can operate WITHOUT the Php 10.6 billion subsidy from sin taxes, the same Php 10.6 billion that they gave away to the Health Department?

Sources from within PhilHealth informed me that Garin met with DBM to discuss PhilHealths finances WITHOUT any other representative from PhilHealth, may that be someone from the actuarial department, the benefits committee, or the risk management committee.

Garin and Padilla didnt care about PhilHealths survival: it appears that all they wanted to do with PhilHealth is milk it for all its worth. And in this particular case, Garin, Padilla, and Abad had their eyes set on the Php 10.6 billion for PhilHealths senior citizen beneficiaries.

Risa Hontiveros and her PhilHealth Ads
As a side note, its comical that then PhilHealth director and current Senator Risa Hontiveros had the gall to take advantage of what little money PhilHealth has to advertise for her 2016 senatorial bid, with some of Hontiveross Philhealth TV commercials costing Php 400,000 per 30-second spot. If she indeed cared for the poor, she would have had the delicadeza to beg off, but she did not.

PhilHealth spent millions for this ad campaign and Hontiveros was fine with it, despite her full knowledge that PhilHealth is broke.
I think her participation in the ad campaign squarely violates 3 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act [RA 3019], which prohibits public officials from:
Directly or indirectly becoming interested, for personal gain... in any transaction or act requiring the approval of a board... of which he is a member, and which exercises discretion in such approval, even if he votes against the same or does not participate in the action of the board...
Given this, Hontiveros August 2015 excuse  that she didnt ask for it  wont fly.

Php 10.6-billion for Seniors, gone
Recall that in the 05 August 2015 letter, Padilla argued that PhilHealth can cover senior citizens even without the Php 10.6-billion subsidy from sin taxes.

Padilla was lying. According to another [PhilHealth board presentation] delivered in early 2017, PhilHealth needed Php 2.1 billion to cover senior citizens in 2014, and another Php 13 billion in 2015, for a total of Php 15 billion as of the end of 2015.

Adding the fact that fund reserve projections of the past three years strongly suggest impending bankruptcy, how could Padilla and Garin conclude that PhilHealth can live without the Php 10.6 billion sin tax subsidy?

Well, it seems that the Aquino Administration planned it from the very start.

In 2014, President Aquino issued a veto message for the 2015 National Budget. Part of the message reads:
With respect to senior citizen beneficiaries, the provisions of R.A. No. 10645 (Expanded Senior Citizens Act) shall be funded through the Unprogrammed Fund [Gazette].
In short, Aquino didnt want Congress to hard-code the Php 10.6 billion for PhilHealth and instead insisted that the fund be classified as unprogrammed. This makes budget realignments easier to do from a legal standpoint, i.e. the Aquino Government had plans for the fund in as early as 2014.

And just to give the reader some perspective:
Janet Napoles PDAF Scam involves Php 10-billion in public funds [SunStar]. This one is 600 million pesos more than that.
I have reason to believe that this Php 10.6-billion PhilHealth scam is more than just a simple case of Technical Malversation, as the entire issue appears to been heavily pre-meditated, as evidenced by Aquinos 2014 veto message.

Weakness then Magic
This is made possible through a weakness of the Sin Tax Law, which allows for the soft earmarking for health expenses during national budget deliberations, as opposed to programmed funding or mandatory allocations that would have made realignments harder to perform.

Specifically, Kaiser et Al.s Sin Tax Reform in the Philippines: Transforming Public Finance, Health, and Governance for More Inclusive Development [Kaiser 2016] states:


The earmarking of Sin Tax Law (STL) revenues is soft earmarking, though STL revenues are allocated through the annual budgeting process, and annual allocations are considered simultaneously with the overall budgets of the government agencies concerned.

In short, this legal weakness paved the way for budgetary magic.

I guess we should stop wondering why Garin and Padilla defied logic as they requested for the realignment: they had to do it no matter what, because Aquino and Abad were very much interested in it all along.

And we all know where half of the illegally realigned Php 10.6-billion went: to the botched, overpriced, and unfinished health center construction project. As for the other half, I still do not know.

But now that Ive talked about corruption in public healthcare, I might as well take a birds eye view of the matter and investigate other corrupt practices in PhilHealth and the Department of Health.

Sin Taxes and the Richest Secretary
Politicians have historically abused PDAF (Pork Barrel) Funds for their own benefit, and this was the most popular  and most lucrative  avenue for corruption for a long time. The Supreme Court, however, effectively stopped this practice when it declared PDAF unconstitutional in November 2013 [SC GR 208566], as private citizens filed cases questioning its legality in the aftermath of the Janet Napoles PDAF Scam.

With no PDAF to take advantage of, corrupt politicians had to look elsewhere and they found sin taxes. But one cant just steal money straight from sin taxes: theres an art to it.

As explained in earlier sections, sin taxes are taxes levied on liquor and tobacco products. After tobacco farmers get their small share per statutory provisions, 80% of the remainder goes to PhilHealth while the rest goes to the Department of Health.

Anyone knowledgeable with PhilHealths finances will agree that Sin Taxes saved PhilHealth. What many may not be aware of, however, is the magnitude of liquidity that Sin Taxes provided not only to PhilHealth, but the Department of Health as well.

Enacted in 2012, the Philippine Sin Tax Law astronomically increased the Health Budget. DoH, which had an average annual budget of Php 30-billion from 2009-2012, suddenly enjoyed an average annual budget of Php 87-billion from 2013-2016. In 2016, DoH had Php 122.6 billion, or thrice its 2012 budget of Php 42-billion.


Simply put, sin taxes made the Health Secretary the richest secretary in the Cabinet.

And where theres money, theres corruption.


Worse than you thought
The first thing that probably came to your mind would be the PhilHealth cards that politicians typically give away to their constituents as a form of patronage politics, where would-be voters mistakenly feel the need to support a given politician in order to receive government benefits.

Thats right. That happens. But theres something far more sinister than that.


In late July 2015, Philhealth issued [Circular No. 018-2015], which basically limits eye doctors to 50 cataract claims per month. This was after Philhealth discovered that doctors have been abusing PhilHealth as they claimed large numbers of bogus cataract surgeries in order to collect benefit claims.

PhilHealth pays Php 16,000 per cataract surgery, an outpatient procedure that lasts only 15 minutes. According to highly-placed sources within PhilHealth, some doctors performed cataract surgeries even on patients with no cataracts, while some charged PhilHealth even without operating on anyone at all.

In early July 2015, for example, 10 doctors claimed Php 500 million in total from PhilHealth [Star], 9 of them being eye doctors. For 2014, PhilHealth paid P2-billion in cataract claims alone [PhilHealth]. Thats about 125,000 cataract procedures!

It would have been great if PhilHealth gets to catch abusive doctors, but the sad reality is that extensive audits, which allow PhilHealth to detect fraud, are done mostly in NCR hospitals, so that provincial hospitals can still get away with it.

Philhealth's Sin Tax Fund as the new PDAF
But the story doesnt end there: some high-ranking health officials informed me that local politicians conspire with doctors to defraud PhilHealth, and it appears that PhilHealths past administration didnt mind that much. For example, the top conditions and procedures paid for by [PhilHealth] in 2014 are:

Pneumonia: Php 7.6-billion
Hemodialysis: Php 4.6-billion
Caesarian Delivery: Php 7.6-billion
Cataract Removal: Php 2-billion
Maternity Care Package: Php 1.5-billion

Now, add the fact that Philhealth paid Php 78-billion more in 2014 than it did in 2013, a 41% increase. While increases may be attributed to increased coverage, such a drastic increase in such a short span of time suggests that theres something fishy going on.

According to PhilHealth sources, many doctors and their politician business partners have started to either  prescribe unnecessary procedures or  claim ghost procedures, in order to increase their claims. And it also helps that local politicians control local arms of the Department of Health, while others actually own hospitals.


For example, a number of major eye clinics actually have politicians as co-investors.

But some corrupt politicians take it a step further.

In Tarlac Province, for example, Governor Vic Yap in 2015 withheld professional fees of government doctors at the Tarlac Provincial Hospital (TPH) [Inq], an issue that has yet to resolved up to this day. TPH has been losing doctors left and right since then [Inq].

So where did the withheld money go? Take a guess.

Have we seen any investigation conducted by Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales that actually yielded something? No, but thats expected, as Morales appears to be one of the staunchest protectors of the Aquinos [TP: Mamasapano Trojan Horse].

The list of corrupt practices goes on, and on, and on.

Remember that PhilHealth alone receives over P35-billion in sin tax subsidies annually: that's Php 35-billion to play with each year [BW].

PhilHealths Woes
To cut the long story short, corruption and fraud almost brought PhilHealth into a downward spiral into bankruptcy. Despite this, Health Sec. Garin and PhilHealth CEO Padilla still insisted that PhilHealth can live without the Php 10.6 billion sin tax subsidy.

Whats so special about that amount?

Heres one possible explanation:
Funneling Php 10.6-billion to local hospitals means Garin and Padilla get a cut only after the local politicians get theirs. However, if Php 10.6-billion is awarded to just a few entities for a national-level contract, such as the botched Php 4.8 health center project, then they can possibly get a bigger cut.
Good thing Roxas lost 2016. Otherwise,  PhilHealth will be gone in just a year or two.

Through the General Appropriations act, the Duterte Administration reportedly extended to PhilHealth a Php 36-billion lifeline to keep the state insurance company alive, and steps are being taken to fix its finances.

But what happens after Duterte's term? Will PhilHealth go back to the way it was?

Lots of corruption happens in PhilHealth and the rest of the public healthcare system, and I think President Duterte has a long way to go in as far as cleaning the PhilHealth and the DoH.

Sin Taxes are intended not just to provide token coverage: it's intended to provide the best quality healthcare to Filipinos that the country can afford. If there's no corruption in Public Healthcare, we can actually afford a lot, lot more.

But as the saying goes, every journey starts with one step, so let the first step be an investigation against Padilla, Garin, Abad, and Aquino, for conspiring to defraud our senior citizens.

Oh, and another against Senator Risa Hontiveros too, for committing graft.

"#DengGate: Garins P4.8-billion botched, overpriced Health Center Project","You thought P3.5-B was bad? Well, here's one for P4.8-B!

On 07 December 2017, the World Health Organization Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety published a statement in reference to Sanofis Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) [WHO], the defective drug that was injected to over 830,000 Filipino 4th graders through an ill-conceived Aquino Government-sponsored mass vaccination program [TP: Mr. President]. According the statement:
In study subjects of (2-16 years of age) without prior dengue infection, data suggest modest efficacy (15%-32%) of vaccine against symptomatic dengue until the second year of follow up. Subsequently, starting during year 3, the risk of hospitalized and severe illness becomes higher than among controls.
Lets translate this into simple English:
Those who have never had dengue and were given Dengvaxia are provided a 15%-32% resistance from severe dengue for two years after getting the first dose. After that, the risk for severe dengue becomes higher compared to those who werent vaccinated.
What does this mean?

First, there is virtually no protective period, contrary to what local authorities say.
WHO clearly stated that Dengvaxia does not provide immunity from Severe Dengue in any way, shape, or form for those who have never had dengue before (seronegative). Instead, Dengvaxia provides resistance against severe dengue for the first 24 months, a 15-32% resistance which can best be described as minimal.
This WHO statement squarely contradicts Health Secretary Duques earlier claim that first dose provides a 30-month protective period [FB]. Where did Sec. Duque get his numbers, from Sanofi? I dont know, but one things clear: Sec. Duque does not completely understand what hes talking about.

Second, a seronegative recipient is more likely to get severe dengue 24 months after initial dose, compared to seronegative individuals who never received Dengvaxia.
I think I do not need to explain this second point anymore.

Doctors out of reach
While there seems to be a general consensus that much of the kids inoculated with Dengvaxia are seropositive, the fact remains that no mass testing was done prior to the mass vaccination program. That is, its virtually impossible to pinpoint who among the over 830,000 recipients are seronegative.

Parents of Dengvaxia recipients need to be educated about these things as soon as possible. They should be taught about what can be done for now, what to expect after the 24-month period, and what to do if and when their child contracts Dengvaxia-assisted Severe Dengue.


Consulting a doctor as soon as possible is probably the best way for parents to get some peace of mind. However, the country suffers a shortage of 15,000 doctors, with only 1 doctor per 33,000 Filipinos [CNN]. 

Moreover, visits to the doctor is out of reach for many, with one EU-funded study showing that each outpatient visit costing Php 378 on the average [Tsilaajav 2009], roughly equivalent to one entire days wage for workers in Central Luzon, NCR, Central Visayas, and Calabarzon [PSA], the regions where mass vaccinations took place.

Add the fact that public school children typically come from poor families make medical consultations out of reach for a vast majority of the victims.

But surely, educating the parents of Dengvaxia victims can be done through health centers, right?

We have barangay health centers, right?

Well, not exactly.

Graft and Corruption: 3.5 then 4.8
In line with the graft complaint arising from the Php 3.5 billion mass vaccination program, Department of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre issued yesterday an Immigration Lookout Bulletin Order [DoJ] against the top officials of the Aquino Administration and the contractor Sanofi.

According to Aguirre, these persons may have violated the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act [RA 3019] for participating in the P3.5 billion Dengvaxia deal, despite alleged lack of comprehensive study on the effectivity (sic) and risks of the vaccines.

Yes, the P3.5-billion Dengvaxia Deal seems anomalous in itself, but what make matters worse is that one of the temporary solutions to the Dengvaxia mess  Barangay Health Centers  is mired in an even big controversy a controversy to the tune of P4.8 billion pesos.

Helping Dengvaxia victims made more difficult
Barangay Health Centeres are probably the most effective tools to educate the public about Dengvaxia, to tell them about what to expect, and to teach them how to prepare for whatever those expectations are. Unfortunately, out of the 42,000 barangays in the country, less than half have such facilities.

In an apparent attempt to address this shortage, the Department of Health in 2015 launched a massive P4.8-billion program to construct 3,200 Barangay Health Stations throughout the country, more commonly known as School-based Barangay Health Stations.

I got hold of 27 October 2017 DoH report about this ambitious project. Written by Dr. David Lozada Jr, the document entitled Procurement of the Construction of BHS Tsekup in 3,200 Public School Sites chronicles the project developments from the date of the projects inception. Unless otherwise mentioned, this document serves as the basis for everything stated in this article. The complete report is embedded below:

At first glance, the reasoning behind the program is generally sound: build health centers, which will also double as school clinics, on school grounds to avoid land ownership issues, among other reasons.

The government allocated Php 4.8 billion for the project, with the winning bidder JBros Construction offering to do it for Php 4.45 billion. Awarded in December 2015, JBros was supposed to complete all 3,200 Barangay Health Centers by September 2016.
As of August 2017, however, the contractor managed to complete only 338 Barangay Health Centers, or just a little over 10% of the 3,200 promised, with no signs of it completing the remaining 90% anytime soon.

About a third of the 3,200  1,051  are supposed to be built in Regions 3, NCR, 4A, and 7, or the four regions where mass anti-dengue immunization programs took place. Of this number, the contractor managed to complete only 239. That is, at least 812 barangays from Dengvaxia-affected regions will not have Barangay Health Centers.

Incompetence would be the knee-jerk explanation for this mess.

A deeper look, however, reveals a very different, and more tragic story.

An even bigger SARO
Department of Budget and Management Sec. Butch Abad released the infamous Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) for Dengvaxia worth Php 3.5 billion on 29 December 2015. What many seemed to have overlooked, however, is the release of an even bigger SARO, one for Php 9.4 billion, to fund the Department of Healths Health Facilities Enhancement Program (HFEP).

This SARO was issued upon the request of Health Sec. Garin:

According to the Php 9.4 billion SARO:
Php 5.36 billion goes to capital outlays for hospitals and health centers, 
Php 3.39 billion goes to procuring medical equipment, and 
Php 639 million goes to purchasing motor vehicles
I am uncertain as to where the P3.39 billion and P639 million chunks went and I can do little about that given available data. However, I have more than enough information about Php 5.36 billion for hospitals and health centers, where P4.8 billion was allocated for the construction of Barangay Health Centers.

Congress obviously didnt provide a budget for the construction of Health Centers in 2015, thats why the Php 9.4 billion SARO had to be issued. Despite this, the Department of Health started the procurement process on 25 June 2015 and it found a qualified bidder by 09 September 2015, all these in spite of the lack of funding for the project.

How can the government bid out a massive Php 4.4 billion contract if it doesnt even have the money for it?

Thats illegal, but why did Garin still choose to do it?

Well, Aquino and Abad already had a plan in as early as 2015: to get money from the funds for Philhealth coverage for senior citizens, as fund that was mandated by the Expanded Senior Citizens Act, a fund that is expressly stated by Law to be spent for that purpose and that purpose alone.

I will explain how Abad and PNoy bastardized Philhealth through this SARO in another article. For now, lets focus on the health centers because this issue in itself is already ridden with so many irregularities, one ThinkingPinoy article may not even be enough to explain it.
Budget Sec. Abad issued the Php 9.4-billion SARO despite full knowledge that its illegal per a February 2015 Supreme Court ruling against the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP), and I have reason to believe that Abad was intent on violating the law from the very start.

In 2014, President Aquinos issued a veto message for the 2015 National Budget.

Part of that veto message reads:
With respect, however, to senior citizen beneficiaries, the provisions of R.A. No. 10645 (Expanded Senior Citizens Act), shall be applied, taking into consideration those already covered under the National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) The additional beneficiaries authorized under these provisions shall be funded through the Unprogrammed Fund. In all instances, the implementing agencies shall ensure that no overlapping of beneficiaries under the NHIP takes place The DOH and DSWD shall issue the guidelines to further clarify the foregoing conditions and ensure the successful implementation of the expanded NHIP under these provisions [Gazette].
In simpler terms, Aquino said he will determine how much Philhealth needs from the P10.6-billion fund instead of simply giving Philhealth the entire amount, arguing that there may be an overlapping of beneficiaries.

Setting up the stage
In short, Aquino set the stage for the manipulation of the P10.6 billion fund, a fund that Aquino later used to illegally fund the health center contract.

ThinkingPinoy acquired a copy of a Philhealth board presentation from a senior Philhealth official whose identity shall be withheld for his or her safety. The presentation may be found here.

According to Philhealth, Php 10.6 billion from sin taxes collected in 2014 was supposed to partially pay for the over P12.15 billion that Philhealth owed various healthcare establishments as of 2015, in accordance with the law, which mandates free Philhealth coverage for all senior citizens [RA 10645].

The law, again, is clear: P10.6 billion goes to Philhealth for senior citizens, period.

And rightly so, because according to a confidential document that ThinkingPinoy obtained from a highly-placed source in Philhealth, the state medical insurance company owed hospitals over Php 15-billion as of 2015, so that the Php 10.6 billion could have reduced those arrears by two-thirds.

Source: Philhealth
But President Aquino thought otherwise.

On 05 August 2015, Health Sec. Garin and Philhealth CEO Alexander Padilla wrote to Budget Sec. Abad, informing the latter that Philhealth can provide coverage to senior citizens without having to touch the P10.6 billion funds. Moreover, Garin and Padilla requested Abad to realign the P10.6 billion towards the construction of Health Centers.
Letter to DBM Sec. Abad from Health Sec. Garin and Philhealth CEO Padilla
We all know that Philhealth has always had financial issues so its confusing to see a Philhealth CEO telling DBM that they have enough money.
SIDE NOTE: Alex Padilla is currently one of Senator Leila de Lima's legal counsels.
A day later, Garin sent Abad a letter detailing the proposed breakdown of the prospective SARO.


Isn't it amazing how Garin's ""needs"" match Philhealth's Php 10.6 billion up to the last cent?


Contract Award
The Php 9.4 billion SARO was issued on 29 December 2015.

December 30 (Rizal Day) and December 31st (last day of the year) were holidays, so Garin had less than 8 work-hours to award the contract. But if theres a will, theres a way: Garin managed to award, at lightning speed, a P4.4 billion to JBros Construction, the winning bidder for the school-based health center contract.

SOURCE: Usec. David Lozada's report to the DOH dated 27 October 2017

The contract was signed by Health Sec. Garin and JBros Constructions Abelardo Balota, with the contract agreement executed a few weeks later on 22 January 2016 (CA No. GOP-C-2015-042), for the amount of Php 4,456,592,239.41.

The required time of completion was 240 calendar days, with Notice to Proceed (NTP) dated 22 January 2016, i.e. all 3,200 health centers must be completed by 28 October 2016.
Irregularities, irregularities, irregularities

At this point, its already clear that the funding for the massive health center construction program was illegally obtained. Unfortunately, that isnt the only thing irregular about this contract.

1: The Cost
The Php 4.45 billion contract is for the construction of 3,200 health centers, so thats about Php 1.4 million per Health Center. Thats pretty hefty, especially since only 52 of the 3200 health centers are in NCR, and the contractor doesnt even have to purchase land, as the structures will be built inside schools, i.e. DepEd property.

The contract states each of the 3,200 buildings will be 6 meters by 7 meters, i.e. each has a floor area of 42 square meters. Dividing Php 1392685.07 by 42 sq. m., we get Php 33,159 per sqm. Php 33,159 is about thrice the average cost of non-residential construction, which is Php 10,265 as of 2014.

Moreover, each health center will be built with steel sandwich panels, i.e. two thin layers of steel with foam insulation at the core, similar to buildings made from container vans. That is, the buildings are supposed to be a lot cheaper than concrete buildings, but it isnt the case.

Each completed health center will not be very different from this container building.
In short, the buildings under this contract appear to be substandard and severely overpriced.

2: A last-minute MoA
Sec. Garin gave the contractor a Notice to Proceed on 22 January 2016, i.e. JBros Construction was supposed to start constructing the 3,200 health centers right away.

However, its confusing for me to discover that DoH signed a Memorandum of Agreement with DoH and DILG only on 26 January 2016, or four days after the Notice to Proceed. For example, the Department of Education issued relevant orders to public schools via DepEd Memorandum No. 27 s. 2016 only 17 February 2016, or almost one month after the Notice to Proceed.

The Aquino government was in a rush to allocate the funds even if the project was still -- and is still -- half-baked.
To make matters more complicated, Garin awarded the contract even BEFORE the 3,200 construction sites were validated, as evidenced by the DepEd memo instructing school division superintendents to conduct validation of schools to check if theres buildable space.

3: Non-buildable Construction Sites
As it turns out, a lot of the proposed construction sites cannot be used. Among the reasons are  unavailable space,  space reserved for a future classroom,  flood prone area,  existing barangay health cente , construction declined by school principal.

However, among the many reasons cited in the October 2017 report, the funniest would be:

(School) is not operational due to lahar.
Yes, some of the schools in the 3,200-strong list do not even exist anymore!

Some of the construction sites are UNDERNEATH lahar.
Yes, the Aquino Government awarded a multi-billion-peso construction contract even if it isnt even sure if construction can be performed in the first place.

Garin, Abad, and Padilla, were so desperate to get hold of the Php 10.6 billion Philhealth Funds, which would have been inaccessible if they tried to get it in 2016.

4: A very sneaky price increase
Just when we thought that the proposed school-based barangay health centers were already overpriced, the contractor issued a Variation Order (price increase request) for Php 416.5 million, which was approved by no other Health Sec. Garin on 30 June 2016, or the last day of Aquino Administration.

Let me put this particular item into perspective:
The Government supposedly allocated Php 4.8 billion for the contract. But to theoretically provide the best deal for the government, the contract was still bid out. JBros bid Php 4.4 billion, which appears that the government saved Php 400 millionbut JBros increased the bid to P4.8 billion after contract award AND GARIN APPROVED IT.
Why did even bother bidding it out if we will max out the budget anyway?

Worse, the Php 416.5 million variation order would have put the total contract price at Php 4.873 billion, which EXCEEDS the approved budget for just Php 4.8 billion by a whopping Php 73 million!

Despite the Variation Order being illegal, Garin still approved it.

5: Extension after extension
The Notice to Proceed was issued in January 2016 but the start date was revised to March 2016 because DoHs agreement with DILG and DepEd came in late, so that the target completion date was moved to October 2016. The target completion date was further moved to January 2017, then it was further moved to July 2017.

SOURCE: Usec. David Lozada's report to the DOH dated 27 October 2017

What we see here is a very poorly planned project whose contract was rushed to meet the December 2015 deadline for DAP Funds. That is, the Aquino Government didnt mind the fact that the project will experience massive problems, as long as they can release the Php 10.6 billion from Philhealth.

How corruption happens
The Department of Health under the Duterte Administration is seriously mulling the termination of the contract, though it appears that the contractor is resisting the plan. Why is the contractor intent on continuing despite the myriad logistical, legal, and financial problems hounding the contract?

Theres something fishy going on.

Highly placed government sources told me that contractors typically pay kickbacks shortly after a contract is awarded. That is, contractors pay corrupt officials even before they actually get paid for the contract. That is, they told me that its not unlikely that the contractor may have already paid Garin, Abad, and Padilla their respective shares. That is, if the Duterte Government terminates the contract, the contractor may not be able to recover the amount it already paid to the officials of the previous administration.

Just a about 300 of the proposed 3,200 health centers have been completed as of August 2017.
So much, exactly, did Garin, Abad, Padilla earn from the health center contract?

Let the NBI check that out.

Missing Health Centers
Graft and corruption is a serious issue in itself, but we cant ignore an even bigger problem arising from this mess: the non-existent Health Centers.

The Duterte Government has two possible courses of action:  let construction continue, i.e. allow the contractor to build overpriced and substandard health centers, or  terminate the contract.

What to do? What to do?
I believe that the first option is not viable as that may be tantamount to the current government being complicit with the abuses of the past administration, and this leaves us with second option, which is to terminate the contract.

However, terminating the contract will inevitably lead to lawsuit, and its a question on which among the contractor and the Department of Health will be the plaintiff and the defendant.

This prospective court case will most likely drag on for years because  the government never settles cases and  the courts are widely known to be ridiculously slow in resolving cases, with cases of this magnitude typically dragging on for ten years or more.
SIDE NOTE: If I were to put myself in the contractors shoes, Id simply file a case to get a Temporary Restraining Order, wait for a few years for Duterte to step down, make sure a Liberal Party-aligned president takes over, then ask the new LP-led administration to proceed with the contract.
There is a pressing need for more health centers because of the Dengvaxia scandal, health centers that worried parents can go to for crucial health information.

With this botched P4.8-billion contract, however, we can look forward to about 3,000 barangays with no health centers for the next ten years or more, with about a third located in the regions where mass immunizations took place.

But the story doesnt end there.

Cryptocurrencies, in simple terms, are digital currencies that are free from control by any single central bank. I will not go into the details of how cryptocurrencies work.

The most popular cryptocurrency right now is Bitcoin. Aside from Bitcoin there are other cryptocurrencies that are gaining wide acceptance. With that said, this article focuses specifically on Noah Coin (also called Noakoin), a cryptocurrency that, according to its website, will be launched on 12 June 2018.

According to NoahCoin.org:
The main market for NOAH COIN consists of OFWs (Overseas Filipino Workers). It is a promising method for Filipino workers who have gone overseas to earn income for their families to use when sending money back home, and the size of this market has risen to three trillion yen.
NOTE: JPY 3 trillion is roughly equal to US$26 billion using current exchange rates.

We clearly see that Noah Coins main market is the OFW population, and that its primary purpose is for overseas remittance.

A screenshot of NoahCoin.org
According to the same site, Noah Coin is a project of the Philippines-based Noah Foundation, and that part of the earnings from Noah Coin transaction fees will be used to fund Noah Foundations charitable work.

Sounds like a good idea! After all, an impoverished country like the Philippines can benefit from another charitable foundation on its shores.

Whos behind Noah Coin?
Noah Foundations Noah Coins is, for the most part, a low-cost remittance service that mainly targets OFWs. And just like any other newly-introduced remittance service, I felt it proper to check the reputation of the people behind it.

Noah Coins website (NCW) lists six  key people, which it calls the Noah Foundation Team:

A screenshot of ""Noah Foundation Team"".
1. Executive / Lawyer, Bruce Rivera, Chief legal advisor for the Duterte presidential family of the Philippines. Graduate of the San Beda Graduate School of Law.

2. Chief Technological Officer David Mezrahid, a cryptocurrency lecturer at Princeton University. Also active as a private banker in Monaco.


3. Chief Director Clarke Robertson, a CTO of a number of companies based in London. Active as a systems architect skilled in infrastructure development and network platform design.

4. Executive Martin Salvador, CEO of Ark Technology Co., Ltd. Holds over 20 years of experience in project management spanning a number of different languages.

5. Robbie Antonio, Supervisor of NOAH City, currently the managing Director of Century Properties and CEO of Revolution Precrafted.

6. Bea Rose Santiago for Public Relations, A Filipina actress who was also chosen as the 2013 Miss International. Active in a number of media both domestically and abroad.

Okay, hold on one second!

Bruce Rivera
Admitted to the bar in May 2006 [Chan-Robles], Cebu native Rivera is best known for defending, defended businesswoman and alleged pork barrel scam mastermind Janet Lim-Napoles [Inq]. With that said and as a political blogger who has been monitoring the Philippine government since 2015, I know for myself that Bruce Rivera is not the chief legal advisor of the Duterte presidential family.
For one, Atty. Salvador Panelo is still the Presidential Legal Counsel, and I have yet to learn of a single court case where Rivera represented any member of Dutertes immediate family.

Somethings off. Lets check another one.

""Chief legal advisor for the Duterte presidential family of the Philippines""


David Mezrahid
A google search using Mezrahid Princeton university does not show entries that definitively say that Noah Foundation CEO David Mezrahid indeed works for the illustrious Princeton University. Moreover, a look at the work history in his [LinkedIn] account shows that hes been based in either Western Europe and HongKong but never in the United States.

Princeton is in New Jersey, United States.


The Others
Century Propertys Robbie Antonios [Linkedin] account doesnt include anything about Noah Foundation, and I sincerely doubt that hed involve himself in the field of cryptocurrency for the simple reason that hes a lot better at doing other things.

Executive Martin Salvador, which Noah claims to have over 20 years of experience in project management, turns out to have been a K-12 teacher in the United States from 2001 to 2012[Linkedin], so where did those 20 years come from?

Meanwhile, I cannot seem to find anything about Chief director Clarke Robertson, which the site claims to be a CTO (chief technology officer) of several London-based companies.

And lastly, Miss International 2013 Bea Rose Santiago, supposedly Noahs PR head do I even have to explain this?

Smells like Fraud
So far, I have shown that Noah Coins website appears to be fraudulent. Unfortunately, it appears that some OFWs may have been defrauded as the Philippine Embassy in Tokyos warned everyone in March 2017 against both purchasing Noah Coins and engaging with Noah Foundation.

BSP has not issued authorization to The Noah Foundation and/or Noah Global Innovation Services Inc. (Noah Global) to engage in the pre-selling of Noah Coins nor recognize that Noah Coin is a national project, the embassy said.

The embassy added, Noah Global has no secondary license or authority in selling and trading of bonds, securities and similar instruments.


Moreover, the embassy said Noah cant be found in its registered address in the Net Lima building in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

According to Noahs website, however, the company is located in Unit 3106 Trade and Financial Tower at 32nd St., Bonifacio Global City, Taguig.

But it doesn't end there.
The Noah website earlier claimed that one of its sponsors is Filipino-Chinese business tycoon Lucio Tan of the LT group. However, in an official press statement issued earlier this year, the Philippine National Bank said it or any of its affiliates are not connected with the Noah Project, Noah Coins, and Noah Foundation.


According to PNB, Rest assured that PNB and the LT Group of Companies shall not hesitate to take any and all appropriate legal action to address this misrepresentation.

The page claiming sponsorship from the LT group has since been taken down, although a screenshot of the entire page can be found by clicking here, and one of Noah Coins promotional videos claiming a connection with the LT Groups Philippine Airlines still exists, as show at 13:00 of the following video:


Somethings really off here, especially since I also discovered a similarly-named cryptocurrency, the NOAHcoin. Launched in 2014, NOAHcoin is totally different from the Noah Coin discussed in this article, which has yet to be launched.

In the relatively small world of cryptocurrencies, why would someone use a name that has been used before and the name of a failed cryptocurrency at that?

Yes, all signs, so far, point to fraud.


Non-refundable? No receipts?
I tried to see how Noah Coins work by clicking on the Buy button at noahcoin.org. This led me to noahcoin.co, the Noah Coin payment portal. After registering and logging in, I clicked on Order NOAH, which is presumably that which will allow me to buy some coins.

A popup notification appeared, as shown in the screenshot below:


According to the popup, a notification was issued by the Embassy of the Philippines, as it was recently discovered that certain purchasers were carrying out excessive advertisement of NOAH COIN on their websites as agents.

This is confusing. A currencys value depends heavily on how widely it is recognized, so advertising is key to its success. Why would Noah dissuade people from talking about the currency?

I closed the popup and I was sent straight to the payment screen. From there, I saw that the lowest amount that I can buy is US$ 8333.33, with a promise that it will be worth US$ 9,333.33, presumably by the time Noah Coins are launched on 12 June 2018. There are two other options: $25,000 and $83,333.

Wow, that's a lot of money required!
Of course, its one thing to require an entry amount of over $8,333 (Php 420,000) but its another thing for people to actually give Noah that money. However, a look at Issue Invitation Code page shows that a payment is necessary for a Noah user to earn bonuses for inviting other people into the system.

Specifically, the Issue Invitation Code page states:
After we confirmed your payment, Issue Invitation Code will be available.
Adding the fact that Noah discourages excessive advertisement, what we see here is a classic sign of a multi-level marketing (pyramiding) scheme, where people are required to pay an amount upfront before they are allowed to sell products to others.

In short, the Noah Project is a pyramiding scheme that disguises itself as a remittance service, especially since it also has a rewards page that is atypical of labels in cryptocurrency portfolio management platforms.

To make matters worse, the FAQ page explicitly states that Noah DOES NOT issue receipts. Yes, Noah expects people to shell out hundreds of thousands of pesos without proof of payment. The fact that payments can only be made through bitcoins makes the transactions even more untraceable.


Heres a video recording of what I did in Noahcoin.co:


Noah stole identities?
It appears that this whole thing was started by a Japanese national.

Based on his Facebook post, Izumi Tadashi is the one who started the entire Noah thing: the foundation, the project, and the coins.

Part of the Tadashis post states:
Noah coin is doing very well and the project is progressing. I am really looking forward to the exchange in June 2018. Please wait for the official announcement from the Noah foundation about the start time of the third term presale.

Tadashi announced this on 11 December 2016. He posted this one month before Noah was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission:

Receipt Date: 06 January 2017, a month after Tadashi's post.
At this point, I have reason to believe that Tadashi is the ""power behind the throne""... but how about the others? Did the website use the identities of the six people without them knowing? Or are the six actually in on it?

On 02 July 2017, Atty. Rivera announced [FB]:

NOTE: Francis Manalo Santos has already left the group.
Rivera wasnt clear about what foundation it was. However, it appears to be a certain Noah Global Innovation Foundation or Noah Foundation Japan, judging from his post on 22 August 2017 [FB].

""Noah""
After a little more digging, I discovered that Rivera actually brought in August 2017 two Noah co-founders  Clarke Robertson and Martin Salvador  to Davao to meet Davao Mayor Inday Sara Duterte-Carpio. With Rivera, Robertson, and Salvador was Japanese National Izumi Tadashi.

L to R: Davao Mayor Inday Sara Duterte-Carpio with Noah Foundation's Clarke Robertson, Martin Salvador, and Izumi Tadashi. Sources from Davao City Hall informed me that Rivera brought these three with him.

To promote his illicit overseas business, it seems that Rivera used Duterte-Carpio without the latter being aware of it. After all, who would think that a ""foundation"" would be a money remittance service?

I sure won't.

Tadashi and the gang even appeared at the DDS Global Thanksgiving Event held in August 2017 at the Crocodile Park in Davao City, donating P1-million to the Armed Forces. Sources informed me that the event was largely sponsored by Tadashi himself.

The Check
Well, thanks! But at the cost of OFW who may lose hard-earned money to a pyramiding scheme?

Epilogue
What we have here is Noah Coins, a cryptocurrency that offers itself as a cheap way for OFWs to remit money to the Philippines but all signs point to a pyramiding scheme. It is unclear as to how many have bought Noah coins mainly because Noahs payment portal does not issue receipts, i.e. it will be difficult to prove who paid what when.

Noah Coins are issued by Izumi Tadashi brainchild Noah Foundation, with confirmed founders being Atty. Bruce Rivera, Clarke Robertson, and Martin Salvador. The Foundation also appears to be the financier behind the foreign trips of Riveras group that includes fellow bloggers MJ Quiambao Reyes and Rocky Gonzales.

Noahs administrators have a penchant for claiming association with big names in Philippine business and politics, presumably to help gain the trust of prospective clients. It has, however, been threatened with legal action after Lucio Tans PNB found out, and the Philippine Embassy in Tokyo has already advised OFWs to exercise caution in dealing with the organization.

With these, I have a few recommendations:

1. Financial literacy programs for OFWs and their dependents so they are likely to fall prey to these kinds of scams.

2. Tougher regulations for cryptocurrencies, because cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated today.

3. Tougher enforcement of laws relating to overseas remittance services, especially those that involve unstable or newly-introduced cryptocurrencies.

4. An SEC investigation with the option to pursue civil forfeiture proceedings against Noahs founders, possibly to help OFW victims, if any.

5. An NBI investigation on everyone involved with the Noah Foundation, and filing of charges if needed.

On a final note, let me state the obvious reality that OFWs are already living very challenging lives, so I hope fellow Filipinos, especially those who masquerade as OFW champions, will not do things that will make their lives even more challenging.",RJ Nieto,"December 18, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/12/ofws-beware-atty-bruce-riveras-noah.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#DengGate: Dear Mr. President, heres the memo you asked for","Dear Mr. President,


I did some arm twisting so I can be seated next to you during the bloggers Christmas Party held yesterday in Malacaang. I felt the need to do so because I wanted to be sure that you are already aware of the #DengGate scandal, where over 800,000 kids have been injected with a defective vaccine, thanks to corrupt officials in the government and a greedy pharmaceutical company.

You instructed me to write a memo about it and give it to Sec. Bong Go, so here it is. You said I don't have to sign it, but I decided to publish it on my blog too. I stand by what I write, pero salamat pa rin po sa pag-unawa.

I have spoken with dengue experts, government officials, and victims families to learn more about what happened. Adding the results of extensive research about this particular issue, heres a relatively short brief of the nightmare thats haunting almost a million children and their families today. This is by no means an exhaustive discussion of the problem. Please consult experts on the issue, experts from both sides, so that you can get a better picture of what has happened.

With that said, let's start with the basics.

How dengue basically works
Persons who get sick with the dengue virus for the first time suffer from mild dengue, which is generally not a serious disease. The problem, however, is when the same person gets sick for the second time, because its when severe dengue happens.

Severe dengue is a potentially deadly complication due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment.


Hence, a persons first dengue infection is like a warning, sort of like a free pass, a message saying, You should be very careful because itll be so much worse, if not fatally worse, the next time.

Senator Richard Gordon has warned about this in as early as December 2015 when he said Sanofi itself admitted risks, but the DoH ignored him.

Anti-Dengue Mass Vaccination Program
In early April 2016, the DoH launched a massive anti-dengue immunization program covering 1 million 4th grade students in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and NCR. The program used Sanofis newly-developed vaccine Dengvaxia which, at the time, was recommended only for individuals have had dengue before and are 9 years or older.

At the time, both Sanofi and the World Health Organization have warned against vaccinating those with no history of dengue. This warning stems from the vaccines tendency to act as the first infection, so that the first real infection (through a mosquito bite) will mimic the symptoms of a second infection.
Let me state this more clearly: If a person has never had dengue before and gets bitten by a mosquito for the first time, that person will get mild dengue. However, if that same person who has never had dengue is vaccinated with Dengvaxia AND gets bitten for the first time, he gets severe dengue right away. In short, Dengvaxia dramatically worsens dengue symptoms for those who have never had dengue before.

I feel that Sanofi was a bit sneaky with this warning because they called it a theoretical risk, as clinical trials on 2- to 14- y/o kids confirmed that Dengvaxia has the exact same effects on those aged 2 to 9. The trial, however, has very few test subjects aged 9 and up, so Sanofi cant say yet if Dengvaxia does the same to that age group. 

Sanofis material concealment, DoHs mathematical manipulation
However, instead of finding additional suitable test subjects (i.e. aged 9 and up with no dengue history), Sanofi marketed the vaccine right away. After all, Sanofis trials basically proved that Dengvaxia is not for 9 and below. If they did another trial for those 9 and above and confirmed the same adverse results, then Dengvaxia wouldve gone straight to the trash bin. That is, the $1.78 billion theyve invested in the past 20 years wouldve gone to waste.

And here comes another problem.

DoH wanted to inject 1 million kids with Dengvaxia, even if they are not sure who among them have had dengue before (seropositive) or and those who have not (seronegative).

According to WHOs April 2016 paper on Dengvaxia, the vaccine may still be used for mass immunizations if at least 70% of target population is seropositive, and thats what the DoH used to justify its vaccination program.
To do this, they cited a 2016 study, where it was found out that 90% of 1,000 randomly selected residents of Punta Princesa, Cebu City are seropositive. The DoH extrapolated Cebu City data to say that 90% of 4th graders in NCR, CALABARZON, and Central Luzon are seropositive, which would supposedly fulfill WHOs guidelines.

This is bad math, to say the least, because the test samples (from Cebu) ARE NOT representative of the target population (from Luzon). And despite this glaring flaw, Malacaan, through Spokesperson Roque and Secretary Duque, still uses this justification.

DoH endangered over 830,000 kids
DoH was actually unsure about how many and which among the 1 million kids targeted are seronegative. As I have said before, Dengvaxia worsens dengue symptoms for seronegative recipients, i.e. children who have not had dengue.

I should also note that the same WHO document advises against mass vaccinating populations where less than 50% are seropositive. The problem, however, was that DoH was in a strange rush so they did away with testing children and vaccinated them right away.

DoH Sec. Duque has confirmed that at least 830,000 kids have been vaccinated so far. The vaccine, which was for a time also available from local private vendors, was also privately administered to many Filipinos. DoH doesnt know which ones of those 830,000 kids have never had dengue before. That is, DoH doesnt know which ones require monitoring and which ones who dont.

Mr. President, this is a big mess. A big, deadly mess.

Lets take care of the 830,000 kids first
Before I discuss how the situation has gone this bad, let me first recommend a few preliminary courses of action so that we can minimize the harm caused to the 830,000 kids by this DoH debacle.

First, de-escalate through information
Simply telling people not to panic will not prevent them from panicking. Instead, you may want to ask for airtime from the major networks so you can address the entire country and explain to them whats going on and what you are doing or planning to do about it.

You can also ask DepEd to to discuss the issue during PTA meetings. You may also order social workers in affected areas to visit the homes.

Reach out to Dengvaxia victims to reassure them that the government is doing its best to address the situation. Instruct the social workers to educate the families on ways to mitigate the situation. More than lowering mortality rates, this can help calm down panicky parents who are clueless about whats going on. 

Second, create an emergency fund
Please set up an emergency fund that hospitals, whether private or public, can tap into anytime. Set it up in such a way that a hospital can withdraw from it to cover the expenses of any patient who reports a fever and fits the profile of those who were under the botched vaccination program, or shows any proof that they have been vaccinated with Dengvaxia.

This way, parents of Dengvaxia victims, who are typically not well off, will be less likely to think twice about consulting doctors, enabling the medical establishment to diagnose dengue cases early, thereby lowering mortality rates.

Third, restore trust in the public health system
Please suspend or terminate all officials who have a lot to do with this mess. This way, we can help quell the publics doubts on the integrity and general reliability of the public healthcare system.

Now, lets ask: How did it come this far?

First, FDA changed rules in 2013 to favor Sanofi
One major main point of contention in this vaccine scandal is the uncertainty of Dengvaxias effects on seronegative recipients (never had dengue) aged 9 and up. An issue where the WHO said it is critical to evaluate as soon as possible whether there is any risk to this population.

Phase IV drug trials could have addressed this issue. In Phase IV drug trials, a new drug is sold publicly to 3,000 people per year for three years as doctors closely monitor recipients for adverse effects.

That is exactly what Malaysia demanded in April this year before it clears Dengvaxia there, and that is exactly what the Philippine failed to do in as far as Dengvaxia.
In 2013, then FDA chief Kenneth Hartigan-Go made Phase IV trials optional when he said manufacturers, by themselves, can decide whether to do Phase IV trials or not. Thus, Sanofi was able to market Dengvaxia right after their Phase III trials ended.

I have reason to believe that Hartigan-Go did this to benefit Sanofi. Before joining government, Hartigan-Go was an Executive Director of Zuellig Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Zuellig Pharma, Sanofis official local distributors. After leaving government in June 2016, Hartigan-Go headed AIMs Zuellig School.


He is Zuellig through-and-through. Suffice it to say, the Philippines de facto Phase IV Dengvaxia trial was done on 830,000 innocent children. Hartigan-Go, regardless of intent, indeed used 830,000 Filipino kids as laboratory rats.

Second, corruption in procurement
The Aquino Government has been in talks with Sanofi in as early as 2014, when PNoy met Sanofi during the Beijing APEC summit. In May 2015, DOH Sec. Garin clandestinely met Sanofi in France and taught the French executives how to entice our Congress to purchase Dengvaxia. Lastly, in early December 2015, Pnoy, Garin, and other cabinet members met with Sanofi on the days surrounding the Paris Accord meetings.

Less than a month after the Paris meetings and before 2015 ended, DBM has already released a SARO for P3.5 billion, sourced from the Office of the Presidents Miscellaneous Personnel Benefits Fund and transferred to the Philippine Childrens Medical Center. That is, despite the DAP ruling issued earlier in February 2015, the Aquino Government used a DAP-like mechanism just 10 months later.

PCMC received P3 billion from these funds and used it to buy Dengvaxia. This amount raises suspicion because Sanofi declared only EUR 20 million (P1 billion) in Dengvaxia sales for Q1 2016.

Where did the other P2 billion pesos go?

What made this whole thing even more irregular is that all these procurement steps were taken before Dengvaxia was discussed by the Formulary Executive Council. All drugs require FEC approval before the government can procure them, and the Aquino Government procured Dengvaxia without one, as the FEC approval (exemption) was issued after the fact.

Third, coverup within DOH
Evidence suggests that DoH rank and file may be trying to cover up the Dengvaxia mess.

I stumbled upon the case of a 12-year-old child in Capas, Tarlac, who contracted severe dengue just three months after receiving the third and final dose of Dengvaxia. She was among the 500,000 fourth graders who actually received the vaccine during launch.

I spoke to the mother over the phone and she told me that she did not sign any consent form, that she found out about her daughters vaccination only after the fact.

The childs family is very poor. The mother even had to borrow money just to get the child admitted to a hospital in Tarlac City. She was openly soliciting for financial through social media and I told her that I will visit her the next day to speak to her, to hand her a few thousand pesos from my own pocket, and to ask her to ask her to fill out several forms so I can help her get more substantial financial help from charitable GOCCs and public officials.

Upon arriving at the hospital, however, I discovered that DOH-Tarlac has whisked her away to Pampanga two hours prior. I wouldve given DOH the benefit of the doubt, if not for the fact that the hospital staff told me that DOH paid for her outstanding balance. The hospital is privately-owned the child has been in ICU for a couple of days or so. I doubt that DOH has discretionary funds that it can use to bail out patients just like that.

I smell a cover up. If the DOH bailed out that 12-year-old, then why didnt it bail out the 12-year-olds neighbors, who were also stricken with dengue and admitted in the same hospital?

With that said, I have serious doubts about the accuracy of reports that Secretary Duque has been receiving.

Fourth, a massive coverup upstairs
The issue could have been addressed sooner and more thoroughly if it werent for some government officials apparently trying to cover up the mess. Prior to Sanofis November admission that Dengvaxia is bad for those who have never had dengue, the House of Representatives has actually attempted to investigate the issue in as early as October 2016.

However, according to some of the resource persons invited in the first hearing, several congressmen, including then party-list Representative Harry Roque, attempted to prevent anti-Dengvaxia resource persons to testify.

On the first day, Roque told Philhealth director Dr. Tony Leachon, a resource person, that the latter cannot be allowed to testify because of the lack of approval from the Philippine College of Physicians, of which Leachon was president. This defies logic because Leachon is an expert on the issue with or without PCP approval.

According to Leachon, Roque and the other congressmen stayed mum as former Health Sec. Janette Garin, who was just an audience member during the hearing, kept on standing up and intimidating the witness. Leachon said Garin went hysterical so the presiding officer was forced to adjourn the first hearing only an hour after it started, no complaints or admonitions against Garin came from Roque.

A few hours prior to the second hearing, Roque approached Leachon and asked him to state his credentials as Roque had it videotaped. When the hearing started, Roque played a spliced version of the footage and made it appear that Leachon, a very accomplished physician, was overconfident. That is, Roque character-assassinated Leachon even before Leachon was able to speak in front of the committee.

Please call Dr. Tony Leachon to confirm these allegations.

I would not have made a big deal out of this if not for the fact that Roque actively defended Sanofi when the Dengue Vaccine Scandal erupted a couple of weeks ago. As a presidential spokesperson, he should have exercised restraint and put into mind that he speaks on the presidents behalf. Surely, the president that I supported from Day One would have better things to say than Dont panic.

Its also weird that Secretary Duque flip-flopped on his pronouncements and I suspect Roque has a hand in it.

About a week ago, Duque said Aquino should attend the Senate probe on Dengvaxia. Recently, however, Duque seems to have forgotten about Aquinos liability as he focused solely on Sanofi in his announcements, in line with the Liberal Partys general PR storyline.

My sources said Roque pressured Duque in the same way Roque pressured then Health Sec. Paulyn Ubial during her confirmation hearings. Roque was instrumental in blocking Ubials confirmation, mainly because of Ubials opposition to the defective Dengvaxia vaccine. Duque, Ubials replacement, is also up for confirmation, so my sources said Roque told Duque that the latter will suffer the same fate if the latter doesnt co-operate.

I have reason to believe that the Office of the President has two primary sources for this Dengvaxia mess: Health Secretary Duque, who is under intense pressure to get confirmed; and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who still wields influence in the Lower House and who has historically antagonized those who oppose Dengvaxia.

Mr. President, you said before that you will axe anyone in your cabinet who demonstrates even a whiff of corruption.

Mr. President, behold Harry Roque. He may not be addicted to money, but he's addicted to power.

And I believe that that kind of addiction, Mr. President, is a problem worse than drugs.",RJ Nieto,"December 13, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/12/denggate-dear-mr-president-memo-bong-go-dengvaxia.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake

December 7, 2017

Secretary Francisco Duque
Department of Health
Manila, Metro Manila

Sir;

I am one of the parents whose children received the dengvaxia vaccine. I am saddened with the news on the side effects of the vaccine. I now fear for the life and well being of my son.

As a single parent with no stable income, I have no capacity to send my children to a private school and public school is the only option. More so, I cannot afford for any hospitalization. I am in such a hand-to-mouth existence that I wasnt able to even pay/update my Philhealth contributions. So when the government DOH thru DepEd launched a program of vaccines for dengue, I was happy because I believed that my children can now be safe from dengue, safe from any eventual hospitalization due to the dengue virus (sickness). 

I fully trusted the government, that the DOH and all the people in charge of this program have sound judgment and are 100% sure that the vaccine is 100% safe, not harmful and only useful to the Filipino citizens especially to children. 

I cannot believe until now that our government can use our children to become guinea pigs. Until this very hour I cannot contain my fear for the life of my child. 

On Nov. 14, 2017 my son K**** A**** had fever accompanied with terrible headache, diarrhea and vomiting. I only self medicate since I dont have money to bring him to the doctor. On the 3rd day he no longer have fever and the diarrhea has stopped so on the fourth day I already sent him to school. 

But on the following week thats November 22,2017 he again had fever. He doesnt want to move because he had a terrible headache, muscle and joint pains, pain in his nape and in his eyeballs. He also have diarrhea and vomit everytime he eats or drink. Again I only self medicate because of financial constraint. I only give him biogesic, papaya sap and oresol. 

On November 25, 2017. he had convulsions and he was already dehydrated. I gave dolan suppository and gave him pocari sweats and buko juice. Thats when I was able to borrow money and finally bring him to a doctor for consultation and did laboratory tests. 

The result shows that his platelet is already high but he already has infections in his urine and and his white blood count is also high. He was given co-amoxiclav. 

The following day, his fever already subside. And because I have no money I wasnt able to bring him to the hospital but all the symptoms of dengue manifested in him. 

It's been four days since I heard the news about the vaccine and its dangers and I couldnt sleep until now, thinking how dangerous the situation my son faces. And I cannot forgive myself if something bad happens to him. I already have this trauma. And I wanted to know and have him checked through blood test if indeed he just had dengue so I can monitor my child closely. I cannot have peace of mind until the test is done but I cannot afford it on my own.

I have watched Sec Harry Roque's press conference with Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy on Dengvaxia and I am so frustrated, disappointed and I felt betrayed. I cannot believe how the government downplayed the dengue issue. 

I cannot believe how Sec. Roque, being the mouthpiece of the president, could make pronouncements that are not factual. His ignorance to the subject ( dengue sickness) is not an excuse for him to make statements that is contrary to the real effect or real condition having a severe dengue. He should not let the public go blind on a real condition with a severe dengue. 
On the contrary, he should have at least educated the people especially the parents of recipients of that vaccine so we could assist our children carefully. I have followed posts on FB pages of several doctors for a week now and I learned a lot from them. Their posts are very informative and they explained it in laymans terms, so that any parent could easily understand how the dengue works in the body, how it could affect the other vital organs and how it can endanger the patient. 

Doctors like Dr Richard Mata, Dr Willie Ong and others.

I am disappointed at how the government downplayed the issue. the harm, the danger the physical and emotional issues we parents are battling now. 

I have come to ask myself: where can we go and ask help? Who would help us if the government is very reluctant. How can we seek justice? 

Then it came to my mind: where else would we asked help but to the very agency who caused danger to our children? It is this agency's negligence that the lives our children is now at risk, their safety uncertain.

Therefore I now ask the DoH thru you Sir to please help us in every way. This is the least that this government/Dept (DOH) can do for us. I for myself am asking for blood test for my child so I may know if he just got infected with dengue or not. And I need a written assurance from DOH that the it will shoulder all medical , laboratory fees , hospital bills from the onset of fevermeaning from monitoring to actual confinement to all/any hospital may it be public or private whichever is nearer when time/need arises. 

Please stop asking us to go to public hospitals if it is too far from our residence because some of us if not most dont even have money for transportation. And we have to really consider the distance as it could affect a lot to the well being of the patient and to the guardian as well. 

I am also awaiting some measures from the government such as maybe giving insect repellents to the 10% of the recipients in which the DOH spokesperson claimed who has not infected with dengue prior to immunizations. Or maybe the government will again conduct the brgy smoke something to eradicate mosquitoes. Or anything that could help these 10% free from dengue . I am sure this measures is not as expensive as the cost of the vaccines itself.

I also understand that this problem is not caused by the present administration but still it is the government who made it happened or bring this great danger to the lives of the children. So please let us for now just simply think And consider the welfare, the lives of the recipients.

Although in my innermost self I wanted all the people behind it, Aquino, Garin and the rest to be jailed but what truly matters now is the life of my son. And the assistance I am now seeking. 

I am hoping that you, your office the DOH will hear my plea and act on my request at the soonest possible time.

Thank you so much.

#DengGate: Botched Tarlac Dengvaxia case hints DoH-led coverup,"The Dengvaxia article that may finally pave the way for  my ""liquidation"". The Dengvaxia article that may finally pave the way for  my ""liquidation"". Here's one from a blogger who can't be bought.



The #DengGate controversy centers on the Aquino Governments botched anti-dengue mass vaccination program using global pharmaceutical giant Sanofis anti-dengue experimental vaccine Dengvaxia. With P3.5 billion ($76 million) in illegally channeled public funds, the Philippines bought around 1,000,000 three-dose sets for use in a pilot batch of 1 million 9- to 10-year-old 4th Grade children in Central Luzon, CALABARZON, and the National Capital Region.

Under the hastily launched program, over 500,000 of these children received their first dose the 2nd quarter of 2016. The government has so far injected over 700,000 children with the drug until it halted the program right after Sanofi admitted just days ago that the drug worsens dengue symptoms if administered to individuals who have never had dengue.

In an apparent attempt to quell fears, Malacaang spokesperson Harry Roque said there is no reason to panic, arguing that there will be nine out of ten who will be protected from severe dengue. Another senior palace official, Health Secretary Francisco Duque, said the first Dengvaxia dose provides a 30-month protection from the disease.

Roques Nine out of ten
Assuming the unlikely event that Roques nine out of ten statistic has factual basis, asking the public not to panic solely on the basis that 90% of the vaccine recipients are protected directly negates Roques supposed reputation as a human rights lawyer.

Does the protecting 90% justify endangering the remaining 10%? The government inoculated over 700,000 individuals, so the fact that Sanofi and the government endangered over 70,000 is no reason to panic? Besides, how sure is Roque that 90% have had dengue before, which is a requirement for the vaccine to work as designed?


Where is the study? When was it published? Where was it published? Or did the government just made that number up to justify the botched mass vaccination program?

To add further insult to injury, Roque, aside from being the presidential spokesman, is also the Presidential Adviser on Human Rights.

Duques 30-month protection
Whats more disturbing, however, is the Department of Healths claim that Dengvaxia provides a 30-month protection before the risk of contracting severe dengue kicks in.

Referring to those who received Dengvaxia but have never had the virus in the past, Duque said in Filipino, Even if they received their first dose, they shouldnt panic because the first dose of the vaccine gives protection for 30 months.
Under Duques 30-month protection theory, all of the recipients under the assailed vaccination program must still be alive by today, because the program was launched only 20 months ago.

Civil society group Volunteers against Crime and Corruption (VACC) claims that at least three kids have died after receiving Dengvaxia as manufacturer Sanofi maintains that there have been no deaths due to the vaccine.

30-month protection a myth?
In as early as programs second week, however, a male recipient was pronounced dead on arrival at the Bataan General Hospital after suffering from cardiac arrest.

Just two weeks after the death, authorities exculpated Dengvaxia by pinning the blame on congenital heart disease. Then-Health Secretary Janette Garin, who was the vaccines main government proponent and who headed its regulatory approval, ascertained the cause of death in no more than 14 days.


Authorities said the child died due to cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema and other underlying causes such as congenital heart disease, gastroenteritis, with moderate dehydration.

Now, Dengue can trigger cardiac arrest [Vancini-Campanharo 2016]. Its is linked to pulmonary edema [Lee 2012]. It also has symptoms similar to gastroenteritis [Varatharaj 2010], and it also causes dehydration [US CDC].

Is former Health Sec. Garin absolutely certain that its not dengue, or was she, along with the rest of her department, merely trying to cover up the mess?

I have reason to believe that it is so, as Garin has an extensive history of ignoring multiple World Health Organization warnings against Dengvaxia, warnings that were issue way before, right before, and immediately after the launch of her catastrophic mass immunization program.

DoH Sec. Duque versus Reality
If Garin indeed attempted a coverup, does it also mean that Health Sec. Duques 30-month protection theory is just a figment of his imagination?

Just hours ago, News5 reported that 10-year-old Bataan 4th grader Christine Mae de Guzman, one of the vaccines first recipients, died from severe dengue before receiving her second dose of Dengvaxia scheduled October this year. Christine had no prior history of the disease: this was her first dengue infection.

Duques 30-month protection theory would have meant that Christine would still be alive by now.

But according to the death certificate, Christine died from severe dengue.


What happened to this Christine seems to confirm the untested risk with Dengvaxia that Sanofi itself cited in a 17 March 2016 document of the World Health Organization. Sanofi said that for those who have never had dengue:
The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary infection (which is typically more severe)
Was Duque referring to some parallel universe that the rest of the planet has yet to discover? If so, then let us hope that we can refund the P3.5 billion we paid Sanofi so we can ship the 700,000 kids to the Bermuda Triangle and hope against all hopes that they will somehow end up there.

But then, I am very big believer of Hanlons razor, or the saying, Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

So, should we attribute the 30-month protection theory to malice, or is it merely a product of stupidity?

Please, not another Christine!
Yesterday, I interviewed Lejani Pangalangan, a Tarlac mother who claimed that her daughter, Aimy Junnel Tamayo, contracted dengue.

Aimy never had dengue prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. She received all three doses under the same mass immunization program where the late Christine got hers. Aimys last Dengvaxia shot was in August 2017, and the mother claims Aimy contracted dengue three months later on 28 November 2017.


After the phone interview last night, the mother and I agreed to meet this afternoon. I told her that I will visit them in Tarlac so I can interview them personally. The mother was even glad that Ill come to visit because I promised to help them with the bills after she told me that she even had to borrow money so she could bring Aimy to the hospital.

The mother also said in the interview that the child was vaccinated without parental consent, although she doesnt blame Aimys teachers for it because she believes that the teachers acted only upon orders from the Department of Health.

I wrote a ThinkingPinoy article about that phone interview and it was published last night at 12:12 AM. The article quickly went viral and it has garnered over 16,000 shares as of this articles writing.


A few hours later at 7:12 AM, the mother Lejani tried to call me but the signal on my phone was poor. I have a morning radio program, Karambola sa DWIZ, so I was inside a building at time, preparing for the show. I texted Lejani, asking why she tried to call.

Lejani replied in Filipino, I just want to correct something I said. I think I was mistaken when I said there was no parental consent. I signed a waiver before the first dose. The teacher found a copy.

That was odd. Leijani said she discovered about the immunization only after Aimys younger sister complained about why she wasnt given Denvaxia too. If Leijani indeed signed a consent form, how would she totally forget about it?


JUST A FEW HOURS LATER AND SHES BACKTRACKING ALREADY!?

I smelled fear
I felt that Leijani was lying about the consent form, but I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Despite my reservations, I immediately updated the article to reflect this development and I informed her about it about it right away.

A few minutes later, Lejani texted, Please, sir, I do not want to ruin their reputation! Please delete the article if you dont mind! They love my daughter a lot!

I replied, Yup. Theyre safe. Ill protect them.

Should there be problems, I was intent on defending Aimys teachers, even if it has to be in front of Education Secretary Leonor Briones: I wouldve done so even if no one asked for it.

I have interviewed Sec. Briones just two weeks ago, I have her contact details, and I believe that she is a very fair and just human being who responds well to reason. Teachers are already overworked and underpaid. While they are expected to follow all the rules by the book,

I am a firm believer that they deserve to be shown more compassion than most people.
Despite the assurance, the mother repeatedly insisted that I take down the article, but it takes more than a couple of text messages for me to do that. Leijani sent one text after another, with each subsequent message sounding more and more panicky.

Unfortunately, my radio show starts at 8 AM so I couldnt read or respond to her messages during that time, so I texted, Ill speak to you later po, Im on air right now.


(The Filipino word Po is a form that indicates respect or politeness.)

After the radio show ended, I immediately and repeatedly tried to call her after the radio show but her phone cannot be reached. I started to worry, as there are wide range of things that could have gone wrong with the child. Leijani told me the night before Aimys platelet count was low at 38 and may still be falling.

From my best recollection, I think I managed to call her at around 11:30 AM as I was on the way to Tarlac, I confirmed with her that we will meet between 2 and 3 PM as previously agreed upon.

I texted her again at 12:50 PM, asking her if she was alright.

She replied at 1:53 PM with, I hope you can delete the article.


Shocked in Tarlac
I arrived at the hospital at exactly 2:19 PM, in line with our agreement.

Right before I entered the lobby, a hospital staffer recognized me and asked for a photo. The hospital staffer said he is one of my social media followers so he was already aware of what Leijani and I agreed upon. He told me that Aimy and Leijani have already been transferred to another hospital.

I was shocked. I told him I needed more details, so he introduced me to another hospital staffer who witnessed the hospital discharge. Note that I will never reveal their identity, for their own protection.

The second staffer told me the following that doctors from the Department of Health  Tarlac arrived at hospital around 9:00 AM. The doctors spoke to Leijani over breakfast at the hospital cafeteria.

He said the doctors paid for all the expenses Leijani has so far incurred and told the hospital that they will facilitate the patients discharge for transfer to Jose B. Lingad Hospital in the neighboring province of San Fernando, Pampanga.

Do provincial DoH offices have discretionary funds that can be used to bail out patients from private hospitals?

If so, why just Aimy? Some of Aimys neighbors also got struck with dengue and are in the same hospital, so why did DoH Tarlac take Amy and no one else?

Dr. Santos takes no one else
The hospital staffers said all the hospital employees who witnessed the scene were all surprised.

Concerned about mother and child, a hospital employee even asked Leijani if she will have a place to stay in Pampanga. According to the staffer, one of the DoH doctors said theyll give Leijani a room.

One of the staffers told me that it was highly irregular and perplexing.

He said theres a dengue epidemic in Leijanis village and some of the other dengue victims are admitted in the same hospital. He wondered why DoH-Tarlac took Leijani and Aimy and left everyone else behind.

He said they left at 12 noon in a vehicle with DoH-JBL decals (branding).

One of them told me in Filipino, You know, one of their teachers also contracted dengue. Her platelet count is less than 10 so shes on the 5th floor. Would you like me to bring you to her?

I respectfully declined the offer on humanitarian grounds. The teachers platelet count is low so I do not want to subject her to further stress anymore. For all I know, she might start hemorrhaging just by trying to talk.

Asked for the names of the DoH doctors, the staffers said they cant recall the exact names anymore, but one of them said one of the doctors had a surname of Santos.

Shocked, confused, and slightly scared
Something felt really off so I decided that its better if I do not stay in that place for too long. If theres a massive coverup going on, then its not improbable that somebody within the hospital premises may be looking for me

I thanked the hospital staffers, quickly exited the building, did a quick 5-minute Facebook live session as proof that I really went there, then immediately left Tarlac.

Tarlac, after all, is the home of former President Benigno Aquino, one of the masterminds of the Dengvaxia Scandal.

I tried to call Leijani again as soon as we got onto the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, but no one was answering. For some really weird reason, Leijani, the Dengvaxia victims mother, doesnt want to talk to me anymore.

I immediately called my friend Sass Rogando Sasot at around 3:35 PM and I told her about what happened. She asked for Leijanis number and she said shell call Leijani herself.

The rest of the this section is based on how Sass recounted the events to me.

Sass dialed Leijanis number but it was busy.

She dialed it again and it rang. Leijani picked it up.

Sass asked Leijani, I want to donate, where I can I send my donation?

Leijani and her friends were trying to solicit financial help for Amy online since last night. Thus, Leijani shouldnt be surprised if she gets calls from total strangers, in the same way that she wasnt surprised when I called her last night.

Leijani said, You can deposit it to a bank account.

Sass asked, Where are you right now?

In Pampanga, Leijani replied.

Sass asked, How did you get there?

Sass heard somebody talk to Leijani and just moments later, Leijani hung up.

Available data suggests that DoH Tarlac took just Leijani and her daughter Aimy. They left Tarlac for Pampanga at 12 noon and the call took place at around 3:35 PM so Leijanis relatives, if any, are unlikely to be there that fast.

A ""new"" Leijani resurfaces
Who was coaching Leijani, a Health Department employee?

Leijani suddenly came back to life when she texted me again at 7:33 PM and apologized for not informing me about their transfer. She said she was already groggy out of hunger and exhaustion. She said somebody told her about the Facebook live session I did in the hospital in Tarlac.

She admitted that DoH Tarlac offered help and she accepted and that there was no money involved. She said she wasnt silenced in exchange for money, and all that she wants is a quiet life and whats best for her daughter.

The whole nine yards.

I cant take her word for it anymore because I have reason to believe that her texts were sent under duress. No, shes in probably in no physical danger, but as a mother, I think she feels the necessity to comply with whoever is necessary, for the sake of her daughter.

#DengGate has been raging for almost a week now, but we have yet to hear from a President whos typically vocal even about the littlest of issues.

If Duterte knew about #DengGate, would he be in Greenbelt yesterday to shop as the parents of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos lose sleep over the Dengvaxia scandal? Thats not Duterte, so somebody may be keeping the issue away from his eyes and his daily briefings.

I think theres a coverup going on, from a little bit below the top all the way to a little bit above the bottom. After all, many of them may be complicit to this whole mess, and many of those heads will roll if somebody opens the can of worms.

Remember DoH Tarlac.

The relative silence of government authorities, the mismatching official statements, the disappointingly scant media coverage of what would otherwise be a major national issue all of these point to a concerted effort to play down #DengGate.

All these, in my opinion, point to a massive coverup.

And who are the suspects?

#DengGate: Kid in ICU for dengue only 3 months after 3rd dose -- Tarlac Mom,"Health Secretary Francisco Duque earlier said Dengvaxia provides a 30-month protective period before risk of severe dengue for recipients with no prior history of dengue kicks in. However, an interview with a mother from Tarlac suggests that such a ""protective period"" may not be entirely true.

(Featured Image: A photo of the said 12-year-old child while in a hospital ICU inlaid with a photo of a vial of the Dengvaxia)

Update: 04 Dec 2017, 730 AM: MS. Pangalangan said she just remembered that she was actually asked by the school to sign a consent form, although she maintains that nobody explained to her Dengxaxia's limitations and potential side effects.



Yesterday, Facebook user Von Dy posted two photos of a young girl in what appears to be a hospitals Intensive Care Unit, and part of the accompanying caption reads:
""Kami po ay humihingi ng tulong sa kaso ni Aimy Junnel Tamayo, 12 yrs old at nag-aaral sa San Francisco Elementary School, San Francisco, Tarlac. Siya po ay may dengue case mula po noong Disyembre 2, 2017 (Sabado) at ngayon po ay naka admit sa Jecson Hospital Tarlac, Tarlac City. Si Aimy po ay isa nabigyan ng dengue vaccine (3 shots). Ngayon po ay nasa ICU sya at patuloy ang pag monitor sa kanya.""
[TRANSLATION: We are pleading for help for Aimy Junnel Tamayo, 12 years old and studying at San Francisco Elementary School in San Francisco, Tarlac. She contracted dengue since 02 December 2017 (Saturday) at is currently admitted at Jecson Hospital in Tarlac City. Aimy is one of the recipients of the dengue vaccine (3 shots). She currently in the Intensive Care Unite and shes being continuously monitored.]
I am generally doubtful of claims made by random people on Facebook, so I called one of the phone numbers listed in that post, and I got to speak with a certain Lejani Pangalangan, who claims to be Tamayos mother.

Pangalangan said the doctor fears her child may be suffering from dengue, just three months after receiving her third shot of Dengvaxia in August 2017.
[NOTE: Ms. Pangalangan allowed me to verify Tamayo's hospital admission. I searched for a publicly listed contact number for Jecsons Medical Center and dialed it. The hospital answered and they confirmed it.]

November 28th Fever
Pangalangan said the child started to become feverish on November 28th but she was still able to attend a school competition the 29th, although she has already become weak and frail by then.

After the family got home, Aimys cousin told Pangalangan that dengue is detectable only after three days, so she brought her daughter to the hospital on December 2nd to get her blood tested.
She said, Mababa na po yung platelet. Sabi ng doktor, ipa-admit na kasi nakaka-alarma dun sa barangay niyo ay marami nang na-dengue [Her platelet count was already low. The doctor said she should be admitted to the hospital because of the high prevalence of dengue in her barangay].

Pangalangan said Aimys platelet count is falling. It was 61 two days ago, 38 today, and the results of the latest test are still pending.

She said, Doon sa lugar namin, kung hindi po ako nagkakamali, 30 na po yung na-dengue. Then, dalawang estudyante po na kaklase po niya ngayon ay nilalagnat, so naalarma po sila (mga guro) [If Im not mistaken, there have been 30 dengue cases in my village and two and her classmates currently have fever, so the teachers are alarmed at the situation].

Theres a dengue outbreak in their village right now.

Date of Vaccinations
Pangalangan said her daughter received 3 shots of the dengue vaccine as part of the mass immunization program of Department of Health, and that her daughter has no history of contracting the dengue virus.

Aked if her daughter received Dengvaxia, she said, Grade 6 po siya ngayon. Na-inject po siya ng ganon noong Grade 4 siya two years ago [Shes in 6th grade right now. She got her first injection when she was in 4th Grade two years ago].

The said program was launched in early 2016, which is only about a year and a half ago.
Asked on the specific date of Aimys first dose, she said Aimys teacher texted her the specific dates of vaccination. After checking her inbox, she said Aimy received shots on 30 March 2016, 13 October 2016, and 14 August 2017.

Pangalangan noted that in reality, the first dengue vaccine shot may have been administered a few days later: on April 4th, 5th, or 6th.

Aimy was injected with Dengvaxia, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofis newly-launched anti-dengue vaccine.

No Consent, No Waiver, No Explanations
She said she wasnt notified about the vaccination program. She said she wasnt made to sign anything, and nothing was explained to her by any school official.

Actually po, noong sinasaksakan sila, hindi po namin alam (We actually didnt know they got vaccinated until they did), Pangalangan said.

Pangalangan added, Nagulat na lang po ako noong umuwi po iyong isang anak ko, sabi niya, Ma, si Ate, nagpa-inject pero kami, hindi. (I was shocked when one of my kids came home and said, Mom, my elder sister was vaccinated but we werent).

Pangalangan asked her younger child what was injected, and the child said it was an anti-dengue vaccine.
Natuwa pa po ako, anti-dengue pala, e di maganda siya Sino ba naman po ang hindi matutuwa e anti-dengue po pala? (I was actually pleasantly surprised because it was anti-dengue, so its good for her Who wouldnt be glad that she got anti-dengue vaccine?), Pangalangan said.

She had no idea how the vaccine works because nothing was explained to her. That is, until her elder daughter Aimy was hospitalized a few days ago.

No preliminary screening
Dengvaxia is effective on recipients who have had dengue. However, if injected on persons with no prior history of dengue, the vaccine may worsen the disease at the first natural infection, i.e. through a mosquito bite. Thus, preliminary testing for presence of dengue antibodies in a prospective recipient is key, as doing so would determine if Dengvaxia would be appropriate to administer.

Aimy was never tested prior to the first Dengvaxia dose. Moreover, Pangalangan said there was no preliminary screening done to Aimy or any of her classmates.


She said all of Aimys 4th grade batchmates were vaccinated.


Hindi ko naman po sinisisi ang mga teacher kasi iniisip nila kapakanan ng bata unang-una po, utos ng DoH (I dont blame the teachers because they only want whats best for the kids in the first place, it was an order from the Deparment of Health), Pangalangan added.

Important Note
With Ms. Pangalangan's permission, I published a recording of our entire phone call below:



This entire article was largely based on the initial Facebook post and this phone call interview. Hence, I still need to visit the facility myself to more thoroughly verify the situation.

"#DengGate: Aquinos Garin ignores WHO warnings, risks 700k Filipino kids lives","Here's the story of how Aquino-era Health Secretary Janette Garin chronically ignored expert opinion and launched what possibly is the biggest Public Health scandal in the country to date.


On 04 April 2016, the then-President Benigno Noynoy Aquino and Department of Health secretary Janette Garin launched the National Immunization Program to provide free dengue vaccine to indigent public school students in three regions in the country with the highest dengue incidence: NCR, Central Luzon, and CALABARZON [RTVM].

Over 700,000 4th graders have received Dengvaxia so far.

The dengue vaccine used for this program is Sanofis Dengvaxia and the health department planned to vaccinate 1 million 4th graders [WHO].

According to a [Sanofi] press release dated on the same day:
The vaccines anticipated impact on dengue burden is expected to stem from its documented ability to prevent 8 out of 10 dengue hospitalizations and up to 93% of severe dengue that includes hemorrhagic dengue fever that can be fatal in vaccinated study participants 9 years and older.
Sanofi and the Aquino Government didnt tell us the entire story because long-standing fears on product safety were finally confirmed recently when Sanofi, in a 29 November 2017 press release, admitted that Dengvaxia increases the risk for severe dengue on 4th graders with no prior history of the disease [Sanofi].

That is, persons who have never had dengue before and were inoculated with Dengvaxia, if infected with the dengue virus, will suffer from the disease as if it was their second dengue infection.


How Dengue works 
Heres a simple explanation of how Dengue Fever works [Matheus 2005]:
A healthy individual gets infected with dengue. He suffers from dengue fever and somehow recovers from it. However, if he gets infected again, the secondary dengue fever will be worse than the first. Suffice it to say, secondary dengue has higher mortality rates than primary dengue.
There are basically two kinds of dengue fever: regular and severe. As the name suggests, severe dengue fever has higher mortality rates than regular dengue fever.
A person infected for the first time usually suffers from regular dengue fever. If that person survives the first infection, then he must do everything he can to avoid getting infected again, as that would result into severe dengue, which is much more likely to kill him.

Here's a World Health Organization graphic that describes the difference between ""regular"" dengue (left) and severe dengue (right):

Some severe dengue cases result in organ damage (heart, etc).
Now, what did Dengvaxia do to the 4th graders who have no history of dengue?
Suppose we have a 4th grader who has never been infected with dengue receives Dengvaxia. If that child gets infected with dengue for the first time, that child will suffer from severe dengue instead of just regular dengue. 
In short, the child would have been better left without the vaccine, as Dengvaxia increases the dengue mortality rates for recipients who have never been infected with dengue.

Simply put, Dengvaxia is poison for those who have never had dengue but Aquino and Garin wanted it anyway.


How did this happen?

Concealing Critical Information
The DoH and Sanofi were not totally honest.

First, the vaccine is a lot less effective to those who have never had dengue.

If you have had dengue, the vaccine's efficacy is 81 per cent. However, if you have not been infected with dengue before, this figure is only 38 per cent [ST].

The vaccines effectiveness against those who have previously been infected with dengue is undeniable. However, the vaccine is a lot less effective if the recipient is seronegative for dengue, i.e. the recipient has no traces of dengue virus in his or her bloodstream.

Of course, we can argue that having a vaccine that works only 4 out of 10 attempts is better than having no vaccine at all. And this leads us to the second point, which is

Second and more importantly, health experts have been warning the entire time that Dengvaxia may have considerable adverse effects on seronegative recipients.

Senator Richard Gordon, after consulting health experts, has already warned against Dengvaxia in as early as 2015. In a December 2015 press release, he said: 
We talked to several health experts and they told us that they had already warned government long before about the possible adverse effect of the new drug on individuals with no prior history of dengue [Senate]. 
Gordons warnings were bolstered by no less than the March 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report just a few months later and just days before Aquino and Garin launched the Mass Vaccination Program. 

Ironically, this report appears to have been used as the basis of the Mass Vaccination Program.

WHO already said over and over that the vaccine may do more harm than good to recipients who have never had dengue prior to inoculation (seronegative) and WHO said it multiple times BEFORE Garins DoH launched the mass immunization program.

My gahd, I heyt drahgs!


Issuance of WHO Guidelines
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dengvaxia on 23 December 2015 but it was put on hold five days later pending the release of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [GMA].

Despite the lack of WHO guidelines, Garin vouched for Dengvaxia just days after the DFA announcement, in an interview with Karen Davila [YT] in 03 January 2016.

At the 1:45 mark, Davila asked:
Who is the perfect candidate to receive the dengue vaccine? . . . I've never had dengue. Ako ba, should I be vaccinated anytime?
Garin replied:
Yes. It's recommended for those nine to 45 years old, Garin said.
Oh crap! From where does Garin derive her blind faith on Sanofi and Dengvaxia?!

The Aquino government seems to have changed its mind when the Philippines hosted Dengvaxias global launch on 11 February 2016 [CNN], or over a month before WHOs 17 March 2016 publication of its background paper Dengue Vaccines on [WHO].

The Aquino Administration bought P3.5 billion worth of Dengvaxia in March 2016. Note that all contracts worth in excess of P50 million require the signature of the President.


To give Garin the benefit of the doubt, I presume that Garin used the 17 March 2016 WHO guidelines [WHO] to justify the April 04 launch of the mass vaccination program, as they are the only guidelines available at the time.

The problem: that same WHO document contains so many red flags that Garin willfully ignored.

Let me list these red flags down one by one.

Red Flag 1: Warning to Travelers
Page 5 of the WHO guidelines states, in travelers unlikely to have already had dengue, vaccination may be substantially less beneficial (and there is a theoretical risk that it may be harmful).

The WHO document advises AGAINST vaccination of travelers who have never had dengue because it may be harmful. Yes, WHO admits that Dengvaxia may be harmful to those who have never been infected with dengue. 

Red Flag 2: Vaccination can do harm
Page 6 of the WHO guidelines states, Current data suggest substantially lower benefit of vaccination in seronegative individuals 9-45 years of age. There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination could do harm in this population.

WHO says Dengvaxia is a lot less effective to those whove never had dengue, and that it may even be harmful to them.

Red Flag 3: Lack of Contraindications
Page 12 says that according to Dengvaxias packaging, the drug should NOT be administered to those with severe allergic reactions, those with immune deficiencies such as HIV or AIDS, and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

So why was there no contraindication against those whove never had dengue?

Red Flag 4: Insufficient number of trial samples
Page 19 states, The number of severe or hospitalized episodes was too small to undertake meaningful analyses stratifying by other factors.

Again, this is an admission that there werent enough samples.

Red Flag 5: Severe dengue risk if given to seronegative people
Page 24 states, The vaccine could act as their primary infection, and the subsequent true primary... infection (which would otherwise be typically less severe) could simulate a secondary infection (which is typically more severe)

There. Page 24 of the 17 March 2016 WHO document said what Sanofi said just days ago.

There probably are more red flags after page 24 of 67, but I believe that discovering five should have been enough to convince authorities to think twice about Dengvaxia.
WHY DID AQUINOs GARIN IGNORE THEM?
Its interesting to note that on 01 April 2016, the Philippine Daily Inquirer published the article WHO approves PH rollout of dengue vaccine, even if WHO only essentially said they tolerate the rollout and that they do not necessarily approve of it.

Specifically, WHO-Philippines chief Dr. Gundo Weiler said, It is the prerogative of a country to license the product [Inq].

In short, Aquinos Garin rolled out Dengvaxia in contravention of expert opinion.


WHO reinforces warnings
As if the 17 March 2016 WHO document wasnt enough, the WHO issued another document a month later that basically reiterated the warnings.

On 14 April 2016, or several days after the Aquino Government launched the mass vaccination program, Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine delivered a report entitled Dengue Vaccine (CYD-TDV Dengvaxia) Clinical Trial Results to the World Health Organization [WHO].

According to the report (parentheses supplied),
There is a theoretical possibility that vaccination may be ineffective or may even increase risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in those who are seronegative at the time of first vaccination, regardless of age. However, there are few trial data available on older (aged 9 and up) seronegative participants to address this.
Lets translate that to plain English:
There is a chance that Dengvaxia may be useless or even increase risk of severe dengue to recipients aged 9 and up who have never had dengue, but theres an insufficient number of trial subjects to confirm this.
And theres the trial methodologys fatal flaw because when translated to really, really plain English, the April 2016 WHO report basically says:
Dengvaxia is untested on people aged 9 and older AND have never been infected with dengue.
That is, in as far as those aged 9 and up and seronegative are concerned, the drug is UNTESTED.
Now, heres the important question:
How many among the 1 million kids aged 9-10 that Aquino and Garin targeted for vaccination with Dengvaxia have been previously infected with dengue?
Dengvaxia recipients can be split into two categories:
Seropositive, or those who have had the dengue virus in their bloodstream
Seronegative, or those who never had the dengue virus in their bloodstream
Seroprevalence, meanwhile, refers to the seropositive proportion of the target population.

The studies mentioned in the previous sections indicate that Dengvaxia is considerably effective for seropositive recipients and I will not contest that. The problem, however, is what Dengvaxia does to seronegative recipients.


A Sin of Intentional Omission
A basic tenet for medical practitioners is the phrase [Harvard], First, do no harm. With respect to Dengvaxia, I think its clear that Dengvaxia must first be proven to be safe for seronegative recipients aged 9 and above.

Sanofi did not do that, the WHO confirmed that Sanofi did not do that, and the Aquino government ignored that WHO confirmation.
But then, it must be noted that we are talking about Public Health here, so there are times when compromises have to be made for the sake of the entire population.

In that regard, the WHO, after the April 2016 Meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), said:
SAGE recommended countries consider introduction of CYD-TDV only in geographic settings (national or subnational) with high endemicity, as indicated by seroprevalence of approximately 70% or greater in the age group targeted for vaccination or other suitable epidemiologic markers. The vaccine is not recommended when seroprevalence is below 50% [WHO].
Again, in plain English:
WHO recommends Dengvaxia to places where dengue is prevalent, i.e. where 70% or more of a target age group are seropositive or some other suitable standard. Do not deploy to places where less than 50% are seropositive.
Let me be categorical about this:
WHO advises AGAINST mass vaccination programs where the target population is less than 50% seropositive.
In short, DO NOT mass vaccinate if over half of the target population has never had dengue... but Garin decided to vaccinate anyway.



Seroprevalence in 4th Graders
Remember that the Aquino Government deployed Dengvaxia to 1 million 4th graders aged 9-10.
Did Aquinos DoH test the 4th graders to measure seroprevalence?
Was there a DoH study showing that over half of the 1 million 4th graders had dengue in the past? 
Were all the 1 million 4th graders subjected to an immunoglobulin test to confirm the presence of dengue virus in their bloodstream (seropositivity)?
Did the DoH even attempt to ask each of the parents of these 4th graders if their child has had dengue and if so, what proportion of the 1 million kids had the disease before?
Reactions to dengue infections vary so some of those infected may have been minimally symptomatic, so did the DoH attempt to ask parents if their child previously showed some dengue symptoms and if so, what proportion of the 1 million kids exhibited dengue symptoms in the past?
Was there even a random sampling of the 1 million kids to estimate seroprevalence with a respectable statistical confidence level?
There #DengGate issue wouldve been far less infuriating if the did any of the above. However,

I have asked several public health professionals from these areas and they said no, there were no studies like these. This is something that the Senator Gordon may want to verify with Garin.


The Aquino Government should have undertaken due diligence measures, but they didnt.

And heres the bad news: a year and a half into the mass vaccination program, [Sanofi] itself confirmed on 29 November 2017 that Dengvaxia is dangerous for use on seronegative 4th graders.

Putang ina.
Why did Aquino and Garin fail to conduct these studies before launching the mass vaccination program?

Epilogue
Because of Dengvaxia, 4th graders who have never had dengue will immediately face the risk of organ damage at their first natural infection, among other complications.

Simply stated, the #DengGate issue revolves around the deployment of an insufficiently tested and highly dangerous vaccine to 1 million Filipino children, despite the wealth of warnings that predated the mass vaccinations launch.

However, I think Sec. Ubial, Garins successor, may also be liable for this debacle. While some camps may argue that Ubial opposed Dengvaxia, the fact of the matter remains that she continued its deployment after she took over the Health Department in July 2016. Thats also something that must be explored.

With that said, I will agree this is the right time to call for a Senate Investigation.

Specifically, lets find answers for the questions:
WHY WERE AQUINO AND GARIN ON SUCH A RUSH AND WHY WAS GARIN SO POSITIVE ABOUT DENGVAXIA DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM EXPERT?
I have an answer for that, but this article is already running long so Ill leave it for the next article, which I will publish on Monday afternoon.",RJ Nieto,"December 3, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/12/denggate-aquino-garin-WHO-dengvaxia.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Trillanes Press Corps refutes Trumps narco comment?,"Senator Trillanes attacked my credibility earlier when he refuted reports saying that US President Donald Trump called him a narco.

Ooohhh, did Trillanes himself tacitly admit that we should doubt mainstream media?

TRILLANES, YOU REALLY ARE AN IDIOT.



Part of Trillanes's statement said, a significant remark like that would've been captured by mainstream media and not released through bloggers, fake news websites and tabloid columns.

You know, I was hoping that Trillanes statement includes his now-infamous ""Gentlepersons.""

Anyway, heres my reply.

That tabloid Pilipino Star Ngayon
At 12:00 AM of 30 October 2017, veteran columnist Al G. Pedroche, through his Pilipino Star Ngayon column Aksyon Ngayon, published Little Narco met with Sen. Marco  Trump, part of which reads:
Habang pasakay sa Air Force I na siyang ginamit ng Pangulo ng Amerika, tinanong daw ng isang reporter si Trump tungkol sa pagbisita ni Trillanes at ang eksaktong sagot daw ni Trump ay: The Litte Narco met with Sen. Marco.
Pedroches column was published both in print and online and I have read that column, as I read most major newspapers every morning to prepare for Karambola sa DWIZ 882 AM, where I am a co-producer and regular co-host.
A snapshot of the print version is shown below:

A snapshot of Pedroche's Pilipino Star column published on 30 October 2017.
A screenshot of the online version is also shown below:
A snapshot of Pedroche's Pilipino Star column (online version) published on 30 October 2017.

What is Pilipino Star Ngayon?
Pilipino Star Ngayon (PSN) is the leading tabloid newspaper of daily nationwide circulation in the Philippines. It is published in Filipino, and its owned and operated by PhilStar Daily, Inc., which also owns and operates the major broadsheet Philippine Star.

According to the Philippine Star, PSN is a wholesome tabloid in Filipino that came to be noted for its commitment to responsible journalism for the mass-based readership. The paper goes by the slogan ""Diyaryong Intelihente ng Masang Intelihente!"".

Originally known as Ang Pilipino Ngayon, Betty Go-Belmonte thought of coming up with a tabloid that would cater to society segments that arent being targeted by national dailies [Philstar].

In 2013 and 2014, Pilipino Star NGAYON was awarded ""Newspaper of the Year"" by Gawad Tanglaw (Gawad Tagapuring mga Akademisyan ng Aninong Gumagalaw), an award-giving body in the Philippines composed of critics, scholars, historians, and professors from different colleges and universities [Star].

The 2014 Gawad Tanglaw award was received by no less than PSN editor-in-chief Al Pedroche, the same person who wrote that Little Narco column piece.

PSN editor-in-chief Al Pedroche and provincial editor Mario Basco receive the trophy, medal, and citation from Gawad Tanglaw President Norman Llaguno at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in March 2014.

Here are some of the names of current and former columnists for Pilipino Star Ngayon:
Jarius Bondoc, the guy who broke the Roxas Campaign Planes story.
Tony Calvento of The Calvento Files
Noli de Castro, former vice president
Ben Tulfo, you know him
Korina Sanchez, you know her
Atty. Jose C. Sison of Kapag Nasa Katwiran, Ipaglaban Mo!
Dr. Loi Estrada, former senator and former first lady
By calling PSN a mere tabloid, is Trillanes questioning the credibility of these columnists?

More specifically, is Trillanes questioning the credibility of his own ally, Korina Sanchez-Roxas?

Hilarious.

ThinkingPinoy posts
At 1:55 PM of 31 October 2017 and in reaction to Pedroches column, I published a photo on ThinkingPinoy that originally included the following caption:
TRUMP CALLS TRILLANES A DRUG LORD
US President Donald J. Trump reportedly called Senator Antonio Sonny Trillanes IV a Narco, a colloquial word for a drug baron or drug lord. DOES TRUMP'S GOVERNMENT KNOW SOMETHING?
Initially, my original post didnt explicitly cite Pedroches column as I felt its unnecessary, with Pilipino Star Ngayon being a newspaper of national circulation. 
Some readers, however, requested for my source, so I tried to retrieve Pedroches column and voila! I discovered that the PSN took it down.

PSN, however, did not issue a retraction or even an erratum, so its safe to conclude that PSN stands by what PSN editor-in-chief Pedroche wrote. Moreover, the mere deletion of its online version does not in any way affect the fact that PSN has published the column on paper.

If a news site deletes an article without an accompanying erratum, does that mean it also retracts that article?

No. It doesnt.

For one, I highly doubt that PSN has recalled or will recall all the newspapers it printed on October 30th. Hence, Pedroches claim still stands.

I checked for cached copies of Pedroches column, and I archived it. To read the archived cached copy of Pedroches column, click here.

Trillanes reacts
At 4:37 PM of 01 November 2017, Sen. Antonio Trillanes published the graphic shown below:

The graphic has an accompanying caption that reads:
""That's fake news. They can't even cite the news outfit that conducted the interview. In the first place, those senior US government officials would not meet with me if I had dubious credentials. It goes to show that this RJ Nieto a.k.a Thinking Pinoy is not thinking after all. Moreover, a significant remark like that would've been captured by mainstream media and not released through bloggers, fake news websites and tabloid columns. Let us be more discerning about these things.""
Lets break it down.

In light of the previous sections, Trillanes basically said three things:
Pilipino Star Ngayon publishes fake news because it cant even cite the news outfit that conducted the interview.
Senior US government officials would not meet with Trillanes if he had dubious credentials.
A significant remark wouldve been captured by mainstream media and not through bloggers, fake news websites, and tabloid columns.

First, Pilipino Star Ngayon as Fake News
One thing is clear at this point: ThinkingPinoy published the narco comment based on Pedroches PSN column.

Now, Im curious as to how PhilStar Daily Inc. will defend Pilipino Star Ngayons Al Pedroche.

After all, a newspaper that has been given Gawad Tanglaw awards for Newspaper of the Year for two consecutive years (2013 and 2014) cannot be considered fake news, as that would imply that theres something anomalous about Gawad Tanglaw.

Surely, the critics, scholars, and academicians behind Gawad Tanglaw will beg to disagree.

Moreover, its hypocritical for Trillanes to demand such standards when he himself is guilty of forwarding dubious claims in the very recent past.

Take, for example, the BPI Julia Vargas issue , where he claimed that then presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte amassed over a billion pesos in ill-gotten wealth. Asked for his source, he executed an affidavit stating that he got the information from a certain Joseph de Mesa who, in turn, got it from an unnamed AMLC official [TP: BangkoSerye].

Mister Trillanes, should I have cited Joseph de Mesa too? Tigilan mo nga ako.


Second, Trillanes credibility
Joseph de Mesa. Enough said.

Partida, hindi ko pa diyan sinama si Matobato.

Third, captured by mainstream
Is Pilipino Star Ngayon, a Best Filipino Newspaper awardee, not good enough for you?

ThinkingPinoy did not break that news: it was Pilipino Star Ngayon. Hence, the question should be whether Pilipino Star ngayon is part of mainstream media. 

While there is no strict definition of what belongs to mainstream media or not, it must be recalled that Pilipino Star Ngayons Ely Saludar was made president of the Malacaang Press Corps, replacing Tony Velasquez of ABS-CBN [Star]. 

If thats not mainstream enough for Trillanes, I do not know what else is. 

And surely, the tabloid reporters belonging to the Malacaang Press Corps will refute Trillanes claim that tabloids publish fake news. 

But wait, there's more!

Today, broadsheet columnist Mary Ann Reyes of the Philippine Star, on her 01 November 2017 column, wrote:
While onboard Air Force One, Trump was reportedly asked by a reporter about Trillanes visit to the US and this is what the President said: The little narco met with Senator Marco (referring to US Senator Marco Rubio).
So now, Mister Trillanes, is the broadsheet Philippine Star still not mainstream enough for you?
Wow! Ang taas ng standards ni Kuya. Wish ko lang e inapply niya yang standards na yan sa sarili niya.

But the story doesnt end here because I noticed something really fishy.


Sneaky! Sneaky!
This afternoon, [GMA News] and the [Philippine Star] published news articles about Trillanes statement-slash-denial, and I saw a very interesting pattern.

Both articles contain the following basic talking points and basically in the same order:
A reference to Mary Ann Reyes 01 November Philippine Star column.
Quotes from Trillanes denial stament.
References to 31 October 2017 Adobo Chronicles satirical article about the same issue.
References to 31 October 2017 ThinkingPinoys Narco post.
Interestingly, both articles DID NOT mention Pedroches 30 October 2017 PSN column, which pre-dated the Adobo Chronicles article.

Now, the two reporters could have argued that they didnt get to read Pedroches PSN piece because it was deleted.

The two reporters apparent omission of the Pilipino Star Ngayon column could have been an honest mistake. After all, Hanlons Razor [University of California] states:
Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
But surely, neither of the reporters will admit to being stupid, so malice, though not yet a certitude at this point, could have been present.

But wait, there's more!

On 31 October 2017, or a day before the two articles were published, veteran journalist Jojo Robles of the [Manila Standard], another mainstream broadsheet, talked about Pedroches piece when he wrote:
According to the columnist, Trump told the reporter during a chat aboard Air Force One that, indeed, the little narco met with Senator Marco.
That is, the two reporters seemingly ignored not only the original PSN piece, but also another column piece from another mainstream publication.

Did the two reporters commit the same honest mistake twice? 

I dont know, but any self-respecting beat reporter should read all the major stories in the major dailies before she goes to work. 

As far as I can see, they either acted with malice, or theyre simply incompetent and lazy.

But who would admit to being incompetent and lazy?

A Possible Damage Control Plan
To help get a better grasp of whats going on, let me summarize the basic chain of events:
October 30th: Pilipino Star Ngayon publishes article claiming Trump called Trillanes a narco.
October 31st : ThinkingPinoy, using PSN as a source, reported that Trump allegedly called Trillanes a ""narco.
October 31st: Manila Standard cites the Pilipino Star column piece.
October 31st: Adobo Chronicles satirizes the narco story.
November 1st: Broadsheet Philippine Star picks up the narco story.
Now, the two news articles did not mention steps 1 and 3, so that their timeline will only include Steps 2, 4, and 5.

In short, a possible public relations damage control plan for the Trillanes camp could be inspired by what happened to Manila Times columnist Yen Makabenta last month, where the latter got duped by Fake News about a supposed quote from United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.

Trillanes' potential strategy can be described using the following steps:
First, find a way to get the Pedroches PSN column deleted, making it appear that the column piece never existed.
Second, make it appear that Adobo Chronicles broke the news, which would basically discredit the story because Adobo Chronicles is widely known to be a satirical news site.
Third, with the Adobo satirical article up, discredit any further mention of the narco quote by making it appear that whoever will write about it got duped by Adobo.
Fourth, to stave off claims that PSN broke the news, discredit PSN by calling it a mere tabloid, without directly naming PSN so Trillanes can avoid incurring the wrath of the Philstar Group.
Fifth, focus the attention and blame on ThinkingPinoy. After all, finding mainstream media outlets to join in this attack against ThinkingPinoy will be easy.
In short, the strategy revolves around the premise that ThinkingPinoy and Adobo Chronicles broke the story, even if its Pilipino Star Ngayon that did and even if the Manila Standard has referred to PSNs column a day later.

Just like what my friend Sass Sasot said:
If the Little Narco story is fake news, why can't Trillanes confront PHILIPPINE STAR about it? Bakit si ThinkingPinoy ay pinag-iinitan niya, eh Philippine Star ang nag-publish?
But theres one fatal flaw in this possible plan: Trillanes initial choice of mainstream allies.

Inday Sara Duterte reveals Trillanes Press Corps?
Trillanes initially found two (unwitting?) allies: 
Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez of GMA news 
Kristine Joy Patag of the Philippine Star.
These two reporters wrote the two denial-articles published yesterday.

Now, lets simplify the question:
Did the two reporters (Stars Patag and GMAs Alvarez) intentionally omit two crucial sources (PSN and Standard) of the little narco comment?
I checked the list of Philippine Star news articles authored by Kristine Joy Patag and I found out that a vast majority of them are about or are sourced from the Senate, suggesting that Patag is a Senate beat reporter. I also checked the list of GMA News articles and found out the same about Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez, i.e. she appears to be another Senate beat reporter.

Yes, Alvarez and Patag appear to be in the Senate Beat, i.e. they are focused mainly on news coming from or about the Senate of the Philippines.

Now, recall that presidential daughter and Davao City mayor Inday Sara Duterte earlier this month wrote a Facebook comment, shown below:



Part of that comment reads:
Wala si Trillanes pag weekend, walang mainstream media for a presscon kung weekend. Ang bayad ke Trillanes, Monday to Friday before evening news cut-off. Most people watch news and read newspapers Monday to Friday.
It's worthy to note that NO ONE among the senate beat reporters, where Patag and Alvarez belong, reported about Inday Sara's comment, even if it directly concerns them.

News blackout much?

Well, one things for sure: Patags and Alvarezs respective articles made the evening news cut-off.

And did I say that neither of them attempted to contact me for my side of the story? 

Well, what's new?

Bam Aquino, ikaw ang makulit sa pagkuha kamo dapat ng both sides, so papaluin mo kaya yung dalawang ungas na yan?


Trillanes' payroll?
It's funny how some mainstream outlets claimed during the #CocoyGate senate hearing that they have internal ombudsmen who check for abuses within their their ranks. However,  I have never heard, seen, or read anybody among them getting fired for corruption.

Should we start canonizing a number of mainstream journalists? 

At this rate, yeah, I think we should! 

Now, wouldnt it be fair to ask the question:
Are Kristine Joy Patag of the Philippine Star and Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez of GMA News part of Trillanes alleged payroll?
I cant say for sure, and I leave that job to the internal ombudsmen of the concerned news outlets, assuming that such internal ombudsmen exist.

But I am a nice guy, so let me help these theoretically existent internal ombudsmen a bit.

Who is GMA News Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez?
GMAs Kathrina Charmaine Alvarez drew flak last month when she broke the news about Senator Trillanes visit to a Singaporean Bank.

On 19 September 2017, Alvarez wrote No such account, Singapore bank tells Trillanes [GMA News].

Alvarezs article was accompanied by a [Twitter video] showing Trillanes entering the Alexandra, Singapore branch of DBS bank. Alvarez did not attribute this video to anyone else, so she must have taken the video herself.

That is, unless the Alvarez is based in Singapore, she must have flown to Singapore to cover Trillanes trip.

Supporting this theory is a line from Alvarezs article that reads:
The branch manager then talked to Trillanes for about 10 minutes.
From this, we can say that Alvarez was there to witness the event, as this appears to be Alvarezs direct observation of events as they unfolded.

So who paid for Alvarezs trip to Singapore? The Philippine Star? Antonio Trillanes? Who?

Trillanes has his own Press Corps? Kinabog si Duterte?! Taray!

Is Alvarez one of the reporters on the Trillanes payroll that Inday Sara Duterte alleged?

GMA News Internal Ombudsman, GO!!!

But wait! Were not done yet.


Who is Philippine Stars Kristine Joy Patag?
According to her own LinkedIn account, Kristine Joy Patag graduated with a BA Communication Arts degree from the University of the Philippines in 2010. Straight out of college, she joined the Office of the President of the Philippines as a Presidential Staff Officer II.

She was promoted to Presidential Staff Officer III in May 2014, and left the Office of the President when her principal, President Benigno PNoy Aquino III stepped down in June 2016.

As a presidential staff officer, she said her tasks include:
Drafting messages and correspondence for the signature of the President.
Drafting action letters, transmittal memorandums, and referrals to other units for the signature of the Head of Office.
Researching, verifying, and coordinating with concerned offices accordingly.
Editing and proofreading diplomatic correspondences sent to Heads of States for the signature of the President.
That is, for the first six years of her work life and using the standards of todays political oppositon, Patag was officially a government propagandist, similar to the Mikael de Lara Co, whom I wrote about in April 2016 when he lamely defended the Aquino Government for the Kidapawan Carnage [TP: BigasHindiBala], or when the Aquino government shot starving farmers in Mindanao.

But I digress.

Going back to topic, where did Patag go right after she left Malacaang?

I smell conflict of interest, like that thing about Karen Davila.

After leaving the Palace in June 2016, Patag joined Businessworld in August 2016. 

Businessworld is a sister publication of Pilipino Star Ngayon and the Philippine Star.

With that said, heres a question:
Judging from her resume, Patags career is so far defined by her lengthy stint at the Office of PNoy, so just how much influence does her former Liberal Party allies exert on her today?
More importantly, it is to be noted that Patag and Pedroche essentially belong to the same organization today so...
How would the senior columnist Al Pedroche, who has been a part of Philstar Inc since its inception in the 1980s, react to junior reporter Kristine Patags seemingly willful snobbing of his article?
What would I give to have a peek at the Philippine Stars conference rooms tomorrow! [TP]

"Contreras was not ""fired"": he was disinvited, just like Leni Robredo","I started ThinkingPinoy with the intention of talking about Politics and little else. The problem, however, is that I have not seen a drama queen of your caliber before. I didn't want to respond to your round-the-clock passive-aggressive dilawan-type status posts because I hate drama, except when that drama involves a national issue.

I write because I want to help people make better political decisions. I do not write to gain sympathy and attention. Truth be told, I do not really care if other writers have other intentions, but their freedom to choose their reason for writing ends where they start trampling on me and my work.

IMPORTANT NOTE: I really do not want to talk about this issue but the attacks have gotten so vicious that it might affect the reputation of my blog among my social media followers and it might also harm the reputation not only of Karambola, but DWIZ as well. Yes, I have to address this before the issue gets out of hand. 



It's been a week since you left the show, yet you haven't stopped ranting about it. Truth be told, kulang na lang e mahiya sa iyo si Tisha Bautista: she's never appeared as bitter as you.

I initially told myself, Okay, he just needs to vent, so let him vent. I watched you disparage the show and the network not only through your profile page, but also through the different social media chat groups, some of which I am also a member of.

I tried to be as patient and understanding to you as possible. In one of the chatrooms, I even gently told you:
With all due respect Prof. Ton, I think some introspection is in order.
To which, you replied:
I have. The reason given to me was exactly what I said. Leni wanted me out. What is there to introspect? It is weird since it looks like a delayed reaction. I have not been talking about Leni. I did not personally attack her. In any case thanks for the reminder.
At that point, I realized, Wow, he really thinks there's nothing wrong with him.

I asked Jojo if that's true, and he said it's not. I found out that you just cherry-picked that statement and disregarded everything else that he said.

The problem: the Leni thing constitutes a very small portion of what Jojo really told you.


I kept my silence in spite of that, out of my respect for the more senior co-producers. I was made a co-producer of the show before you got disinvited.
The problem, however, is that you allowed your diva-hood to get the better of you when you used your Manila Times column to bring the drama to a whole new level. I do not know if you named names in your column, but let's not kid ourselves: we all know who and what you're talking about.

So I apologize if I didn't read your article-rant in its entirety because simply reading the title made me vomit my innards.

But one of my long-time OFW readers did and she messaged me about it. She said:
Araw-araw, naririndi na ako kay Contreras. Hindi pa nakuntento, sinulat pa sa column niya.
It's sickeningly juvenile, Professor, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I have become a co-producer of the show and I don't like the way you disparage the show's and the station's respective reputations.

This will be the last time that I will talk about this issue, and I leave it to the public to decide who's telling the more believable version of events.

That is, to set things straight, let me tell you my version of the story behind your leaving Karambola sa DWIZ.


Fired?
You weren't fired because firing you requires the existence of an employee-employer relationship vis-a-vis the Karambola sa DWIZ radio show, a relationship that is non-existent because there is no contract between you and anybody in Karambola's management or that of the radio station. 

In short, you were Karambola's regular guest.

That is, when one of the show's heads, veteran journalist Jojo A. Robles, told you that he was letting you go, he meant he was disinviting you from the show.

Yes, the operative word here is not termination, but disinvitation.

That is, Karambola simply withdrew your invitation to be a guest. Nothing more, nothing less.

Yes, Prof. Conteraras, you were disinvited, just like what the President did to VP Leni Robredo in Malacanang's vin d'honneur earlier in January [SunStar].
Now, some people may be asking why you weren't offered a contract. That's a fair question. Well, the hosts told me that you weren't offered a contract because they feared that you're one gigantic drama queen. 

It's safe to say that after your week-long-and-still-ongoing-and-still-intensifying rants, those fears are not unfounded.

Now that that has been clarified, let's answer the next logical question: Why were you disinvited?

You fail at instrospection, professor, so let me do the introspection for you.



""Disinvitation""
I do not know if you yourself claimed that your anti-Leni Robredo stance caused your disinvitation, but it appears that most netizens believe that Leni tried to find ways to kick you out of it.

That is mostly incorrect. 

I have spoken with the team and while it is true that someone in management raised the issue of your unabashed hatred for Robredo, that in itself is not reason enough for them to let you go. I myself love criticizing Robredo, perhaps as much as you do, yet they decided to invite me to the team.

Leni or no Leni, the decision to disinvite you from the show came even before I entered the picture. You see, the show's producers have been planning to disinvite you months before that fateful Monday morning. It was not because of any new development, but because of chronic issues that the shows' hosts and the station's management found, issues that adversely affect the quality of the show's content.
The most senior producer talked to you that morning to deliver the bad news as gently as possible. He said he's at least giving you the rest of the week so you won't be embarrassed. You said you'll just leave right then and there, and the producer thought the matter has been settled and it's time to just move on for both sides.

The show did not announce your exit and you weren't even prevented to make up an alibi to explain your exit. For one, you could have just told the public that you decided to leave the show because of scheduling issues and got the entire thing over with.

But no, you announced your ""termination"" minutes before the live stream, exposing us to a barrage of angry comments that lasted the entire show.

No, Prof. Tonton, that isn't how grown-ups behave. Yes, I myself am childish at times, but you're older than I am: you should know better.

The problem is that you don't.

Specifics
You know what, I was the one who defended you as they were mulling your disinvitation. But they have become so sick and tired of you that no amount of defending could have saved your neck. But sick and tired is too vague a term, so let me list down the specific reasons one by one.

First, Pre-show Prep Issues
There was a general impression that you do not perform sufficient pre-show preparation. There have been many times when your comments on particular issues consist basically of motherhood statements that provide little value to the listener. While complete mastery of every new political issue is not expected, the show's producers expect commentators to give insights that occasionally elicit Ay, oo nga no!? from listeners.

For example, there have been more than a few instances where co-host Conrad Banal interrupted you with snarky comments. Those snarky comments were subtle instructions for you to level up your game. The problem, however, is that you weren't able to take the hint despite being a year into the show.

Second, Credentialism
You also have a penchant for resorting to credentialism when you run out of motherhood statements to blurt out. You love to shamelessly invoke your academic background, which in effect tells the audience that they have to believe you regardless of how insipid your commentary is. That's just like ABS-CBN News insisting that they're credible just because they wont this and that award.

At the end of the day, nobody cares about where you're from: what they care about is the quality of your ideas.

But the problem is further exacerbated by your unnecessary penchant for jargon. Professor, our audience do not have formal training in the social sciences, so you have to speak in a language that they readily understand. You don't do that.

Third, Hijacking Topics
Your peers in the show also felt selfishness on your part whenever you hijack topics. Take, for example, the time when you changed the topic from the Marawi Clash to e-Jeepneys. I mean, come on, e-Jeepneys? The hosts were trying to bring back the topic to Marawi, but you interrupted them so much and so often that they weren't able to. For almost half an hour, we were forced to listen about your thing with e-Jeepneys as we watched the Facebook Live viewer count plunge like Leni Robredo's Trust Ratings.

You know why Conrad sometimes suddenly talks about economics? It's to shut you up, because the show's hosts notice that you talk less when economics is the topic. That's how bad the situation has become.

Fourth, Airtime Hogging
Despite the previous two points, you chose to airtime hog: you love listening to yourself too much. There have been more than a few occasions where you did 5-minute monologues without allowing anyone among the co-hosts to talk. It would have been acceptable if those were 5 minutes worth of mind-boggling insights, but they weren't.

Haven't you noticed those episodes when Jojo or Conrad or Jonat barely talked for an entire segment? It's because of you. Worse, you don't even let anybody speak while you're in between thoughts, and you do this by repeating sentences over and over until your brain catches up with your mouth.

Fifth, Egotism
Another issue that everyone raised was your humongous ego. While egotism in itself is not necessarily bad, your ego has adversely affected the quality of discussion in Karambola. Karambola has slowly become more toxic because of it, and the show's hosts managed to mitigate the toxicity only by getting out of your way. But the show is called Karambola: a monologue is no karambola.

Take, for example, that time when we criticized ABS-CBN/ANC's editorial decision-making when they chose to pit Jover Laurio with a peripheral figure to the #CocoyGate issue. You did not let us expound on how she broke the law and instead forced the conversation to focus on Jover's penchant for name-calling. Your contention that her calling you a balahura is important may be true, but it surely is less important than Laurio violating the Revised Penal Code.

Sixth, Sense of Entitlement
This bears repeating: you were just a regular guest. Despite this, you usurped editorial control by inviting other people to substitute for you when you're out of town. That's just like lending someone your precious car, only for that person to lend it to someone else without even asking for your permission.

Professor Ton, do not give to others what does not belong to you.

Seventh, Sub-optimal Ratings
A radio show costs serious money to produce and broadcast and just like TV shows, ratings decide the fate of the show. You were brought into Karambola because you had a relatively massive online following. I have spoken with the show's hosts and they said it's the primary reason why you were invited to the show. The problem, however, is that your following did not translate into significantly better ratings.

The numbers speak for themselves.

Eighth, Integrity Issue
One of the show's hosts even told me that you said months ago that your close friend Joyce Ramirez can help bring in sponsorship deals to the show, a sort-of promise that never materialized. What's more interesting, however, are your constant efforts to reconcile me with Joyce, something that I cannot imagine will happen.

You offered, in multiple occasions and with the other hosts as witnesses, to organize a meeting with Joyce and me so we can patch things up. What I do not understand, however, is what we should patch up.

My #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy articles reported about the duplicity of the Liberal Party and Joyce Ramirez, and I do not understand how a meeting with Joyce will correct what she has already allegedly done.

I specifically remember that time when I spoke with Joyce's post-Roxas politician-client and warned him of my article that would be published days later because I hate dealing collateral damage. 

Yes, we're talking about the same Joyce Ramirez who allegedly headed LP-Akbayan black propaganda social media campaigns, where Mar Roxas reportedly tried to pin all the blame over Mamasapano on PNoy just to salvage his 2016 presidential ambitions.

Right after I said that, you brazenly ordered me, right in front of that politician's face and with several other people as witnesses, that I should stop writing against Joyce Ramirez.

We were all stunned. Who are you to censor my blog? I think even that politician was stunned, as evidenced by the politician's camp reportedly firing Ramirez a few days later.

After the article's publication and ensuing brouhaha, Ramirez reportedly told the politician that she knew of the article's existence days before its publication because you told her about it yourself.

Did you divulge confidential information to the exact person who I was about to expose?

Tonton, which side are you on? Duterte's side, as long as it's not against PR operator Joyce Ramirez? What do you owe Joyce, really? 

My little birds told me a few things and many others, but I'd rather not mention them anymore.

A Final Word
Yes, Professor, I partially agree that your unabashed hatred for Leni Robredo is a factor behind your disinvitation, but that reason was thrown in only because the producers still had enough remaining sympathy for you, enough for them to feel the need to protect your large and fragile ego.

They gave you a full year to fix your act, but they felt that you believed that you were so good, you didn't have to get better. They partially agree with you: you did not improve indeed.

The producers were hoping that you would exit quietly, just like what everyone did before you. You know why job interviewers interviewers in general reject applicants who trash-talk their previous companies? First, because people generally hate whiny people. Second, because those applicants are likely to do the same thing if and when they leave.

Jojo Robles, Conrad Banal, Mon Tulfo, and many other bigger radio and TV celebrities were once fired from their stations, but they had the decency to avoid whining about it. Instead, they just moved on and looked for better opportunities elsewhere.

But unlike them, you had to whine like a child who's got his candy stolen.

Professor Tonton, you are years older than I am, and people expect you to display an EQ that's at least higher than a 32-year-old's.

With these said, will you choose to finally show some grace in adversity, or will you continue to whine until kingdom come?

It's up to you but if choose the latter, do us a favor by not whining in front of PR operator Joyce Ramirez, your dear friend.

I have spoken to the show's producers about it and they said that in keeping with media tradition, they will not utter a word. But I am TP: I do not share the same level of fortitude as my co-producers.

You can whine till kingdom come but I'm sorry, you are not the most important topic on earth.

Please, Professor Contreras, let this be the last of it.

That's all I have to say about the matter.",RJ Nieto,"October 28, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/10/contreras-was-not-fired-he-was.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#CocoyGate: Mar Roxas' special assignments for PR operator Joyce Ramirez,"Hey Mar Roxas and Joyce Ramirez, if you want more after this, just let me know.

During my first two hours speaking at the #CocoyGate #SenateHearing and possibly owing to first time jitters, the #NasaanAngPangulo scandal accidentally slipped my tongue. I was really very nervous then, and since I swore to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, I virtually told every truth that was in my mind at the time.

In PR terms, I think that slip of mine was a miscalculation, no matter how minor. That slip could have totally derailed the #CocoyGate issue, so I was really relieved that it didnt. Regardless, mainstream media tried to report on it: tried because the articles that came out were essentially slanted in favor of the accused, with none of them  except GMA News (Thank you!)  asking for my side.

Truth be told, I have already lost interest on the #NasaanAngPangulo issue, until one of my little birds told me a few days ago that the PR operator mentioned in my article  PR Asia Worldwides Joyce Ramirez  ordered her fleet of social media allies to attack me online. I think my very highly placed little birds have no motive to lie, so I think its reasonable to say, from my end, that Ramirez committed an egregious mistake.

You see, I am not the kind of guy who lays all his cards on the table. I always leave a couple of aces up my sleeve for use if and when the need arises. Suffice it to say, let me use one of them against Ramirez today.

NOTE: I didn't proofread this article anymore. I'm too tired already.
The Year was 2015
In the February 2017 ThinkingPinoy article #NasaanAngPangulo: Mamasapano, Mar Roxas Ambition, and a PR operator, I explained that a friend, former National Youth Commissioner and former MTRCB member Michael Mike Acebedo Lopez, told me a really good story.

Lopez said that in 2015, then DILG Secretary Mar Roxas, in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidential ambitions, engaged in a multi-million peso black propaganda campaign against then President Benigno PNoy Aquino, a campaign that aimed at pinning all the blame on the latter over the SAF44-Mamasapano Scandal, effectively shielding Roxas from Mamasapano-related bad press.

According to Lopez, close Roxas aide and then DILG Usec. Tomasito Tom Villarin commissioned publicist (i.e. PR operator) Joyce Ramirez to launch a Mamasapano-related Twitter campaign focused specifically against PNoy, in the hopes of minimizing the bad publicity that his principal Mar Roxas, a de facto superior of the SAF 44 policemen, would receive.

Lopez did not specifically name Ramirez, but other sources provided me with that information.
Lopez, who has a hatred of all things yellow, said he helped Ramirez by providing a list of Twitter hashtag, one of which was the legendary #NasaanAngPangulo, the hashtag used for the anti-Pnoy campaign that was launched at exactly 6:00 PM Manila on 29 January 2015.

Lopez said Ramirez maintains business connections with major social media players, which allows her to force any issue into the Twitter trending list and like clockwork, #NasaanAngPangulo trended worldwide shortly after its launch.

As evidence, I provided an excel file that was last modified in 2015, showing Joyce Ramirez as its author. The excel file basically used the #NasaanAngPangulo campaign as case study that she used for pitching her services to other politicians.

Ramirez orders an attack?
Roxas has since denied links with Ramirez and #NasaanAngPangulo. But that's expected.

Meanwhile, Ramirez reacted to my revelation at the Senate with a statement, part of which reads:
For the first time in my life: I felt like an activist. I had to do something and ask the question: WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT? I was actually surprised that it became a viral hit. Let me tell you now, that was unintentional. We just posed the question out to the socialverse, hey WHERE is the President? Nothing is wrong with asking a question.
Referring to ThinkingPinoy, Ramirez also said:
Only fame whore, social climber would invent such claim.
Unlike many people, I am immune to name calling, so Ill let that second quotation go. Actually, I was even tempted to let the entire thing go because Ramirez, while an interesting figure, is a very small fish to fry. I think shes a waste of cooking oil.

But based on what my little birds told me, her recent actions warrant an Armageddon.
According to my little birds, Ramirez recently ordered her fleet of pro-Duterte influencers to attack my page. I dont exactly know what triggered her, especially since I never really mentioned her or anything related to her during the past couple of weeks.

Well, a few minor social media players tried to attack me recently. They called the #CocoyGate Senate Hearing a little Poe-Cayetano 2022 show, which, I feel, shows total disrespect for Senator Grace Poe who could not have handled the hearing more fairly. (Thank you, Grace.)

Are they part of Ramirezs fleet? I dont know, but quoting Roosevelt:
In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.
Well, Ill fart on them rainbows that smell like World Peace with a hint of cinnamon.

Like this, Joyce. LIKE THIS. 

Ramirez and PR Asia Worldwide
Before we go any further, its worthy to note that Ramirez used #NasaanAngPangulo on her own companys twitter accounts:


Ramirez's company Publicy Asia / PRAsiaWorldwide owns @INTERXN

She even appeared to be glad that the hashtag was featured on TV Patrol!



But of course, those two screenshots are just circumstantial evidence.

We need more... and more is what I'll give you.


Anyone other than Lopez?
My mentor, Manila Standard columnist and former editor-in-chief Jojo Robles, taught me how to treat sources. He said I should always wait for a second independent source to corroborate what my first source said. And because I am a very obedient student, I looked for not only one, but two other sources for this issue.

DISCLAIMERS:
I have several other sources aside from Lopez and these two, but I will not be using the information they gave just yet. As I've said, I don't lay all my cards at once. 
I will take every step to ensure that none of Ramirezs post-Roxas clients will get entangled in this article, for the simple reason that they may not have been aware of Ramirezs proclivities. 
If your name somehow gets entangled, don't blame me. Ask Joyce. 
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the two additional sources I have for this article claim that they used to be part of Ramirezs social media influencer fleet, but they had a falling out because Ramirez is a cheapskate, i.e. they said she doesn't pay people well.


First Source spills beans on #NasaanAngPangulo
I shall conceal the identities of the other two sources because doing otherwise may jeopardize their livelihood. I will, however, provide some relevant  VERY RELEVANT  screenshots.

Both sources, who we shall call Source 1 and Source 2, were part of Ramirez's fleet of social media influencers, i.e. they were part of the twitter campaigns Ramirez commandeered.
Referring to Ramirez, Source 1 said:
Nakalimutan nya yata na madaldal sya dati. Hahahaha! Kaya tigilan niya mga paninira n'ya dahil madaldal sya! Hahaha!
Source 1 then gave me three screenshots allegedly showing Ramirezs instant messages (IMs) dated 29 January 2015. I have redacted other IMs to protect my sources identity, then combined Ramirezs IMs into one neat graphic.


""INTERXN"" is what Ramirez calls her fleet of social media influencers.


Based on the screenshots, Ramirez wrote:
We have a special assignment. Can we trend 6PM later? It is special political operations.
Six p.m. of 29 January 2015? That's exactly what Lopez told me!

Ramirez added:
Our assignment is to amplify that PNoy snubbed the 44 dead policemen.
Ramirez appears to be referring to the arrival of the bodies of 44 Special Action Forces (SAF) slain in the botched Mamasapano Clash. Pnoy was absent during the arrival ceremony, attending instead the opening of a car plant somewhere in South Luzon.

Ramirez wrote:
Tweets about heroism, PNoy not showing up at the rites, being a coward, shame, etc.
I think its clear now that the supposed Twitter campaign is against Pnoy.

Big money on the line for the team as much as P250K (Php 250,000) each but per INTERXN policy each must present work delivery in prep for the elections.
Joyce may have been referring to her influencer fleet when she said team and the payment per influence when she said P250K.

Interestingly, she said in prep for the elections. Was she intending to use a supposedly confidential black propaganda operation as marketing material from the onset?

I mean, I dislike Roxas, but I kinda feel bad for him in this particular aspect of the matter.

But were not done yet.


#WishKoKayPNoy: 2nd Source, 2nd Campaign
My second source, another former member of Ramirezs social media influencer fleet, provided me screenshots of their group chats, where Ramirez appeared to be providing specific instructions for yet another anti-Pnoy social media black propaganda campaign.



In the screenshot, Ramirez wrote:
Wag masyado hard sell kay Mar ha and pumili kayo matinong photos wag yung mukang stunt PR (sic). Act like news outlets.
Ooohh, instructions to create fake news?
The IM was accompanied by a sample tweet that reads:
Respeto at Hustisya para sa Fallen 44. #WishKoKayPNoy
The sample tweet included photos of Roxas taken during the SAF 44 arrival ceremonies.

OOHHH, SNEAKY! Aktibista ka lang talaga, Joyce? Talaga lang?

Orders from up above?
Based on the evidence, Ramirez appeared to have machinated at least two Twitter campaigns against Roxass own principal, President Benigno Aquino III, with the second campaign launched barely a week after the first.


Based on another screenshot, Joyce was acting on someone elses orders, presumably from DILG Usec. Tom Villarin, basing on Lopezs information.

Ramirez wrote:
Eto daw #WishKoKayPNoy inject positive images na si Mar Roxas ang humarap sa burol so paki-Google photos positive spin for Mar pero wag hard sell or halata. Photos na lang ikalat no words let the people comment wag tayo.
One of her influencers replied with a photo, and Ramirez responded with:
Yes, mga ganyan. Discreet kundi aawayin tayo ng lahat.
Judging from the 08 February #WishKoKayPnoy sample tweet, this exchange of IMs happened around 08 February 2015.

And yes, it appears that Mar Roxas is indeed the beneficiary of both Twitter campaigns.

But Pnoys loyal minions in Malacaang seem to have caught wind of Ramirezs online operations.

PNoy's Malacaang smells something fishy
On 18 February 2015, or a little over a week later, Ramirez re-emerged in the group chat.



Ramirez wrote:
Hello if any of you posted something anti government kindly delete cos people are accusing us of destabilization. Remember to always keep neutral. Delete muna any post na may government related content cos we are being monitored daw by government kahit wala naman tayo pinost na masama for your safety thanks.
Ok, hold on one second!

FIRST, its clear that the two twitter campaigns #NasaanAngPangulo and #WishKoKayPnoy were intended to discredit then President Aquino, so I do not understand how Ramirez could say that theyre not doing anything bad.

SECOND, its also difficult to understand how Ramirezs fleet of influencers can keep neutral, since the two campaigns specifically are black propaganda. Thus, I can only surmise that Ramirez meant the exercise of greater subtlety among her minions.

THIRD, its interesting that Ramirez seems to have acknowledged the presence of a Pnoy-era online monitoring team. Was Ramirez referring to the Malacaang Call Center that former PCDSPO chief Ricky Carandang reportedly created? Was Ramirez referring to the the same Aquino-era Malacaang Call Center where Palace-sponsored cyber operations  including troll operations  allegedly took place?

And by the way, Pinoy Ako Blogs Jover Laurio was seen with Carandang in 2015.

Laurio with Carandang. 


Coincidence? Ask Roosevelt.

Regardless, whats clear here is that whatever deal Ramirez had with the Roxas camp was more than just a one-off affair and that Ramirez loves sipping her own Kool-Aid.

But it gets even more interesting from here.


Like a scorned lover
At some point, Ramirez seems to have become unhappy with her deal with Roxas camp, as evidenced by a screenshot of her chat with one of her then-closest influencers, provided to me by no less than that influencer himself/herself.


Apparently referring to Roxas, Ramirez wrote:
""Di man lang niya isipin puwede natin siya ituro for destabilization.""
In an earlier conversation and based on pronoun antecedents, the influencer asked her if its really Mar Roxas who ordered the black propaganda campaigns:


Ramirez replied:
Told yah. Its him.
According to the screenie, the influencer even offered to save the pictures as evidence.

Ramirez also wrote:
Hard mo na masusuka tao sa kanya not branding.
Judging from his screenshot, Ramirez ordered the influencer to hard-sell Mar Roxas, which is the total opposite of her orders at the beginning, which was to subtly sell Mar Roxas and nothing more.

Hard selling means blatantly and shamelessly promoting something. This tactic is generally frowned upon by the PR community because it is usually off-putting for target audience.

Essentially, Ramirez seems to have instructed her influencers to hard sell Roxas, i.e. still fulfill her agreement with the Roxas camp while sabotaging it at the same time.

Ramirez apparently went as far as threatening to preserve evidence about their transactions when she wrote:
Beat your own prof losers. Evidence pa ha. DILG making orders against PNoy so stupid.
Yes, at this point, it appears that Ramirez is sabotaging her own client.

It's interesting that Ramirez has so much confidence on her PR skills. I mean, if she's really good, then why am I writing this article right now?

But how did it come to this point? Why did these even happen?

Money. Money, Money
Another screenshot from 25 February 2015 provides more insight about the why behind the what:

Based on the image, Ramirez wrote:
Ibabasura ko yang Mar hanggang ngayon di nagbabayad puro utos ang DILG ang kakapal.Ramirez, presumably out of anger or sheer disappointment, called Mar a squatter.
But another screenshot suggests that her vendetta didnt end there:


Ramirez wrote:
Villarin DILG Usec. Wala bayad as if. Sa sobrang galit ko pinadala ko kay VP Binay.
Ramirez posted an image showing her message to then Vice-president Jejomar Binays camp, which reads:
BayanMuna and the reaffirmist groups are one of the primary movers behind the oust Pnoy activities. They join VP Binay, Peping Cojuangco, GMA, the Napoles senators and corrupt businessmen like Bobby Ongpin in an unholy alliance to use the #saf44 as a way to oust PNoy. To the SAF, PNP, and AFP remember that these communists are the same ones responsible together with the NPA of (sic) killing thousands of your brothers in arms. Huwag magpapagamit sa mga communista!!!
I am not sure if Ramirez was telling the truth here, especially since she appears to be spiteful during the times those messages were sent. Whats clear, however, is that she may have committed a major mistake: she sent Binay a message that is against Binay.

I guess thats why my sources told me that the Binays never hired her.

If I were a Binay and after seeing that, why the hell would I? VP Binay, good call!


Akbayan Party-list
I think that you, the reader, have come up with your own conclusions about this issue based on what youre read in this article. However, let me raise some points that you may have missed out on.

Two factions, Balay and Samar, dominated politics inside the Aquino-era Malacaang.

In as far as presidentiables, Roxas headed the Balay Faction while Binay headed Samar. At the time, Roxas presidential hopes were in danger because VP Binays was consistently outperforming him in popularity surveys.

Evidence suggests that Roxas Usec. Tom Villarin was Joyce Ramirezs contact, i.e. the one who calls the shots in as far as the two black propaganda campaigns are concerned. Villarin, along with the pretty much the rest of Akbayan Partylist, was affiliated with the Balay Faction, i.e. it is in Villarins interest to make Roxas win in 2016.

Given available data, it is entirely possible that Villarin and Akbayan launched the aforementioned black propaganda campaign without Roxas consent. On the flip side, however, Villarin is pretty much Roxas right-hand man in those days, so its quite hard to believe that Roxas knew nothing of the operations.

After all, have all SM employees personally met Henry Sy?

Evidence clearly suggests that that Akbayan Partylist  where Senator Risa Hontiveros belongs  is into black propaganda. Surely, Villarin would not have acted on his own because such a massive black ops requires thorough coordination and funding.

But I guess they fell short on funding because Ramirez was pissed.

Regardless, I think this adds new color to the recent fake news controversy involving the seven-or-so EU parliamentarians whose photos were splashed on national broadsheets. One of the persons in the picture is actually not even European: its Tom Villarin.

The brown guy is Tom Villarin.
A gentle warning to current and former clients
As promised in the disclaimers, I took every step to ensure that none of Ramirezs post-Roxas clients will get entangled in this article, for the simple reason that they may not have been aware of Ramirezs proclivities.

You are politicians. You need publicity to survive. I understand that perfectly. Besides, I do not like burning bridges unnecessarily.

Note, however, that based on the data provided above, its best for you to find ways to ensure that Ramirez will not do to you the same thing she did to Roxas.

I know all of you, and I think that all of you, despite your respective flaws, have the potential to change this country for the better. Dont let Ramirez take that opportunity away from you.

With that said, I think I now understand why oppositionists like Pinoy Ako Blog accuse me of being a paid hack, because it seems that most political content creators in the past were on the payroll of some PR operator, so they thought Im cut from the same cloth.

Im sorry to disappoint you, but the best thing I got from any politician is free food.

But of course, I do not speak for the other bloggers, like those who pulled the Poe-Cayetano 2022 issue out of their own @$$. Who knows, would it be outlandish to suspect that they're on Ramirez's payroll too!?

Anyway, let me finish this article with this piece of advice for Miss Ramirez:
Joyce, you need a career shift. Mag-TESDA ka na!

"#CocoyGate: Cocoy's Missing? Hey NBI Cybercrime, heres another name","THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN IN COLLABORATION WITH SASS ROGANDO SASOT. FEATURE IMAGE CREDITS GO TO VINCIT OMNIA VERITAS PHILIPPINES (VOVPH).


Its been several days since I published #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, heres the guy youre looking for. In that article, I explained that a certain Edward Angelo Cocoy Dayao, who claims to be a former PCOO consultant in his own LinkedIn profile, is deeply connected to the fake news website SilentNoMorePh.com that libeled the seven senators not too long ago.

To shed light on the matter, the senate invited Dayao and I to the 04 October 2017 senate hearing on fake news. A senate source informed me the day before that Dayao will be attending, but I was sorely disappointed after discovering that he was a no-show. And as expected, it was I who was put on the hot seat, as oppositionist Liberal Party senators grilled me one after another, as if I was the accused and not Dayao.

And you know what happened then.

But is Cocoy the only possible suspect?


Note: Please forgive me for typos. I don't have an editor and I'm really tired right now. 
#NasaanSiCocoy (#WhereIsCocoy)
Senate Public Information Committee chair Senator Grace Poe said she wouldve wished to conclude the hearings right then and there, but she instead decided to suspend it because Cocoy Dayao has to be found and interrogated first. After all, Cocoy Dayaos the central figure in this issue and no one else.

Because of his non-appearance despite the senates invitation, the Senate has subpoenaed Cocoy Dayao to force him to appear in the next hearing.

Three days after that fateful Wednesday hearing, I asked my senate sources if theres any progress towards finding Cocoy, and they told me that they havent found a trace. Flight is a sign of guilt, but whatever.

Cocoy is missing, and thats a problem.

What we know so far
Suffice it to say, Dayao is key to solving the mystery, and that key is MISSING. If Dayao somehow pops up from nowhere in the near future, then alls well. But if he doesnt, then the quest of the seven senators for whos behind the Seven Deadly Sens campaign will grind to a halt.

Now, the problem with the first #CocoyGate article is that Sass, VovPH, and I found only ONE person connected with SilentNoMore, and that is Cocoy Dayao.
A succeeding article, #CocoyGate: Senator Villar, let me link Cocoy to Bam and Kiko, cites another name  Nia Terol-Zialcita  as another potential suspect, but aside from Terol-Zialcitas involved in ProPinoy as its Deputy editor-in-chief and co-founder, there is no evidence showing that she has any significant web development skills, so for now, Im willing to set her aside.

In short, if Dayao remains missing, then were at a dead end. And in times like these, what I typically do is sit in a corner, go back to basics, and retrace the steps.

So lets do that.

Back to Basics
First, the kerfuffle in the Senate started from the seven senators complaint about SilentNoMorePHs 26 September 2017 post accompanied by an article entitled Malacanang Dogs in the Senate: Pimentel, Sotto, Gordon, Villar, Zubiri, Honasan, Pacquiao. It was then followed by another blog post entitled Labanan ang #7DeadlySens!!!, a pun on the 7 Deadly Sins.

Second, we know from #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, heres the guy youre looking for that:
Google advertisements served in SilentNoMorePH, ProPinoy, Madam Claudia, ThinkingMillenials, PulisPatola, BackroomPolitics, and WeSupportBamAquino originate from the same Google Adsense Account with publisher ID pub-8283971809912134.
Cocoy Dayao is a founder and Editor-in-chief of one ProPinoy.
A single Google Adsense Publisher ID (pub-1068157602481996) also owns or controls over 20 other sites, including, but not necessarily limited to, ChangeScamming, BackroomPolitics, Politikang Ina Mo, and Pinoy Ako Blog.
Cocoy Dayao is the registered administrator contact of Pinoy Ako Blog.
Its clear, at this point, that the collective wrath of the seven senators is focused on SilentNoMorePH.

But is it just SilentNoMore?


Pinoy Ako Blog
In Labanan ang #7DeadlySens!!!, SilentNoMorePH paired each senator to a specific deadly sin, though it wasnt specific as to which is paired to what. As if taking a cue from SilentNoMorePH, Pinoy Ako Blog expanded SilentNoMorePHs the #7DeadlySens post by providing more libelous specificity.
Published a day after SilentNoMorePHs post, Pinoy Ako Blogs The Unfortunate Seven states:
Ito ang mga senador na ayaw matigil ang pagpatay sa mga menor de edad na Pilipino. Iboboto mo pa ba sila? (These are the senators who do not want a stop to the killing of Filipino minors. Will you still vote for them?)""
Pinoy Ako Blog then showed a series of infographics that paired each senator with a specific deadly sin:
Lust for Senator Sotto, calling him a rapist, plagiarist, and bigot. 
Gluttony for Senator Villar, saying shes galit sa extra rice.
Greed for Senator Pacquiao, calling him a tax evader, a womanizer, and a former drug addict.
Sloth for Senator Pimentel, saying he lacks balls and a disappointment to his father.
Wrath for Senator Honasan, accusing him of stealing P30 million in pork barrel funds
Envy for Senator Zubiri, accusing him of electoral cheating. 
Pride for Senator Gordon, calling him a perpetual political butterfly and for whitewashing the Matobato-Lascaas senate investigations.
Now, why is this important?

SNM and PAB
The Senators are fuming at SilentNoMorePH, but they should be angrier at PinoyAkoBlog, for the simple reason that the latter did more damage to their reputation. And dont forget that both are owned or controlled by the same Cocoy Dayao. That is, its likely that those behind PAB are also behind SilentNoMorePH.

But how exactly did PAB do more damage?
Engagement per post (EPP) is a social media analytics metric that measures a posts interestingness to an audience. That is, higher EPP scores means a post spreads to more people [TP:Mainstream vs Indie].
EPP is defined by the following formula:
Engagement per Post = Engagement  Number of Posts
A look at Facebook Page Insights data taken at 1713 hrs, 08 October 2017, shows that while SilentNoMore has higher absolute engagement figures compared to Pinoy Ako Blog, the latter posted only a small fraction of what the former did.

Facebook Page Insights data taken at 1713 hrs, 08 October 2017
From the data in the image and using the EPP formula, EPP for SilentNoMorePH is 1,270 while that for PinoyAkoBlog is 4,911. That is, PinoyAkoBlogs libelous posts may have done about 3 times more damage to the seven senators reputation, compared to SilentNoMorePHs posts.

And just like SilentNoMorePH, Cocoy Dayao owns or controls PinoyAkoBlog.

I have a reasonable suspicion that SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog, owing to their similar content and talking points, and common webmasters, and possibly, a common financial beneficiary.

Now, recall that I myself said in during the #CocoyGate #SenateHearing that Cocoy, who has web development skills, may be working with a bunch of content creators because of the sheer number of sites that Cocoy controls.

So, lets ask:
Who are the content creators behind SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog?
Who are Cocoys Content Creators?
Of course, the content creators are anonymous, but theres an easy way to find a few clues.

You see, SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog both run on WordPress, which is probably the most popular content management system for websites on earth. And because WordPress is popular, a lot of people know how it works.

Now, adding the character string /wp-json/wp/v2/users to a WordPress-powered blogs web address reveals the login IDs of the sites users. Thus, lets try checking the following:

Silentnomoreph.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users
Pinoyakoblog.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users

For SilentNoMorePH, heres a video showing how I did it:

And for PinoyAkoBlog:


Let me list down the information I got.

For SilentNoMorePH, four users showed up. These are:
User Admin, with display name Charlie
User Vic, with display name Vic
User JD, with display name JD
User Maria, with display name Maria
For PinoyAkoBlog, five users showed up. These are:
User Admin-2, with display name admin
User Kit, with display name Full Retard
User Admin, with display name Mr. Pinoy
User Jover, with display name Mr. Pinoy
User Apple, with display name Mr. Pinoy
And heres where things get interesting.


Who are these people?
It is common for internet users to use their nickname for their online login IDs, and I suspect that at least one among those login IDs I found is a real nickname (or even the real first name) of the corresponding user.

Now, the nicknames Vic, Maria, JD, Charlie, Apple, and Kit are too generic, so I admit that my online forensic skills are not enough to find out who they are. However, the last remaining username, Jover, is interesting.

I think I can do something with it because Jover is a relatively rare first name.
A simple google search using the search term Jover PinoyAkoBlog [A] shows a certain Jover Laurio diligently sharing PinoyAkoBlogs posts on a public Facebook group NETIZENS FOR CONSCIENCE AND BRAVERY (NetCAB)



Its interesting to note that Edwin Lacierda is also a NetCAB member.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
Laurio may delete her posts (and even her account) as soon as she finds out about this article, so I archived the pertinent pages using the third-party service Archive.is. That is, every hyperlink with the text [A] links to the archived snapshot of the hyperlinked page immediately preceding it.
For example, for the sentence ThinkingPinoy wrote this article [A]., the page linked to [A] is an archived copy of the page linking to ThinkingPinoy.

Enough with that. On with the analysis.

Now its time check her NetCAB posts. Note that each of the following several images contain two screenshots: one when the mouse pointer hovers over Laurios post share timestamp, and another with mouse hovering over PinoyAkoBlogs post timestamp.

Lets tabulate the time differences between PinoyAkoBlogs posts and Laurios shares:

Post No. 1: ~3 minutes
Post No. 2: ~1 minute
Post No. 3: ~2 minutes
Post No. 4: ~2 minutes
Post No. 5: ~1 minute
Post No. 6: ~6 minutes


Here are some of Jovers other shares:

10  Walang Katapusang Kapalpakan ni Andanar  Time Difference: 1 minute
11  May Traydor sa Bayan | Pinoy Ako Blog  Time Difference: 6 minutes

As we can see, Laurios shared PinoyAkoBlogs posts almost immediately after the latter posted them on Facebook. Now, is Jover just a rabid PinoyAkoBlog fan, or is she one of PinoyAkoBlogs administrators?

At this point, its too early to tell. But we are not done yet. Lets take a look at Jovers tweets.

Jover Laurios Tweets
Jover goes by the twitter handle MissJover [A].

Now, lets check some of her latest retweets of PinoyAkoBlogs tweets.


1: 05.Oct.2017 | Retweet Timestamp: 3:09 PM | PAB Tweet Timestamp: 3:07 PM

Lets tabulate the time differences between PinoyAkoBlogs tweets and Laurios retweets:

Tweet No. 1: ~2 minutes
Tweet No. 2: ~2 minutes
Tweet No. 3: ~2 minutes
Tweet No. 4: ~15 minutes
Tweet No. 5: ~2 minute

Again, as we can see, Laurio retweeted PinoyAkoBlogs tweets almost immediately after PAB tweets. And again, is Jover just a rabid fan, or is she one of PinoyAkoBlogs administrators?

Seriously, Laurio's devotion to PinoyAkoBlog is tenacious, to say the least.


The Laurio-Dayao Connection
Looking further into Laurios tweets, Sass and I discovered that Laurio has been in contact with Dayao from way back, as evidenced by a 28 December 2015 tweet where Laurio basically pep talked Dayao, as shown below [A]:

Four months later on 04 April 2016, Laurio pep talked Dayao again, as show below [A]:


Interestingly, on 17 Jun 2016, or around the time Laurio was sharing PinoyAkoBlogs posts on Facebook, Laurio even relayed Dayaos web development advice to blogger Raissa Robles [A].


On 26 February 2016, one of Laurios lawyer-friends [A] gave her a brand new 64 GB Ipad Air. Shes so thankful for it that, in reply to Dayaos congratulatory tweet, she even said:
Thanks Coy! I feel so blessed! Ang mahal kaya nito, alam ni God na di ko kayang bumili on my own

I think the previous exchanges are sufficient to show that Dayao and Laurio know each other better than simple online acquaintances. Dayao even uses Laurio's content for his facebook posts, as shown in a cached copy of Dayao's Facebook Note entitled ""Warning: The next social media account Team Duterte steals could be yours"", with a backlink to Laurio's Twitter account.

Yeah, they follow each other. They know each other well.

TPs Takeaways
Let me sum this whole thing up.

First, lets list down what we have discovered:

While SilentNoMorePH is the focus of the #SenateHearing, it has to be pointed out that PinoyAkoBlog did more damage to the seven senators respective reputations.
SilentNoMorePH and PinoyAkoBlog share the same web administrator, and thats Cocoy Dayao.
SilentNoMorePHs and PinoyAkoBlogs respective libelous articles about the Senate Resolution 516 scandal share the same talking points.
PinoyAkoBlogs users include a certain person going by the username Jover.
A little more sleuthing shows that Laurio shares and retweets PinoyAkoBlogs posts almost immediate after PinoyAkoBlogs administrators post them on Facebook or tweets them.
Laurio knows Dayao, and their exchanges can be traced as far back sa December 2015.
Judging by the quality of their exchanges, Laurio and Cocoy seem to be pretty emotionally close.
Laurio even gets web development advice from Dayao.

Now, let me ask this one simple question:
How many persons with the first name Jover will you ever meet in your life?
More specifically:
How many Jovers can Cocoy possibly know personally?
Oh, before I forget: PinoyAkoBlog previously said Sass is an idiot because PAB's blogger is female.

Sounds just about right.

The preponderance of evidence suggests that NBI Cybercrime should contact Jover Laurio and ask her more than a few questions. Luckily, she published her entire name online on 28 February 2017 [A].



Her complete name is MARIA JOSEPHINA VERGINIA NATURAL LAURIO.


NBI Cybercrime, if you cant find Cocoy, find her. 



Oh, and by the way, she studies at Lyceum Law",RJ Nieto,"October 8, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/10/cocoygate-finding-cocoy-missing-nbi.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#CocoyGate: Senator Villar, let me link Cocoy to Bam and Kiko","Senator Cynthia Villar, I think I'm on to something.


In last weeks #CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, heres the guy youre looking for, I explained how several opposition-aligned websites share a common webmaster: Edward Angelo Cocoy Dayao, practically uncovering a massive anti-administration propaganda machine.

In that article, I looked into the Google Adsense advertisements served in these sites and compared them to the advertisements served in websites known to be owned or controlled by Dayao.

That is, I showed that Dayaos Propinoy.net uses the same Google Adsense Account as SilentNoMorePH, MadamClaudiaAko among others.
Moreover, I showed that Dayaos PinoyAkoBlog uses the same Google Adsense Account as ChangeScamming, BackroomPolitics among other.

And now, what?
Defending Cocoy
As the article went viral, several opposition bloggers have come to the rescue, arguing that Dayao is just a domain reseller who has nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of these websites.

But I beg to disagree.

Domain resellers do not inject their own advertisement codes in the domains that they sell. Moreover, the fact that Dayao earns money from those websites on a continuous basis is sufficient proof of Dayaos complicity in their operations.

Besides, why would a website owner let go of website revenue, no matter how small? Adsense can be set up to do automatic bank deposits, so why would a website owner ignore such a revenue stream that basically doesnt require a lot of maintenance?

Moreover, for the sake of argument, isnt it too coincidental that all of these sites were sourced from the same person?

Assuming for the sake of argument that the anti-administration websites are operated by independent entitites, its likely the somebody must have referred those entities to Dayao.
Well, Dayao owns the single-proprietorship IT consulting company Lab Rats Technica [SHC] and according to Lab Rats website, Cocoy created the website for the Office of Senator Kiko Pangilinan [LabRats].

But is that the only connection? Sounds pretty thin to me.

And that, my friends, is what Ill explore further in this post.

The ProPinoy Connection
I myself do not believe that Cocoy generates content for all these sites on his own: theres so many, its humanly impossible. Thus, I felt that the next logical step is to do some online sleuthing to check for other potential conspirators, i.e. other potential suspects.

The first clue came when I stumbled upon a 21 May 2013 post in Senator Bam Aquinos official facebook page, which features a photo showing Bam shaking hands with a jeepney driver and with the accompanying caption:

Whats interesting to note here is how Aquino ran a well-rounded campaign. He worked on the ground, and he worked online and offline to deliver the message ~Cocoy Dayao

Following the Dayao quote that Aquino used is a backlink to one of Dayaos ProPinoy articles, as shown below:



Now, the photo in itself is insufficient proof, but it does raise reasonable suspicion, so I dug even deeper, and I found an interesting connection.
Recall that that the infamous SilentNoMorePH and ProPinoy share the same webmaster, Cocoy Dayao, and that Dayao calls himself the chairman and editor-in-chief of ProPinoy.

Interestingly, ProPinoy was co-founded by Cocoy Dayao and a certain Nia Terol.


Let me repeat: we have shown in last weeks article that whoever is behind ProPinoy is also behind SilentNoMorePH and so far, we know that Cocoy is its chairman and editor-in-chief.

Now, according to her CNN author bio, Terol is a co-founder of deputy editor of Pro-Pinoy [CNN]. More specifically, according to her personal blog, she is the President and Deputy Editor of ProPinoy [Terol].

Who is Nia Terol?
But wait, theres more! I checked Nia Terols [LinkedIn Account] and if Terol somehow decides to take it down, you can find a saved PDF printout by clicking here.

ProPinoy co-founder Nia Terol

Looking at Terols past jobs per her LinkedIn profile, we see that she was:

1: New Media Bureau Head
2010 Liberal Party Senatorial Campaign 
Current LP senators who also ran for senator in 2010 are Risa Hontiveros and Franklin Drilon. It's also interesting to note that embattled Comelec chair Andy Bautista's brother Martin also ran under LP's 2010 ticket.

2: Executive Director
Pipol Power Institute 
A nonprofit that is dedicated to the full realization of People Power in the national life and in the international arena [PPI FB]. Sitting as Chairman is Jim Paredes.

3: Communications Head
Senatorial Campaign of Bam Aquino (2012-2013) 
Terol said she heads overall communications and new media operations for the senatorial campaign of Benigno Bam Aquino of the Liberal Party of the Philippines. Manages messaging and issues management, news media and digital operations.

4: Political Communications/New Media Head
Office of Senator Kiko Pangilinan (2009-2013)
Terol said her high-level tasks include communications planning and execution, messaging and branding, networking, (and) liaising, among others.

5: Communications and Messaging Head
Office of Senator Bam Aquino (2013-2014)
She headed overall communications, messaging, and digital operations.

6. Writer, Editor and Project Manager, 
TAYO Magazine of the TAYO Awards Foundation
Bam Aquino was president of TAYO Foundation from 2009 to 2013 [Senate]. Today, the Office of Sen. Bam Aquino still partners with TAYO foundation [TAYO].

I don't know but isn't the link too obvious? It was practically LP, especially Bam and Kiko, who built her career. She worked as Kiko's New Media (READ: Social Media) head for FOUR YEARS for crying out loud!


TPs Takeaways
Terol, with Dayao, co-founded ProPinoy.net, the sister website of SilentNoMorePH and Madam Claudia and so far, this is how I see it:

I have shown in the previous article that Dayao has sufficient technical know-how to set up the websites, but he doesn't have the communication skills to complete the formula... ...and Terol, Dayao's close associate, can provide that.
But Terol is not just any other social media marketing specialist. She is someone whose skills were honed during her lengthy stint as a ""New Media Head"" for Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan and the rest of the Liberal Party.


Should Sen. Sotto also ask NBI Cybercrime Division to investigate Terol?

Yes, he should. ASAP.

There are still a lot of questions that must be answered to uncover this whole mess but one thing's for sure: Cocoy Dayao is one crappy web security consultant.",RJ Nieto,"October 2, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/10/cocoygate-senator-villar-let-me-link.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#CocoyGate: Senator Sotto, here's the guy you're looking for","THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN IN COLLABORATION WITH  VOVPH AND SASS ROGANDO SASOT.

Since the start of the Duterte Presidency, the opposition and their numerous allies in mainstream media have demonized Duterte-aligned social media personalities, accusing us of being part of some well-oiled, large-scale propaganda machine, an allegation that they have so far failed to substantiate.

Leading the pack is Rappler CEO Maria Ressa, and her best evidence against us is some testimony from a single anonymous source, which I find utterly pathetic. And all the while, they have been turning a blind eye on anti-government, Liberal Party-aligned pages such as Madam Claudia, SilentNoMorePH, ChangeScamming, and the relatively new Pinoy Ako Blog.

So just like what my friend Sass Rogando Sasot and I have been doing since god-knows-when, let us do what mainstream media wilfully neglects to do: investigate these pages and see if theres a puppeteer behind them.

Note that I am not against anonymous blogs, as I was once the most notorious anonymous blogger in the Philippines. However, I made sure that I did not break laws with whatever I write, something that the anonymous blog SilentNoMore PH cares little about.

I wanted to be anonymous because I do not want fame. However, some appear to stay anonymous, not to evade the limelight, but to evade accountability.

SilentNoMore versus the Senate
A few days ago, SilentNoMore PH called majority bloc senators Malacanang Dogs for not signing the Senate Resolution calling for an investigation on alleged extrajudicial killings in the country [TV5].

The senators named by SilentNoMorePH are:
Sen. Vicente Tito Sotto
Sen. Aquilino Koko Pimentel
Sen. Cynthia Villar
Sen. Richard Gordon
Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri
Sen. Emmanuel Manny Pacquiao
Sen. Gregorio Gringo Honasan
Referring to these seven senators, SilentNoMore PH said:
Their loyalty is to the palace, not to Filipino people whose votes gave them mandate to begin with These senators votes are reflective of their stance: They dont care about lives. They dont want to hold this government accountable. They only care about their alliance with Malacanang These are the senators who will block any action that would investigate the sins of the government. These are the senators whose silence lead(s) to continuous murder of poor and innocent children
The problem? These seven senators were not even notified that there was such a senate resolution to begin with. That is, they cannot possibly say no to a question that was never asked to them in the first place.

All seven senators are visibly incensed over SilentNoMore PHs irresponsible post, with Senator Sotto even planning to file cyber libel cases against those behind the social media entity.

But theres a problem: Who are behind Silent No More PH?

And thats what Ill try to answer, and more.
Silent No More PH 
Site URL: http://silentnomoreph.com/ 
Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/silentnomorePH
Domain Privacy
In April 2016, I published #BangkoSerye: Sonny Trillanes and his Hacker-Friend, where I successfully uncovered self-proclaimed hacker and Magdalo member Bem Pontejos as the administrator behind EllenTordesillas.com.

I did that using a simple WhoIs lookup, which basically shows the contact information of a websites registrant, administrator, and tech contacts.

WhoIs lookups, however, do not always work because of domain privacy services, or paid services that allow website owners to hide their identity by using third-party contact information in lieu of their own. In the BangkoSerye issue, Bem Pontejos immediately subscribed to domain privacy services from WHOISGUARD to hide his details, even if it was already late.

Unfortunately, SilentNoMore PH also has domain privacy protection, with its registrant, admin, and tech contacts showing as Contact Privacy Inc., which is obviously a domain privacy services provider.

Hence, WhoIs wont be very useful in unmasking SilentNoMore PH (SNM PH).

But wait, theres more!

Google AdSense
Serving Google Adsense advertisements, such as the one seen below, is the most popular way to earn money from a website. SNM PHs website silentnomore.ph has such advertisements.
So lets ask: whos earning money from SNMs website?

The funny thing about Google Ads is that Google requires site administrators to verify their identity and physical addresses before they are even allowed to insert ads in their websites.

Google verifies addresses by sending snail mail containing a passcode to administrators. Upon receiving the letter, the administrators use these passcodes to activate their respective accounts. This makes the process very tedious for residents of countries like the Philippines since the letters are usually mailed from the United States. For example, it took me three months before I received my Google Adsense letter, and only then was I able to serve ads on ThinkingPinoy.net.

Thus, its not impossible for ads served on SNMs website to originate from a Adsense account thats also used by other websites.

Now, Google Adsense source codes, when inserted into a web page, show the ads Google AdSense Publisher ID. The Google Adsense Publisher ID is a unique numeric identifier for a Google AdSense Account. Thus, knowing whos behind SNM is just a matter of getting the Publisher ID in SNMs ads and comparing it to the publisher IDs of sites whose owners are already known.

Why? Because its the owner of the AdSense Account who financially benefits from all the Google ads served using that account, regardless of what website those ads are served. Surely, no moron will allow others to steal earnings from his own website.

If I were a website owner, why would I let my sites ad earnings go to somebody else?


SilentNoMorePH
SNM PHs desktop version has an advertisement field at the top of the home page and we can get the Google Adsense Publisher ID through the following steps:
Open Google Chrome. 
Right-click on the ad 
Choose Inspect from the drop-down menu 
Press CTRL+F (find tool), type ca-pub, and press enter. 
After performing these steps, you will see something similar to the following image:

The number immediately succeeding ca-pub, which is pub-8283971809912134, is the Google AdSense publisher ID of whoever owns or controls SilentNoMorePH.

At this point, the question would be So what other sites serve ads with the same publisher ID?

Sister Sites!
With the publisher ID already known, its now just a matter of finding other websites whose administrators are already known and whose Google Ads feature the same publisher ID.

Using the same process of finding publisher IDs, we found out that the ads served on ProPinoy.net also feature the same publisher ID pub-8283971809912134, as shown below.


ProPinoy 
Site URL: https://propinoy.net/ 
Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/ProPinoy.net

But it doesnt end there.
Madam Claudias site ads also use the the publisher ID pub-8283971809912134, as shown below.


Madam Claudia
Site URL: https://madamclaudiaako.com/Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/MadamClaudiaOfficialPage/
In short, Cocoy Dayao, the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of ProPinoy.net, also owns or controls the websites of SilentNoMore PH and Madam Claudia, websites whose content are shared in their respective Facebook Pages.


There are also three other sites that share the same publisher ID pub-8283971809912134, as shown below:

These sites are:

1: WeSupportBamAquino.com - pro-Bam website that attacks critics of Bam Aquino.

INTERESTING. DOES BAM AQUINO HAVE A HAND IN ALL THESE?

2: ThinkingMillenialsPH.com - a site that focuses on attacking pro-Duterte bloggers, all are anti-Duterte posts.

3: PulisPatola.com - a fake news site that focuses on attacks against the credibility of the police force.

Were already here anyway, so we might as well check other anonymous websites and see if theyre also owned or controlled by Cocoy Dayao.

Cocoy controls even more anonymous sites
I also checked the publisher ID used in the ads served in the following sites:

ChangeScamming
Site URL: https://changescamming.net/ 
Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/NaDuterte/ 

Backroom Politics 
Site URL: https://backroompolitics.net/ 
Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/backroompolitics 

Pinoy Ako Blog 
Site URL: https://pinoyakoblog.com/ 
Facebook URL: https://www.facebook.com/pinoyakoblog/
As it turns out, all three sites use the Google Adsense Publisher ID pub-1068157602481996. Below is a screen recording showing how I extracted the publisher IDs of all six sites:
Now, Sass Rogando Sasot has earlier shown that Cocoy Dayao is the administrator contact of Pinoy Ako Blog (PAB), which PAB later acknowledged in a blog post [PAB], though PAB claims that Dayao is just a webmaster (administrator) and not the actual content creator behind PAB.

Regardless, whats clear here is that Cocoy Dayao is the administrator not only of PAB, but also of Backroom Politics and ChangeScamming. If Dayao sees nothing wrong in being a potential accessory to a crime, then thats his problem, not ours.

But wait... theres more, a lot more!

It appears that Cocoy Dayao owns or controls six sites so far, but a more comprehensive search shows that Dayao owns or controls many other fake news sites.

Leveling-up the Research
Using a paid TCPIPUtils.com subscription, I checked for sites using the two Google Adsense Publisher IDs linked to Dayao. TCPIPUtils is a freemium service, or a service that can be used for free, but whose features are limited unless a user has a paid subscription.

First and just for kicks, I did a reverse Adsense lookup on my own Google Adsense Publisher ID pub-2492942939032867 and it shows only two sites:ThinkingPinoy.com and ThinkingPinoy.net, domains that I actually own, as shown below:

Second, I did the same on the ID pub-8283971809912134, as shown below:

Aside from ProPinoy, Madam Claudia, and Silent No More, three other websites with one being twentyeightfourteen.com, where the [about page] is a writeup about Cocoy Dayao, suggesting that Dayao owns or controls this site.

Third and most interestingly, I did a reverse Adsense lookup on pub-1068157602481996, as shown below:

Aside from PinoyAkoBlog, ChangeScamming, and BackroomPolitics, Dayao also owns or controls the other smaller news or opinion sites such as:
anunabes.com - a supposedly hip news site whose associated facebook page didnt pick up steam and thus was apparently abandoned.
dikukurap.com - a fake news site that calls Duterte supporters Duterte D*ck Suckers
dotreport.org - an seemingly abandoned and generally oppositionist opinion blog.
duterteadminnews.com - an apparently pro-Duterte site but its Facebook page got only 92 likes, suggesting that whatever Cocoys plans here were abandoned. There are only 4 posts.
fightfortruth.club - supposedly a fact checking site, although it focuses only on fact checking obviously fake news sites using a clear anti-administration bias. Updated once a week.
FixPH.org - another fake news site that called Senator Gordon a d*ck as it accused the senator of conniving with Sen. Pimentel in a power grabe against Sen. De Lima.
kolektibo.com - a seemingly abandoned pro-Duterte site.
PilipinongPalaban.com - a staunchly pro-Leni site. No traction though.
politikanginamo.com - another fake news site. According to one of its more recent articles, Wapakels (si Duterte) kung bata man o matanda, buntis o may kapansanan, inosente man o hindi. Basta sabihin ng mga DDS army na adik ka, patay ka!
 SocialPatrol.ph - an Liberal Party-leaning website where one of the articles even talks about The Lighter Side of the Senator Trillanes AMA on Reddit

Yeah, thats a lot, and I am only talking about those websites that I was able to find.

How many more does Cocoy Dayao own or control?

What to do with Cocoy Dayao
Dayao, in his LinkedIn and [UpWork] profiles, calls himself the Chief Technical Officer of a certain Lab Rats Technica Digital Consulting, a Lipa-based single-proprietorship IT services firm and at this point, it is clear that Cocoy Dayao is involved in these sites in a significant capacity.

We still have to verify if he himself creates some or all of the content for these sites, or if he has associates who help him with it. However, I am inclined to believe the latter because the sheer number of these websites and their varying tones of writing suggest an organization behind the effort as opposed to just one martyr.

Does Dayao do this for love of country, or does he have other motivations? According to his linkedin account, he was a PCOO consultant from 2012 until PNoy stepped down in June 2016. Besides, he does web programming and development for a living.

Dayao is not that smart, as evidenced by his monumental carelessness that led to the creation of this article. Thus, its not unlikely that theres someone behind him whos calling the shots, whos providing the funds.

Being the administrator of several fake news sites, Dayao should be invited to the October 4th Senate Hearing on Fake News so the Senate can find out who the brains and the money behind this Liberal Party Propaganda Machine.

Who knows, this might actually be the well-oiled, well-funded propaganda machinery that Maria Ressa has been talking about?

Has Ressa been barking up the wrong tree the entire time?

At the rate things are going, apparently so.",RJ Nieto,"September 29, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/09/cocoygate-senator-sotto-heres-guy-youre.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
CHR as legal fiction and the removal of Chito Gascon,"I have read some posts questioning the legal existence of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, with the argument being that there is no enabling law creating CHR. That is, while the Constitution provides for the creation of a CHR, the current CHR is created only by virtue of an executive order, which is EO 163 s. 1987.

EO 163, which was issued in May 1987, or three months after the 1987 was ratified. This date of issuance is important in light of the 1987 Constitutions Transitory Provisions.

Specifically, Art. XVII Sec. 6 of the 1987 Constitution states:
""The incumbent President shall continue to exercise legislative powers until the first Congress is convened.""
EO 163 s. 1987, which was issued way before the First post-EDSA Congress convened. That is, despite being just an EO, EO 163 has the force and effect of a Republic Act because Cory had ersatz dictatorial powers right after EDSA and right before Congress convened. The First post-EDSA congress convened in July 1987, about two months after Cory Aquino issued EO 163.

In short, EO 163 sufficiently provides legal existence for CHR so no, CHR's legal existence is not in question. 

This bears repeating: THE CHR IS NOT LEGAL FICTION.

But wait, there's more.

Why bother asking?
Truth be told, a lot of Filipinos arent very happy with the CHR of late, and many are calling for its abolition mainly due to its disturbing politicization.

For example, former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chair Chito Gascon has been travelling all over world denouncing allegedly Duterte-sanctioned human rights violations, despite the fact that  there is no concrete evidence that the HR violations are indeed sanctioned by the palace and  it is not within the CHRs mandate to go overseas and disparage the government.
I think, however, that the Commission on Human Rights should not be abolished because the issue here is less on the legitimacy of CHRs real purpose and more on doubts surrounding Chairman Gascons real motives.

The House of Representatives share the same opinion, in my belief. After appropriating a measly P1,000 annual budget for CHR, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez said he may reconsider this if Gascon resigns [GT].

But of course, Gascon will NOT resign. Let me tell you why, then let me tell you what we can do about it.

Why Gascon will not resign
If Gascon resigns, LP will lose its best propaganda tool.

The continued existence of a political party depends on its ability to project political relevance, and this is possible mainly through having party members occupy influential positions in government, positions that they can use for propaganda. That is, the continued existence of a political party is concomitant to its access to propaganda tools.
Unfortunately for Gascons Liberal Party, its members occupy only six key avenues of power, and these are:
The Vice-presidency, via LP Chairperson Leni Robredo,
The Senate, via the 5 LP stalwarts senators,
The Ombudsman, via Aquino-appointee Conchita Morales, and
The Commission on Elections, via Aquino-appointee Andres Bautista
The Supreme Court, via Aquino appointee Maria Lourdes Sereno.
The CHR, via former LP director-general and Aquino-appointee Jose Luis Chito Gascon.
Now, lets discuss the effectiveness of each.

LPs Propaganda Tools
FIRST, VP Leni Robredo tried to disparage the Duterte Administration, but she has neither the widespread charisma nor the intellectual aptitude so shes largely ignored. Case in point, her popularity ratings continue to dip, with her net approval rating rivalling that of former VP Binay at his lowest point.

SECOND, LP is also losing steam in the Senate. Its primary attack dog Trillanes is toast. Its next attack dog, Senator Leila de Lima, is in detention for letting her primordial itch pave the way for the drug menace. Its third attack dog, Kidnapper-Senator Risa Hontiveros, has become the nations laughing stock after gloriously bungling several times, and is at immediate risk of being perpetually disqualified from public office for wiretapping Justice Secretary Aguirre.

Thus, we are left with Senators Aquino, Pangilinan, and Drilon. Note that the other two LP senators Villanueva and Recto are already members of the Senate majority bloc so I wouldnt consider them part of LPs propaganda arsenal.

LP Senators from left: De Lima, Aquino, Pangilinan, Drilon, and Hontiveros. Trillanes is from the Nacionalista Party but he has no party loyalty, and serves as LP's attack dog in the Senate.
Now, Drilon and Pangilinan are LP stalwarts, but theyre political chameleons. While they would defend LP, they simply are not the kind of people who would stick their neck out for their party.
Aquino, on the other hand, appears to have presidential ambitions, and if he has been intently watching Leni Robredo, he must have realized that attacking the massively popular administration will obliterate his political future.
THIRD, the Ombudsman in itself is not a very powerful propaganda tool because it needs to work alongside other officials to pin someone down. And even if it were, Ombudsman Morales will step down in July 2018, so her days in power will be over 10 months from now.

FOURTH, Comelec isnt a very powerful propaganda tool either. Its relevant only during the election season. Moreover, the embattled Bautistas hold on power is already questionable, as fellow Comelec commissioners called for his resignation amidst the Andy-Tisha scandal.


FIFTH, the Chief Justice isnt a very powerful propaganda tool, as CJs typically inhibit from speaking publicly and lets be honest: only a handful of Filipinos actually spend time reading her court decisions.

Thus, we have only one avenue left: The Commission on Human Rights.

Thus, If Gascon resigns, LP will lose the single most effective propaganda tool in its arsenal. So yes, Gason will not resign. But then, is resignation the only way to kick Gascon out?

Removing Chito Gascon
Some camps argue that Chito Gascon can only be removed through impeachment. But it seems that very question whether Gascon is an impeachable official or not, so lets ask:
Is the CHR chairman an impeachable official?
The 1987 Constitution clearly lists down the types of impeachable officials. Specifically, Art. XI Sec. 2 lists impeachable officials as:
The President
The Vice-president
The members of the Supreme Court
The members of the Constitutional Commissions, and 
The Ombudsman.
Thus, Gascon is an impeachable official if hes a member of a constitutional commission. Thus, lets ask:
Is the CHR is a constitutional commission?
At first glance, it appears that the CHR indeed is a constitutional commission, as an entire article in the Constitution is dedicated to its creation. However, Article IX, explicitly entitled Constitutional Commission, does NOT include the CHR in its list of constitutional commissions.

Specifically, Art. IX (A) Sec. 1 states:
The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be independent, are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit.
Yes, theres no CHR in the list.

Some camps may argue that the CHR, while not explicitly listed in Art. IX as a constitutional commission, can still be considered a constitutional commission because the Constitution itself created it.

I found a very interesting sentence in EO 163 s. 1987, Sec. 2(d), which states:

The Chairman and the Members of the Commission on Human Rights shall receive the same salary as the Chairman and Members, respectively, of the Constitutional Commissions, which shall not be decreased during their term of office.
Take a harder look at the phrase the same as the... members of the Constitutional Commissions.... Cory used the phrase of the Constitutional Commissions instead of of other Constitutional Commissions, implying that Cory herself may not have considered the CHR a constitutional commission to begin with.

But thats not enough to definitive answer the question so

Fiscal Autonomy of Constitutional Commissions
Article IX (A) Sec. 5 of the 1987 Constitution states:
The [Constitutional Commissions] shall enjoy fiscal autonomy. Their approved annual appropriations shall be automatically and regularly released.
In short, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the CHR should enjoy fiscal autonomy.

However, in CHR Employees vs CHR [GR No. 15536], the Supreme Court said:
This Court is convinced that the [Constitutional Committee] had intended to grant to the respondent the privilege of having its approved annual appropriations automatically and regularly released, but nothing more.
The High Court ruled that the CHR enjoys limited fiscal autonomy, as opposed to absolute fiscal autonomy accorded to the Constitutional Commissions. That is, if the CHR is a constitutional commission, then the Supreme Court would have categorically stated that CHR has fiscal autonomy in accordance with Art. IX (A) Sec. 5... but the Supreme Court did not. 

CHR cannot be a constitutional commission. 

Yes, the CHR is a Constitutional Office but it is NOT a Constitutional Commission.

Lets me restate:
The Supreme Court said the CHR enjoys LIMITED fiscal autonomy, which means it is not a Constitutional Commission, which enjoys full fiscal autonomy. Because CHR is not a constitutional commission, its members are NOT in the list of impeachable officials. 

Particularly, CHR chair Chito Gascon is not an impeachable official.

Not impeachable means no Immunity
Gascons not being an impeachable official means he does not enjoy the limited immunity accorded to impeachable officials like Comelec Chair Andres Bautista and Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales.

For example, Greco Belgicas disbarment case versus Ombudsman Morales was dismissed on the grounds that impeachable officials are immune to lawsuits that would in effect impeach them, as evidenced by Ombudsman vs CA and Mojica [GR No. 146846], where its stated that:
The Ombudsman or his deputies must first be removed from office via impeachment Should the tenure of the Ombudsman be thus terminated by impeachment, he may then be held to answer either criminally or administratively e.g., in disbarment proceedings
With Gascon not enjoying immunity, we can actually file administrative or criminal charges against him, charges that will not be dismissed on the ground of immunity, charges that, if proven, will merit his removal from the CHR.

Again, impeachment for Gascon wont be necessary: its just a matter of filing (and winning) administrative or criminal cases for Gascon to be removed from CHR and my sources tell me that a case is already in the works. [TP]

"The Impeachment Gambit: Connecting Trillanes, Bautista, Sereno, Robredo, and Marcos","After gaining lots of very useful contacts from the House of Representatives, I have discovered that the much-touted supermajority has finally started flexing its legislative muscles.

Inday, ilabas na ang chopping block!



Yesterday, Senator Richard Gordon finally filed an ethics complaint against Senator Antonio Sonny Trillanes IV. Referring to the complaint, Gordon said in an ambush interview yesterday, Its going to be filed today... I dont need signatories. I have the support of more than 10, more than 12, more than 14 [senators] [GMA].

Yes, the wheels have started turning and the public is very happy with the development, but lets not lose sight of the forest for trees, because it appears that Trillanes expulsion from the senate is just a small part of a series of moves in what appears to be a chess gambit.

DEFINITION: A gambit (from ancient Italian gambetto, meaning ""to trip"") is a chess opening in which a player, more often White, sacrifices material, usually a pawn, with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position [Brace 1979]
There are four key pieces involved in this gambit:
Senator Antonio Sonny Trillanes 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno 
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) chair Andres Andy Bautista 
Vice-president Maria Leonor Leni Robredo 
That is, a series of events, starting with Trillanes expulsion, will lead to a political chain reaction that may virtually annihilate any significant level of power that the Liberal Party has today.

Note that this will not be an article about what should happen. It is instead about what will likely happen in the Philippine political scene, an arena thats has so far been more lively and exciting than even the sappiest Mexican telenovela.

Lets go.

Move No. 1: Impeach Trillanes
In Sundays Gordons Ethics Complaint: Recent discoveries suggest Trillanes is toast, I explained how Gordons ethics complaint will have the support of a least 13 senators, with the vote of Senator Grace Poe OR Senator Win Gatchalian being the crucial 14th vote to complete the two-thirds majority required to expel Trillanes. There will only be 20 or 21 senators who will vote on the complaint.

Gordon, however, said yesterday that he has the support of 14 or more senators, so it appears that Gordon may have secured the Gatchalians support.
A highly-placed source from the senate independently confirmed that Sen. Gatchalian is very likely to support Gordons petition. So yeah, it seems that Gordon isnt bluffing.

While some netizens tell me that this should have been filed a long time ago. But then, remember that a certain Abelardo de Jesus filed an ethics complaint against Trillanes back in March 2017, and it didnt gain any traction [ABS]. That is, I think Gordons complaint was filed at just about the right time because it gave Trillanes enough time to piss off a sufficient number of senators.

As far as I am concerned, its just a matter of time before Trillanes, along with his horde of consultants, bids the Senate goodbye.

Trillanes pending exit, along with Sen. Leila de Limas detention and Sen. Alan Peter Cayetanos resignation, will put the total number of active senators to just 21. Thus, the original two-thirds majority from 16 (based on 24 senators) will be reduced to 14 (based on 21), making convictions in impeachment trials much easier to achieve.

As I have explained in my 26 August 2017 article Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt, there are eight would-be senator-judges who are likely to vote acquit in a prospective impeachment trial and that one of them is Trillanes. If Trillanes exits the senate, the maximum number of acquittal votes will be 7. Adding the fact that only 21 will be voting, Trillanes exit makes a sure acquittal scenario impossible.

Now, let's set that aside and talk about Andy.

Move No. 2: Impeach Bautista
There are several impeachment cases filed in the House of Representatives (HoR) today. They involve the following figures:
Supreme Court Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno 
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) chair Andres Andy Bautista 
Vice-president Maria Leonor Leni Robredo 
Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales 
Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales is set to retire in July 2018, or barely over ten months from now. Honestly speaking  and I believe most congressmen will agree with me  I think that impeaching Carpio-Morales will be a waste of time for the simple reason that shes about to exit anyway.
Meanwhile, I have read the verified complaint for the impeachment of Comelec chair Andy Bautista filed by Atty. Ferdie Topacio and former Negros Oriental Rep. Jacinto Paras. You can read for yourself by clicking here. Among the four or so grounds for impeachment cited, I believe that the fourth ground  SALN misdeclaration  is more than enough to get Bautista convicted in a senate impeachment trial.

A source, whos part of the HoR leadership, told me that Bautista has sent feelers to the office of House Speaker Pantaleon Bebot Alvarez. That is, Bautista supposedly informed the House leadership that he is intending to resign from his position soon.


With that said, I believe that the Lower House is giving Bautista some time to do it, so that it can focus on the other pending impeachment complaints, one of which may be transmitted to the Senate sooner than expected, and I am referring to

Move No. 3: Impeach Sereno
There are two verified complaints for the impeachment of Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno: one filed by Atty. Lorenzo Larry Gadon, and another by the non-government organization Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC). So far, Gadons complaint has been endorsed by 25 representatives [GMA] while 16 endorsed that of VACC [Inq].

Interestingly, another senior HoR source told me that a large number of representatives have volunteered to endorse these complaints but the House Speaker told them not to sign them yet, and for good reason.

You see, I checked the executive summary of Gadons complaint and the number of grounds cited is mind-boggling. For example, Topacios 22-page impeachment complaint against Bautista cites only four or five grounds, while Gadon cited TWENTY SEVEN. By simple ratio and proportion, Gadons actual complaint mustve been almost a hundred pages long, and thats not even counting the annexes!

Among the grounds cited are the following:
Falsifying two Supreme Court resolutions and a temporary restraining order, 
Delaying action on the retirement benefits of judicial personnel,
Manipulating and delaying a resolution after she lost in the voting, 
Manipulating shortlists of judicial nominees in three different occasions, 
Manipulating the Judicial and Bar Council itself, 
Using public funds to finance an extravagant lifestyle, including booking opulent hotel rooms, flying on first class, and having large contingents during official foreign visits. 
Ordering Muntinlupa judges not to issue warrants of arrest against Sen. Leila de Lima 
The list goes on and on. 

Suffice it to say, submitting this lengthy complaint as it is, may result in a senate trial thatll last forever.

You can check the executive summary of the impeachment case against CJ Sereno by clicking here.

Thus, I agree with Speaker Alvarez when he said said, ""Kung gusto lang namin na dumiretso sa impeachment court, kayang-kaya. Pwedeng gawin Pero ayaw kong gawin. Kasi gusto ko, dito pa lang i-hearing muna natin. Para makita muna natin kung may ebidensya ba o wala, whether it can stand trial in an impeachment court.

Yeah, I appreciate Bebots prudence because theres no point in hearing all twenty-seven grounds, as proving just one ground will be enough to remove Sereno from the judiciary.

I find Gadons complaint exceptionally long and meaty, and it happens to be so because

According to another HoR source, Supreme Court associate justices who have grudges against Sereno very willingly provide the evidence for her impeachment case. The source even told me that one of the associate justices keeps on calling a senior congressman to ask the latter about the progress of the complaint.

With that said, I am confident that the proponents of the impeachment case against Sereno will find no trouble in looking for evidence. Adding the fact that the pro-Sereno Senate minority bloc lacks numbers, I can confidently say that Sereno, like Trillanes, is toast. 

Move No. 4: Impeach Robredo
The first  and probably the most important  impeachment complaint filed in the Lower House is against VP Leni Robredo, yet its the one that has apparently gained the least traction.

According to another HoR source, its because the supermajority has never really tested its cohesion, that most house members are scared of endorsing the complaint because of potentially cataclysmic reprisals from the Liberal Party, if and when the latter regains power, e.g. in 2022 when Duterte steps down.

Sereno and Bautistas removal, made more likely Trillanes expulsion, may encourage the representative to temper their fears. That is, Sereno and Bautista will serve as the guinea pigs  the laboratory rats  so the HoR can see how far it can go. That is, the removal of these two can embolden the congressmen to support the impeachment case against Leni Robredo.

Yes, if Trillanes, Sereno, and Bautista go bye-bye, Leni will probably go bye-bye too.

The Trillanes-Bautista-Sereno-Robredo Connection
Interestingly, Sereno, Bautista, and Robredo share at least one common denominator: Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos, Jr.s (BBM) pending electoral protest.

First, Bautista reportedly conspired with Senator and losing VP candidate Francis Chiz Escudero to transfer the latters 2016 votes to Robredo, allowing the latter to win over Marcos by a hairs breadth [FB].

Second, Sereno has seemingly been finding ways to further delay the progress of BBMs electoral protest case. In my article #OustDuterte: Leni, Lourdes, Loida, LP, and Plan 0117, for example, I explained how the Sereno stalled by delaying the preliminary conference on the BBM protest case. The preliminary conference, which should have been held in late August or early September of last year, was held almost one year later in July 2017 [CNN].

Third, Robredo, obviously because shes the respondent in the BBM electoral protest case.

Let me tell you why this is relevant.

By removing Trillanes, the senatorial roster will be down to 21, so that the required two-thirds majority conviction will be easier to obtain, i.e. itll be easier to remove Sereno, Bautista, and Robredo, assuming that none of them will resign before that happens.

By removing Bautista, it will be easier for BBM to access Comelec records because Bautista isnt there to cockblock him. It will also be easier to subpoena Bautista because he cannot hide behind his powerful Comelec throne anymore.

By removing Sereno, a speedier trial on the electoral protest will ensue, as Sereno wont be there to delay the proceedings anymore. No more waiting for months and months just to wait for even more months and months.

By removing Leni Robredo, the prospective ex-VP will run out of reasons for delaying the case. For one, she cannot use the I dont have money alibi [Inq] anymore, an alibi that she has used to further delay the proceedings. After all, Robredos removal implies her becoming a private citizen again, i.e. she will be able accept donations without many legal roadblocks.

In short, the removal of the three will speed up the BBM case.

But it doesnt end there.

2019 Senatorial Elections
Speeding up the protest case is essential for BBM because he may need to have it resolved before May 2019, i.e. the 2019 senatorial elections because he will suffer from the Defensor Doctrine, after some highly-placed sources in Malacaang told me that BBM plans to run for senator in 2019.
DEFENSOR DOCTRINE: In Defensor vs Ramos [P.E.T. Case No. 01], the Presidential Electoral Tribunal ruled that the late Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiagos 1992 electoral protest case against then-President Fidel V. Ramos has been rendered moot and academic after Defensor-Santiago ran and took office as Senator in 1995.
That is, if BBM runs for senate in 2019 and takes office, his electoral protest against Robredo, where he has paid P66 million so far [CNN], will be dismissed. Thus, removing Sereno and Bautista is well within BBMs political interests, whether he admits it or not.

Some may argue that the Marcoses may let Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos run for Senate so BBM can avoid forfeiture of the case. However, this comes with great political risk because many northern politicians agree that without a Marcos in Ilocos to keep the entire province together, bloody feuding among Ilocano political warlords may resume.

Thus, the scenario thats most beneficial, as far as the Marcoses are concerned, is one that involves a pre-election resolution of the electoral protest case.

The Marcos Wealth Negotiations
With that said, the timing of the Marcos Familys offer to settle with government is fascinating, to say the least.

If you can recall, I said in Fridays Bye-bye LP? Political implications of the Duterte-Marcos negotiations that these Marcos wealth negotiations may translate into a Marcos Family with greater bargaining power under the Duterte Administration.

Are the Marcoses supporting the removal of Trillanes, Bautista, and Sereno? I can try to ask Ilocos Norte Gov. Imee Marcos about it, but will she dignify that question? Of course, not. I wouldnt if I were in her place.

Well, as the saying goes:
In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.
Regardless, whats clear here is that at the end of the day, what we might see is a real life chess game that will put Kasparov, Spassky, and Fischer to shame.

The flip-side of all these, however, is that the administration must exercise great prudence in messaging if not in strategizing, [TP]

Gordons Ethics Complaint: Recent discoveries suggest Trillanes is toast,"Recent discoveries about dynamics inside the Senate virtually ensure Trillanes expulsion.

A Quick Recap
In Bye-bye Trillanes? How far will Gordons ethics complaint go?, I analyzed the Senates possible voting behavior on Senator Richard Dick Gordons prospective ethics complaint against Senator Antonio Sonny Trillanes IV, based on each senators political interests.

If you haven't read that article, I strongly suggest that do before you read this one.

In that article, I explained the steps involved in the processing an ethics complaint, namely:
Someone files a complaint.
Ethics committee (EC) hears the complaint then votes on it. The complaint will be endorsed to the senate plenary if a simple majority (50% + 1) approves of it. The committee has seven in it, so four votes are required.
If EC endorses the complaint, then senate plenary tackles it and votes on it. The complaint will successfully cause the suspension and/or expulsion of the senator-in-question if it gathers two-thirds of the senators votes. There are 22 in the plenary, so fifteen votes are required.
In seven-person Ethics Committee, I predicted that the Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will almost certainly vote for the complaint, so the vote of either Honasan or Poe is necessary.

In the 22-person plenary, meanwhile, I predicted twelve yes senator-voters, namely:  Pimentel,  Ejercito,  Zubiri,  Pacquiao,  Sotto,  Lacson,  Honasan,  Villar,  Binay,  Angara,  Gordon, and  Legarda.

I also predicted the five no senator-voters, namely:  Aquino the Ninoy Cosplayer,  Pangilinan-Cuneta,  Drilon,  Hontiveros, and  Trillanes.

With this, I explained that it would be necessary for three of the remaining five maybes   Gatchalian,  Villanueva,  Recto,  Poe, and  Escudero  to vote for the complaint if the Trillanes is to be expelled.

Discovery No. 1: Trillanes will be forced to inhibit
DLSU Political Science professor Antonio Contreras informed me today that the defendant in an ethics complaint is not allowed to vote on it, and this totally changes the ballgame.

Lets recall the members of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges:
Sotto
Lacson
Pacquiao
Honasan
Poe
Hontiveros
Trillanes
Trillanes is a part of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Privileges. If he will not be allowed to vote, then the total number of members is six. Like what Ive explained in the previous article, Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will almost certainly vote in favor of the complaint. Thus, even if Honasan, Poe, and Hontiveros vote to dismiss the complaint, the tally will still be 3-3.

The committee chairman  in this case Sotto  usually provides the tie-breaker vote, but owing to the sensitivity of the issue, my senate insider-friends and I predict that Sotto will push for the convening of the Committee of the Whole, similar to what happened in 2010 when then Senator Maria Ana Consuelo Jamby Madrigal filed an ethics complaint against then Senator Manuel Manny Villar, Jr., over the C-5 controversy [Senate].
The Committee of the Whole rule refers to the whole membership of a legislative house, in this case the Senate, sitting as a committee and operating under informal rules [MW]. Thus, even a 3-3 tie vote will result in a de facto endorsement to the Senate Plenary, as the members of the Committee of the Whole and the members of the Senate Plenary are, pretty much, one and the same.

In short, Trillanes forcible inhibition inevitably results into a endorsement of Gordons ethics complaint to the Plenary.

Now, Trillanes will also inhibit from voting at the Committee of the Whole, so the total number of voter-senators will thus be 21.

But wait, theres more!

Discovery # 2: Trillanes may move to exclude Gordon from voting
As the defendant, Trillanes may file a motion to exclude the complainant Gordon. Gordon may accede to Trillanes motion, although this will still be subject to voting by the Committee of the Whole. Thus, we are left with two scenarios: (A) Gordon votes, and (B) Gordon inhibits.

If Gordon votes, the total number of senator-voters in the plenary will be 21, so that the required two-thirds majority vote to expel Trillanes is 14. If Gordon inhibits, the total number of senator-voters in the plenary will be 20, and two-thirds will still be 14.

Truth be told, I believe it wont matter much because Trillanes has made so many enemies in the Senate, it wont be too difficult to find someone wholl vote against him.

Let me explain further.

Discovery # 3: A not-so-solid Liberal Party
Lets exclude Gordon and assume that only 11 will surely vote to expel Trillanes, so we need three more for 15 votes (2/3 majority), as only 20 will be voting on the ethics complaint.

As you may recall, four  senators   Aquino the Ninoy Cosplayer,  Pangilinan-Cuneta,  Hontiveros the Kidnapper, and  Drilon  have already issued a statement in support of Trillanes [Star]. All these four Senators are from the Liberal Party (LP). Well, Hontiveros is Akbayan, but we all know that Akbayan is LP Lite.

Interestingly, the other two LP senators  Villanueva and Recto  did not sign the statement, and for good reason. Villanueva is technically from CIBAC but he ran under the LP ticket.
Senate insiders told me that both Recto and Villanueva strongly dislike Trillanes and they will almost certainly vote against the coup plotter. For one, my senate sources told me that both have less than rosy words to say about Trillanes when speaking about the latter in the senate corridors.

Yes, my senate sources are very confident that the two will vote against Trillanes, bringing the total of yes votes to 13.

One more.

Discovery # 4: Escudero likely to vote No.
The remaining maybes are Poe, Escudero, Gatchalian.
Lets face it: Escudero is a TraPo (traditional politician) in every sense of the word. He looks like one, talks like one, and acts like one. Despite that, Escudero, unlike Hontiveros, is not stupid. He is an astute politician, in the sense that he knows how to play survival politics.

In that case, I am confident that he will vote no because of the prospective Andy Bautista impeachment case.

In Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt, I explained that Escudero may be convinced to acquit embattled Comelec chair Andres Bautista, because Bautistas removal may uncover Escuderos reported maneuverings during the 2016 National Elections.

According to my sources, Escudero gave the Comelec the go-signal to transfer votes for him to VP Leni Robredo, allowing the latter to overtake Bongbong Marcos by a hair's breadth [FB].


Thus so far, we have 13 expel votes and 5 retain votes.

Discovery # 5: Gatchalians and Poe's respective predicaments.
The remaining maybes are Poe and Gatchalian and we still need one more vote to expel Trillanes from the senate.
Gatchalian has a pending graft case at the Sandiganbayan, as Ive explained in a previous article. Thus, it may be in his political interest to side with Duterte, since that case will probably reach the Supreme Court. By the time it does, Duterte would have appointed at least ten SC associate justices [TP: SC Math] or even eleven, as Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno may be removed as her impeachment case gains major traction in the Lower House [Star].

Poe, on the other hand, is part of Senate President Aquilino Koko Pimentels majority bloc. Poes term ends in 2019, and I am confident that shes gunning for re-election. Even if she votes in favor of Trillanes (or abstains, which essentially has the same effect), she may still win in 2019.

The problem, however, is whether that prospective 2019 senatorial win, despite being a win, may still turn out to be an embarrassment.
Recall the Poe was on top of the senatorial winners in the 2013 elections. Her placing anywhere lower than 3rd will be politically humiliating because it will imply that the populace isnt as confident in her as before. And I think this will happen if she doesnt vote to expel Antonio, who is probably the most hated public figure right now, except possibly for No, Trillanes really is the most hated today.

Absolving Trillanes will also be disastrous for her long-term political ambitions. Remember that she ran for president in 2016 and lost, but the general consensus back then was that shes still too young and inexperienced for the presidency. To be fair, many of those who didnt vote for her, and even some who did, felt that she has better chances if she runs in 2022.


But if she absolves Trillanes, she might as well kiss those dreams goodbye.

Harsh? Yes, but true.


Discovery #6: Duterte will call Koko
Now, lets recall that we have 13 expel votes so far, and we need one more vote from either Gatchalian or Poe. 

President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly said that he doesnt meddle with the affairs of the legislature. But I have reason to believe that this is just lip service. Duterte isnt stupid: he will use backdoor channels to get things done.

We all know that Duterte has publicly displayed his dislike of Trillanes, with him even announcing that hed advise his son, Davao City vice-mayor Paolo Duterte, to remain silent at the senate hearings [CNN].

Earlier today, Duterte even likened Trillanes to a terrorist group when he said in a mix of Cebuano and Tagalog [Inq]:
This Trillanes (is a) political ISIS. He has no talent. He will not he does not even know (the difference) between a democrat and a member of a party. How can I expect (him to know)? He lacks what he knows in life is not enough.
The list goes on and on but whats clear is that, if given the option, Duterte would probably rather have Trillanes become a private citizen. 

I expect Duterte to discreetly summon Pimentel to Malacaang and ask the latter to serve as a senatorial whip and influence the majority members to vote in favor of Malacaangs interests. Poe and Gatchalian are both members of the senate majority, of which Pimentel, being the Senate President, is the de facto head.

Imagine the humiliation on Pimentels part if it turns out that the majority bloc is a majority bloc only by name?

I believe that Pimentel is an astute politician. Unlike Hontiveros, he is not stupid: he is a bar topnotcher for crying out loud! I am confident that he can find a way to whip Poe and Gatchalian into submission, if only for the sake of his own political survival.

Note, however, that he needs only one more vote, and I am confident that Poe and Gatchalian, neither of whom are idiots like Hontiveros, will yield. With that said, I predict 14 or even 15 votes in favor of expelling Trillanes, and only five votes against.

Thus, even with Gordon out of the picture, Trillanes will still be toast

UPDATE: 1:51 AM 04 September 2017

I was notified that Gatchalian's graft cases have been dismissed by the Sandiganbayan months ago, thus giving Gatchalian less incentive in voting against Trillanes. For now, I will assume that Gatchalian will vote to dismiss the ethics complaint, so that makes Poe's vote necessary for Trillanes' expulsion.

Bye-bye Trillanes? How far will Gordons ethics complaint go?,"We are all familiar with Antonio Trillanes antics in the Senate. Looking back in history, I can recall that he has clashed with Senators Enrile, Sotto, Cayetano, Lacson, and Zubiri, to name a few. Trillanes got away with all of them, but it appears that he may not get away this time, when he insulted Senator Richard Gordons Blue Ribbon Committee, calling it a comite de absuelto during a 29 August 2017 senate hearing.

This case is more important that most of us think. If Trillanes is expelled, there will only be 21 active senators left, making Comelec chair Andy Bautista's prospective impeachment trial more likely to result into a conviction, as explained in ""Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt"".

I will not discuss anymore the why behind Senator Gordons prospective ethics complaint because I believe that the reader is already familiar with what kind of senator Trillanes is. Instead, I will attempt to explain the journey that Gordons complaint will take, along with the odds of it succeeding in expelling Trillanes from the Senate once and for all.


Lets start.

When Gordon files a complaint
Senator Gordon said hes already preparing the ethics complaint against Senator Trillanes in as early as the evening of Thursday, 31 August 2017 [Politiko]. I expect him to file the complaint on Monday, 04 September, since 01 September is a public holiday.

As expected, the Liberal Party-led minority bloc opposed Gordons plans per a statement signed by Senators Aquino, de Lima, Drilon, Hontiveros, and Pangilinan [News5]. Nothing new there.

In an 01 September 2017 interview at [Karambola sa DWIZ], Gordon categorically said that his ethics complaint aims not at suspending Trillanes, but from expelling him from the organization for good. I have tried searching for past incidents where the Senate expelled one of its members but I havent found any, so this might be a historic first for the institution.

Trillanes and Gordon have traded barbs [Politiko] since the fateful 29 August senate hearing and Gordon is showing no signs of backing down on his threat.

Yes, I think Gordon will really file a complaint, so lets assume that he indeed will, so whats next?


When Ethics Committee takes up complaint

The Senate Ethics committee will receive Gordons complaint, a hearing (or several) will be held, and the committee members will vote by simple majority on whether the complaint will be endorsed to the plenary or not.
The members of the Senate Ethics Committee are:
Tito Sotto (Chairman)
Ping Lacson 
Gringo Honasan
Grace Poe
Manny Pacquiao
Risa Hontiveros
Antonio Trillanes

The Pro-expulsion Votes
 Sotto
Ethics committee chairman Tito Sotto is irked at Trillanes. During the same 29 August hearing, Trillanes accused him of trying to prevent witnesses from testifying, to which he irritatedly replied, I said, 'Pag-aralan muna ng committee sapagkat hearsay.' It doesn't mean na 'huwag'. Huwag mo 'kong pagbibintangan [TP].""

Sotto will probably vote against Trillanes.

 Lacson
Lacson isnt very fond of Trillanes either. In July 2017, Trillanes called several majority bloc senators cowards. In response, Lacson said, Calling ones own colleagues cowards or puppets wholesale and without qualifying, is the darndest thing he can do [Inq]. Lacson is also part of the Senate Justice Committee, and hes been witness to Trillanes maneuverings during the senate hearing on extrajudicial killings held in October of last year.

Lacson will probably vote against Trillanes.

 Pacquiao
Pacquiao, like Sotto and Lacson, is not very fond of Trillanes either. In March 2017, Trillanes sarcastically said like some of his colleagues, Lascaas did not also become a saint after his spiritual renewal. In response, the very religious Pacquiao said, Para bang hindi ako totoong tao, para bang yung pagiging Christian ko e fake thats very offended (sic) to me (TRANSLATION: Like Im a fake person, like my Christianity is fake and thats very offending for me.) [Inq]

Pacquiao will probably vote against Trillanes.

The Wishy-washy and Anti-expulsion votes
 Hontiveros, and,  Trillanes
Hontiveros and Trillanes will clearly vote against the ethics complaint, after Hontiveros previously signed a statement supporting Trillanes and Trillanes is not expected to vote against himself. Nothing surprising there.

 Poe
Poe said earlier today that the ethics complaint is unnecessary [Star], which I find perplexing. You see, everybody expects Poe to run in 2019, and I find it confusing that she has to release statements that will hurt her chances of getting re-elected. But she said what she said, so lets just assume for now that shell vote against the complaint.

Will Poe vote for or against the ethics complaint? Anything is possible at this moment.

But with that said, let me give this short message to Senator Poe:

Grace, please think hard. Being clumped with Hontiveros and Trillanes will spell an end to your budding political career. Yes, it will end your career.

I put the odds at 50% in favor of the ethics complaint, 50% against.

 Honasan
The usually quiet Senator Gringo Honasan is another wild card because of his associations. On one hand, Trillanes was once a Honasans protg. Honasan, himself a well-known coup plotter in the Cory Aquino years [LATimes], strongly supported Trillanes amnesty while the latter was still in jail for the failed 2003 Oakwood Mutiny [ABS].

On the other hand, hes part of the three-senator Macho Bloc, the others being Lacson and Sotto, who are also members of the Senate Ethics Committee. Lacson and Sotto are likely to vote against Trillanes, and that fact can influence Honasans vote. Moreover, Duterte himself admitted to helping Honasan hide while the latter was still being hunted by previous governments [Star].

Does Gringo still have some sympathy left for Antonio, or will he side with his Macho peers?

I put the odds at 70% in favor of the ethics complaint, 30% against.

When Senate Ethics committee votes on complaint
To summarize, the probability of voting IN FAVOR of the ethics complaint against Trillanes will be:
1. Tito Sotto  100%
2. Ping Lacson  100%
3. Manny Pacquiao  100%
4. Gringo Honasan  70%
5. Grace Poe  50%
6. Risa Hontiveros  0%
7. Antonio Trillanes  0%
I expect Hontiveros and Trillanes to vote against the complaint. Sotto, Lacson, and Pacquiao will vote in favor of it. Thus, its up to Honasan and Poe for the clincher. Note, however, that only four  votes are needed for the ethics complaint to prosper, so only one pro-expulsion vote is required from Honasan and Poe.

That is, I think the odds of Gordons complaint being endorsed to the Senate plenary are pretty good.

When plenary takes up ethics complaint
RULE XXXIV, Section 97 of the [Rules of the Senate] states:
Upon the recommendation of the Committee on Ethics and Privileges, the Senate may punish any Member for disorderly behavior and, with the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of the entire membership, suspend or expel a Member. A penalty of suspension shall not exceed sixty  calendar days.
Note that Gordon is not seeking Trillanes suspension: he wants Trillanes expelled from the Senate.
Based on this rule, after a majority of Senate Ethics Committee members vote in favor of Gordons ethics complaint, its time endorse the complaint to the senate plenary, i.e. the senate as a whole will vote on the ethics complaint.

There are 22 active senators right now, as Senator De Lima is in detention for drug trafficking charges [GMA] and is thus unable to vote, while Senator Cayetano has resigned from the Senate after accepting his nomination as Foreign Affairs secretary [GMA].


Thus, two-thirds of 22 is 14.74, i.e. the ethics complaint needs affirmative votes from fifteen  senators.

Before we go any further, let me be clear about one thing: this is Politics at work. We can choose to remain nave by convincing ourselves about rainbows, butterflies, and unicorns, but the fact remains that in this issue  and for most political issues for that matter  political loyalties and personal political interests take primacy.

Now that we got that settled, lets move on with my predictions on voting behavior.
Probable Affirmative Votes

The PDP-Laban bloc will most likely vote in favor of the complaint. The PDP Laban Bloc members are:
1. Pimentel
2. Ejercito
3. Zubiri
4. Pacquiao
Note that Ejercito has already expressed support for Gordon's complaint [MT].

The Macho Bloc members, all of whom are also members of the Ethics committee, are expected to maintain their stances, and will thus most likely vote in favor of the complaint. The Macho Bloc members are:
5. Sotto
6. Lacson
7. Honasan
The Lone Wolves, who are either allied to the administration or are belligerent towards the opposition, are likely to vote against Trillanes too. These are:
8. Villar
9. Binay
10. Angara
So far, we have 10 votes in favor of expelling Trillanes, so we need five  more, and heres where it gets interesting.

The NPC bloc may note vote as one in light of Poes pronouncements against the ethics case, so lets evaluate those who are likely to vote affirmative.
11. Gordon
Gordon is the complainant himself. This is a no-brainer.
12. Legarda
Legarda is generally pro-administration, though not as pro-administration as, say, Pacquiao or the former Senator Cayetano. With that said, however, Malacaang sources tell me that Legarda is being considered for nomination as Environment or Social Work secretary. If thats the case, Legardas political interests suggest that she will likely vote in favor of the complaint.
So far, we have 12 votes, so three more.

Sway Votes and No Votes
As mentioned earlier, several LP-aligned senators have openly opposed the ethics complaint. These are:
""No"" # 1. Aquino
""No"" # 2. Pangilinan
""No"" # 3. Drilon
""No"" # 4. Hontiveros
De Lima also opposed the complaint but she wont vote on it anyway because shes currently detained in Camp Crame. Trillanes is also expected to vote against the measure.
""No"" # 5. Trillanes
Meanwhile, Poe can swing both ways based on her recent statements. Escudero is another unpredictable, so I think that just like Poe, he can swing both ways.
""Maybe"" # 1. Poe
""Maybe"" # 2. Escudero
So far, we have 19 senators accounted for, so we have three more to evaluate. The remaining four are:
Gatchalian
Villanueva
Recto
""Maybe"" # 3. Gatchalian
Gatchalian been generally neutral on Dutertes policies so far. He publicly shared differing views on the South China Sea ruling, and he was one of the first to call for a review of Dutertes martial law decalaration. Note, however, that he ended up backing the latter [Inq].

Moreover, Gatchialian has a pending graft case at the Sandiganbayan [Inq]. Thus, it may be in his political interest to side with Duterte, since that case will probably reach the Supreme Court. By the time that case reaches the high court, Duterte would have appointed at least ten SC associate justices [TP: SC Math]. 

I think Gatchalians odds would be just like Honasans in the committee level.

""Maybe"" # 4. Villanueva
Joel Villanueva, while still a member of the Liberal Party, is part of the Duterte-friendly majority bloc. Villanueva is generally seen to be pro-Duterte, after photos of Villanueva's father Bro. Eddie of the Jesus is Lord movement praying over Duterte surfaced online weeks prior to the elections. That is, I believe Eddie will exert influence on Joels vote.

I think Villanuevas odds would be just like Honasans in the committee level.
""Maybe"" # 5. Recto
Recto is generally cordial with Trillanes but Recto has joined the administration-friendly majority bloc several months ago [GMA]. In fairness to Recto, I think he is quite neutral and fair in his decisions, so he can swing both ways (50-50).


Predicting the Voting Tally
Lets summarize what weve discussed in the previous section. To recall, two of the 24 senators (De Lima and Cayetano) are out, so well have 22 active senators in the plenary.

The extremely highly probable affirmative votes are:
1. Pimentel
2. Ejercito
3. Zubiri
4. Pacquiao
5. Sotto
6. Lacson
7. Honasan
8. Villar
9. Binay
10. Angara
11. Gordon
12. Legarda
The sway votes are:
13. Gatchalian (70-30)
14. Villanueva (70-30)
15. Poe (50-50)
16. Escudero (50-50)
17. Recto (50-50)
The extremely highly probable negative votes are:
1. Drilon
2. Pangilinan
3. Trillanes
4. Hontiveros
5. Aquino
The $64 Question: Backdoor Negotiations?
The odds of Gordons ethics complaint receiving a 2/3 affirmative vote are pretty good, but it is by no means certain. Thus, its important for Gordon, along with other camps who want to expel Trillanes, to secure three out of the five sway votes. Thus, we are left with the following questions:
Will Gordon use political capital to convince the senators? 
Will there be a rare display of decisiveness on the part of Poe?
Will Joel Villanueva decide based on what his dad would want?
Will Recto, after years of being an LP outcast, emancipate himself from the partys clutches?
And most importantly
Will the Duterte Administration influence the Senate?
Your guess is as good as mine but whichever way it goes, I think that Trillanes immediate political survival is very seriously under threat.

And here's a special message to Senator Poe: Your decision on this matter may make or break your political career, so please vote wisely. They nation's eyes are on you right now [TP].

Bye-bye LP? Political implications of the Duterte-Marcos negotiations,"Rodrigo Duterte never fails to surprise me.

In a 29 August 2017 speech in Malacaang, President Rodrigo Duterte said [Video]:
The Marcoses  I will not name the spokesman  they said theyll open everything and probably return those [assets] that were already found. They said, You have a large [budget] deficit maybe this year the projected deficit will be big, they said,  but [the amount to be returned] wont be much. But we are ready to open and bring back [the assets], they said, including a few gold bars.
Yes, the Marcoses has finally decided to reach out to the government to talk about their wealth. The announcement is so simple and straightforward, even I had to take a couple of days to digest what happened. Why? Because what may happen, the way the issue was announced, and the political and economic implications of this gesture are discombobulating, to the say the least.


The Announcement
Duterte carefully chose his words when he spoke about the issue.

First, Duterte clearly said that negotiations are ongoing, and probably without asking the Marcoses if he can make such announcement. Even if the talks are very preliminary, this puts major pressure on the Marcoses. After the surprise announcement will make backing out very politically costly because the public generally hates #paasa or flakers.

Second, Duterte, aware of the pressure on the Marcoses, apparently tried to decrease it by saying that the amount wont be much. But not much is a very relative term, and I think hes trying to flip the odds to the governments favor. The Marcoses supposedly raised the idea to help Duterte respond to a looming massive budget deficit so it will be embarrassing for the Marcoses if the talks result to a very small amount.

Third, Duterte said he will get impartial people to handle the negotiations: a former chief justice (probably the retired Chief Justice Renato Puno), a Certified Public Accountant, and a universally-recognized representative. This way, he can minimize suspicions by providing a considerable level of transparency.

Fourth, Duterte never used the word stolen. Duterte used the word found, return, help, and the like, but he never used neither ill-gotten nor stolen, and heres where his political realism clearly shows. By not using those two words, he is paving the way for the return of the wealth while at the same time providing the Marcoses some leeway for messaging. After all, they are already trying to return some money, so why do we need to humiliate them right now?

Fifth, Duterte also said that he wants to do something worthwhile for the Filipino, and I think hes on his way to doing that. The Philippine Commission on Good Government (PCGG) has been running after Marcos wealth for over 30 years with limited success, and here are the Marcoses intending to return money by their own initiative. Even if were just talking about a few tens or hundreds of billions, the amount will still go a long way in helping poor Filipinos.

Political implications: The Marcos Family
The latest initiative of the Marcos family is really surprising, in that it totally came out from left field. Who among any of the familys critics thought something like this can ever happen? Regardless of the amount that will be agreed upon, the mere fact that family is now willing to even talk about it is shocking, to say the least.
Many camps argue that whatever the Marcoses will return will just be a very small fraction of whatever they got. However, we need to keep two things in mind:  the fact that they will willingly return it and  the fact that they are confident that the amount will significantly help in reducing the budget deficit, which is expected to have reached P147 billion at the end of July 2017 [MT].

Yeah, thats a LOT of money.

But then, if theres one thing that everybody  regardless of political color  will agree on, its that the Marcoses are not stupid, so they expect something in return.

What do they expect?

The Marcoses, I believe, expect political capital which translates to:

1: A possibly softer anti-Marcos stance among the anti-Marcos public
The Marcos Family may be expecting many anti-Marcos voters, many of whom were born after Martial Law, to soften their anti-Marcos stance even by a bit. While the staunchest Marcos critics probably will never forgive the Marcoses even when hell freezes over, the fact of the matter is that many voters today did not personally experience life under the dictatorship and thus do not hold much of a grudge against the former first family. or have a favorable view of the Marcoses to begin with. Proof? Bongbong Marcos performance in the 2016 Presidential Elections.

2: Greater bargaining power under the Duterte Administration
I interviewed Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos a couple of weeks ago and I asked her why Duterte doesnt influence the House of Representatives regarding the Tobacco Excise Tax Hearing plaguing the Ilocos Norte Government, including the governor herself. She said she doesnt want to impose on the president because nahihiya. I am not sure if she is not telling me something, but this may imply that the Marcoses, while influential in Dutertes inner circle, is not as influential as we think. So how do the Marcoses enhance their influence? By doing the Dutertes Government a favor.

3: A possible recalibration of history
In his speech, Duterte said the Marcos familys liaison, whoever he or she is, claims that the Ferdinand Marcos took the money to protect the economy in the eventuality that hes removed from power, in the hopes of regaining Malacaang.

I am disinclined to buy this story but truth be told, such a narrative is not a hard sell among a Filipino public that are first hand witnesses to the incompetence and corruption of Marcos Archnemesis, the Aquinos, along with their Liberal Party cohorts.

The Marcoses, for example, may ask the public, What if we gave this much earlier and Mar Roxas got it?.
Note, however, that I used the term recalibration instead of rewrite because  I doubt that anybody can drastically change what's already in history books with just one act.

When I said recalibration, I mean a slightly less diabolical portrayal not necessarily of the Marcos Regime, but that of the living Marcoses who have been, for decades, at the receiving end of criticisms against the late president.

With these said, I believe that the Marcos Familys plans to return the wealth, if realized, will go a long way in making a prospective 2022 BBM presidency palatable for more people, and this will serve as a challenge to other presidential hopefuls to step up their game.

Why? Because the Marcoses have already stepped up their game BIG TIME.

Political implications: The Liberal Party
If theres one camp that will be most adversely affected by this development, itd be the Aquino-aligned Liberal Party of the Philippines, the main political party that cultivated anti-Marcos sentiment and benefitted the most from it.

Lets get a few quotes from senior Liberal Party politicians as they reacted to this news.

From Senator and Liberal Party president Francis Pangilinan[Malaya]:
""There is no reason for us to believe in the sincerity of the Marcos family. They should return ill-gotten wealth and apologize for the sins of the dictatorship. Only then we would believe in their sincerity.""
From Senator and Ninoy cosplayer Bam Aquino [Abante]:
Dapat lang ibalik talaga `yan. Now ang tanong magkano po ang porsyentong ibabalik baka naman yung ibabalik po dyan kakarampot lang dun sa totoong ninakaw sa atin.
TRANSLATION: It should really be returned. Now, the question is how much will be returned because they just be returning a very small fraction of what they really stole from us.
From Vice-president and Liberal Party Chairman Leni Robredo [Malaya]:
""If they are returning the wealth... they should return everything because this belongs to the Filipinos.""

Whats clear in these LP quotes is the partys insistence on the Marcoses returning ALL of the money, despite them having no idea on how to go about that, while former President Corazon Aquinos PCGG has been here since the mid-80s, yet it managed to recover nothing but scraps.

I think LPs fear is rooted on their very reason for existing in the first place.
In the May 2016 ThinkingPinoy article Quantifying Discontent: An Analysis of the Bongbong Marcos Phenomenon, I explained that for the past 30 years, the Aquinos and the Liberal Party painted themselves as the antithesis  the polar opposites  of the Marcoses. The Aquinos and the Liberal Party painted themselves as the ultimate hero as they painted the Marcos Family as the ultimate villain... and therein lies the problem.

Batman once said, A hero is only as good as his villain, so what if, in the eyes of the public, the ultimate villain turns out to not be as evil as the people thought he was?


I am not saying that Ferdie should be a saint... but he sure is not the devil incarnate.


Yes, the Aquinos and LP will lose the justification for their existence. Yeah, their most ardent supporters will continue to support them, but I doubt if their numbers would even be enough to elect a provincial governor.

The Liberal Party, which is already struggling for survival, will probably struggle even more.

Political implications: The Duterte Presidency
Individuals and states, while both basing actions on morality, use a different hierarchy of moral principles. For example, the individual may subscribe to the saying Fiat justitia, pereat mundus (Let justice be done, even if the world perish), but the state cant possibly do the same if it threatens the states very survival [Morgenthau 1978].

That is how a Political Realist thinks. That is how Duterte thinks. Duterte the President, more than anything, is a Political Realist.

In the October 2016 ThinkingPinoy article Genius! The Method to Dutertes Foreign Policy Madness, I explained how Dutertes seemingly irrational, morally reprehensible action of cursing at then-US President Barack Obama, actually has a method to it. That is, calling Obama a son of a bitch made the Chinese public more receptive to Duterte and the Philippines, paving the way for a more independent Philippine foreign policy.

Dutertes Political Realism has again become evident when, in response to Marcos offer to return some wealth, he said:
I will accept that explanation (Marcos Familys alibi), whether or not it is true, we cant do much about it anyway and theyre ready to return the [the assets].
That is, while many camps would demand the Marcoses to return an arm and a leg, Duterte took into account the PCGGs general inability to recover assets and the governments immediate financial needs. 

Duterte was basically made to choose between:
Accepting the alibi then accepting a massive injection into government coffers, and, 
Rejecting that alibi, which would make the Marcoses retract, as the PCGG spends another 30 years looking for crumbs, with no assurance of success.
To Duterte, the choice was obvious: he picked the option that will translate to real improvements to Filipino lives.
How many post-Yolanda houses will that build? 
How many hospitals will it fund? 
How many roads will that create? 
All these questions would be useless to ask if Duterte insisted that the Marcoses return everything, whatever everything means.

If the negotiations translate to a final deal and the money changes hands, this will cement Dutertes reputation for being a doer, starkly in contrast to Mar Roxas analysis paralysis. This will enhance Dutertes political capital and by extension, whoever he will endorse in the 2019 and 2022 elections.

Yes, there may still be many issues that the Filipino People must settle with the Marcoses. However, this development, if fully realized, will be a victory for all... except for the Liberal Party.

Andy Bautista exit more likely after Hontiveros kidnapping stunt,"In yesterdays The Kidnapper-Senator Risa Hontiveros, I explained how Senator Risa Hontiveros is criminally liable for violating, among others, the law against kidnapping and serious illegal detention. Save for the usual dilatory tactics associated with moneyed defendants, I expect a pretty speedy trial, as the elements of the crime can be very easily proven.

But the ramifications of Hontiveros audacity extends beyond the confines of the courtroom, as her stupidest move yet come with blowbacks that her tiny brain was unable to foresee.


But before we go to that, lets first discuss the impeachment case against the embattled Comelec chair.

The Andy Bautista Impeachment Case
Two impeachment cases have so far been filed against embattled Comelec Chair Andres Andy Bautista. The first one, from Atty. Oliver Lozano, will not go far because hes basically a serial nuisance filer, as he has filed (usually frivolous) impeachment cases against every president since the 1990s [Star]. With that said, I doubt that thered be a congressman willing to endorse it.

The second one filed yesterday by Rep. Jacinto Paras and Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, however, was endorsed by House Deputy Speaker Gwen Garcia, Kabayan Party-list Rep. Harry Roque, and Rep. Abraham Tolentino of Cavite[CNN].

Yes, the second one is a go.
The second complaint cited five grounds for impeachment [GMA]:
Betrayal of Public Trust for failing to implement the Data Privacy Act of 2012 that led to the Comeleaks incident, the biggest data breach incident in history [NPC], where confidential information about tens of millions of voters were leaked for everyone to see.
Betrayal of Public Trust for declining to assume direct control of the task force created after the Comeleaks incident.
Betrayal of Public Trust for saying that the  modification is merely cosmetic in nature, effectively attempting to exonerate those responsible for it.
Betrayal of Public Trust for filing incomplete SALNs.
Bribery for receiving commissions from the Divina Law office.

Evaluating the Grounds
The first two grounds have been extensively discussed in a National Privacy Commission press release dated 05 January 2017 [NPC], part of which reads:
The willful and intentional disregard of his duties as head of agency, which he should know or ought to know, is tantamount to gross negligence A head of agency making his acts depend on the recommendations of the Executive Director or the Information Technology Department amplifies the want of even slight care...
The third ground, meanwhile, has been extensively discussed in the 13 May 2016 article BBM vs Leni: Comelec-Smartmatic gives Sec Abaya a run for his money.

The fourth ground, or betrayal of public trust when Bautista underdeclared his assets, is well-ensconced in the Corona Doctrine, as established when former Chief Justice was removed from office for committing pretty much the same offense.

The fifth ground  bribery through the receipt of commissions from Divina Law  is a bit shaky. I have to see the actual complaint first to see if it has any chance of succeeding.

Hurdling the Lower House
Truth be told, I think that Congress may as well forget about the first, second, third, and fifth ground, as the fourth ground  SALN underdeclaration  is more than enough to convict Bautista. Surely, P 50 million in bank deposits declared in his SALN is way below the P330 million that Bautistas wife Patricia discovered.

And even if Bautista, by some accounting miracle, manages to escape that one, the undeclared real properties are also enough to kick him out.
I have good reason to believe that the impeachment complaint will simply breeze through the House of Representatives. While some camps may argue that the supposed supermajority is mostly composed of political turncoats, we have to remember that a verified impeachment complaint need only gather the signatures of a third of the Lower House.

That is, its pretty easy to get 100 signatures from the 290-or-so congressmen, especially since 121 of these congressmen belong to the administrations PDP-Laban Party. With 100 signatures, an endorsement by the House Justice Committee would be unnecessary, and the articles of impeachment will be automatically transmitted to the Senate for trial.

The question, however, is whether Andy will be convicted in a Senate impeachment trial, or not.

More on that later.

Comelec commissioners react
Several hours after the endorsement of the impeachment complaint, the Comelec Commissioners released a resolution requesting Bautista to file a leave or resign [CNN]. The problem, however, is that Bautista cannot possibly do either.

If Bautista files a leave of absence, the remaining commissioners can do whatever they want without Andys meddling: they can file a resolution that will finally ban Smartmatic from Philippine soil, or give some attention to Nelly Villafuertes 2013 complaint against Leni Robredo, or even conduct an internal investigation on Andy Bautistas corruption and his alleged connivance with Divina Law.

Meanwhile, If Bautista resigns, then he will lose his partial immunity from suit, exposing him to a barrage of graft cases that he will have to battle for the rest of his life.

But like what Ive said in a previous section, the Corona Doctrine virtually ensures impeachment in the Lower House and a conviction in the Senate for Bautista, so it appears that Andy has no way out.

Well, not really.

A Three-pronged Strategy
If I were Andy Bautista, I would use a three-pronged approach as a way out.

First, I will cling onto my Comelec post no matter what.
I will choose to remain Comelec chief until my term ends in February 2022, regardless of the public humiliation thatll come with it. That way, I can maintain  partial immunity from suit and  significant control over the electoral process.

This way, I can temporarily ward off lawsuits as I find ways to sabotage the 2019 and 2022 elections, ensuring the victory of friendly candidates. Most important among these candidates is the next president, who has the power of executive clemency, a power that Andy will really benefit from.

But this wont matter if I get removed from office so

Second, I will ensure acquittal at the Senate Impeachment Trial.
I will probably be impeached in the Lower house, but the Senate impeachment trial is an entirely different ballgame. I can, for example, strike deals with friendly senators in exchange for an acquittal, or I can simply blackmail a few for the same effect.

Senators, however, are political animals. Thus, some of them may resist my charm for fear of losing public support, so

Third, I will minimize public backlash by going on a massive PR spree.
I will spend like theres no tomorrow to improve not only my own image, but also the image of the senators who will side with me. This similar to what I have been doing during these past several weeks, where I have appeared on TV shows left and right, in an attempt to deodorize my stinking reputation. Yes, the last PR spree was a failure because my brother Martin is so stupid [Transcript], but Ill charge that to experience moving forward.

I can also tap on my allies to aid in this effort. Take for example, family friend and former DOTC Usec. Rene Timmy Limcaoco, whose family owns and controls Luzon Development Bank, or the bank where I deposited my presumably ill-gotten wealth. Limcaocos wife Melissa is a co-founder of Hatchd Inc. [CV], one of Rapplers major investors. Thus, I can ask the Limcaocos to force the financially ailing media company to write puff pieces about me or my would-be senator allies.
All three prongs should work for the strategy to succeed, and I honestly think that Andy has the IQ and the US$ to make this work. Now, lets see how the second prong can be implement in the Senate impeachment trial.

Voting at Impeachment Trial
Senator Leila de Lima is detained for drug-related charges and Senator Cayetano has resigned to head the Department of Foreign Affairs, reducing the roster of senators from 24 to 22. Now, a two-thirds majority vote is required for a conviction, so that having 22 senator-judges means 15 convict votes are required, i.e. 8 acquit votes is enough for Andy to avoid impeachment.

The voting patterns will most likely be along party lines, similar to the pattern described in my 18 May 2016 article Mark Villar thwarts LPs Plan B.

Fourteen senators will almost certainly convict Bautista, and they are:
The PDP-Laban Bloc (Ejercito, Pimentel, Zubiri, Pacquiao), or the ruling party.
The Macho Bloc (Sotto, Lacson, Honasan), that owe Bautista nothing and who usually call a spade a spade.
The NPC Bloc (Poe, Legarda, Gatchalian, Gordon, Sotto), that has a standing coalition with PDP-Laban.
Nancy Binay, who hates LPs guts after what LP did to her father Jojo.
Nacionalistas Cynthia Villars son Mark is a Duterte cabinet member, so she probably vote to convict.
Angara is an independent administration ally [GMA].
Hence, I can see only 8 potential senators who can acquit Bautista, and they are:
Sonny Trillanes (Ind)
Franklin Drilon (LP)
Bam Aquino (LP)
Joel Villanueva (CIBAC-LP)
Kiko Pangilinan (LP)
Ralph Recto (LP)
Chiz Escudero (Ind) [FB]
Risa Hontiveros (Akbayan-LP)
Escudero, Villanueva, and Recto may need sweeteners, but I believe that they can be convinced to acquit Bautista.

With 22 senator judges, 14 convict votes and 8 acquit votes, Bautista will remain in the Comelec.

Risa foils Andys Strategy
Andys problem, however, is that Senator Risa Hontiveros may have inadvertently ruined his strategy.

My lawyer-friends and I are confident that prosecutors can easily find probable cause for charges of kidnapping with serious illegal detention against Hontiveros, especially since the parents of not one but BOTH of the underage witnesses are demanding custody of their children.

And what comes after probable cause? A warrant of arrest and unfortunately for Hontiveros, kidnapping with serious illegal detention is a non-bailable offense [People vs Trestiza, G.R. No. 193833] so she cant buy her way out of it.

A conviction is not even necessary at this point: all that's needed is detention without bail.

Thus, a kidnapping with serious illegal detention case, if filed against Hontiveros, will land her a spot in the PNP custodial center, beside incarcerated Senators Estrada, Revilla, and de Lima. And just like de Lima, detention will prevent her from participating in Bautistas impeachment trial.

With Hontiveros down, the total number of senator judges will be reduced from 22 to 21, so that a two-thirds majority will be reduced from 15 to just 14.

But recalling the previous section, we already have 14 senators who will almost certainly vote to convict, right? Yes, Andy may still have seven allies, but with only 21 senator-judges, seven acquit votes are not enough: Andy will still get removed from office.

Senator Risa Hontiveros, thank you for your stupidity. [TP]

The Kidnapper-Senator Risa Hontiveros?,"Senator Risa Hontiveros took custody of the three witnesses  31-year-old and two minors aged 16 and 13 years old  since Sunday (August 20) [MB], without authorization from the minors parents and/or legal guardians.

Some camps argue that Senator Hontiveros and her accomplices may be liable for violating Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, which covers Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention, so lets see if she can indeed be sued for it.

I consulted my lawyer-friends and MyLegalWhiz.com for the preparation of this article.


Risa the Kidnapper?
The elements of the crime of ""Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention"" are [JLP-Law]:
That the offender is a private individual.
That he kidnaps or detains another, or in any other manner deprives the latter of his liberty.
That the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal.
That in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present: 
That the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than five  days; or
That it committed simulating public authority; or
That any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or
That the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.
Element 1: That Risa is a private individual.
Yesterday, PAO Chief Persida Acosta called out Senator Risa Hontiveros for refusing to turn over the underage witnesses, despite the fact that its PAO, along with NBI, DOJ, and PNP, that has the mandate to protect them [GMA].

If the offender is a public officer, the crime committed would be arbitrary detention, but the public officer must have a duty under the law to detain a person. Since senators have no duty to detain or take custody witnesses (only PAO, NBI, DOJ, and PNP has such authority), Senator Hontiveros shall be prosecuted as a private individual.

This fulfills the first element.


Element 2: That Risa kidnaps or detains the minors
The two victims are minors, so parental consent was required before she took custody, i.e. before she limited their liberty. However, in an interview with TV Patrol, one of the minors parents said [FB]:
Actually, hindi ko alam eh. Hindi tama. Yun po yung isang foul din e. Bago po nila kukunin yung anak ko, kunin muna nila yung permiso sa akin kung papayag ba ako na sa kanilang panig ko ibibigay. Unang-una po yang Hontiveros na yan di po, hindi ko po siya nakakausap. Hindi man lang niya hinanap muna kung paano makokontak ang ina ng witness dahil minor po yan eh.

Translation: Actually, I wasnt informed. Thats wrong. Thats foul. Before they take custody of my child, they should asked permission from me, if I will agree to give their side custody of my child. First and foremost is that Hontiveros, I havent spoken to her. She didnt even find a way to contact the mother of the witness despite the witness being a minor. The fact that Risa did not secure consent from the parents means she kidnapped these underage witnesses.

This fulfills the second element.


Element 3: That Risas illegally took custody of the minors
The DOJ is the sole implementor of the Witness Protection Act [RA 6981]. Although the DOJ may call upon other executive agencies to implement the law, whats clear is that the Senate is not an executive agency. That is, the Senate  along with any or all the Senators  have no legal authority to take protective custody of witnesses.
Now, it may be argued that the minors  aged 16 and 13  agreed or even volunteered to be taken into Hontiveros custody. However, parental consent is required in cases like these, something that Hontiveros failed to secure, as shown in the TV Patrol interview cited in the previous section.

Moreover, Hontiveros essentially induced two minors to abandon their homes, thereby violating Article 271 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:
Art. 271. Inducing a minor to abandon his home.  The penalty of prision correccional and a fine not exceeding seven hundred pesos shall be imposed upon anyone who shall induce a minor to abandon the home of his parents or guardians or the persons entrusted with his custody.
Hence, the detention of the minors, even if supposedly protective in nature, is illegal.

This fulfills the third element.

Element 4: Circumstances
Recall that the fourth element is the presence of any of the following circumstances in the commission of the offense:
(a) That the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than five  days; or
(b) That it committed simulating public authority; or
(c) That any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or
(d) That the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.
Hontiveros clearly simulated the authority of PAO, NBI, DOJ, and/or PNP, thereby fulfilling the second condition. Moreover, the persons kidnapped are two minors, fulfilling the fourth condition. Now, the fourth element requires the presence of ANY of the circumstances enumerated, so the presence of (b) and (d) is more than enough.

Suffice it to say, this fulfills the fourth element.

In short, Senator Risa Hontiveros can be sued  and will very likely be convicted  for kidnapping and serious illegal detention of the two minors.

Prison sentences
The overeager Hontiveros, blinded by political ambition, committed kidnapping and serious illegal detention that is punishable by reclusion perpetua [Gov], i.e. 30-year prison term. Note that she took custody of TWO minors, so she may even be found guilty of TWO COUNTS of kidnapping and serious illegal detention, translating to up to 60 years in prison.

Hontiveros also violated Article 271 or inducing minors to abandon their home, where the penalty is imprisonment ranging from six months to six years. Again, she may be guilty of TWO counts.

Hontiveros also committed Obstruction of Justice [P.D. 1829], as she prevented witnesses from reporting the commission of any offense or the identity of any offender/s by means of force, in light of her having kidnapped the underage witnesses and PAO Chief Acosta having to call her out for refusing to turn over the same. Again, she may be guilty of TWO (or even up to three) counts. The penalty is imprisonment ranging from six months to six years per count.

(30+30) + (6+6) + (6+6+6) = 90

With these said, Hontiveros faces the prospect of having to stay for up to 90 years behind bars.
Who can sue?
For Obstruction of Justice, the DOJ, PAO, NBI, or PNP can sue her. 

As for  kidnapping serious illegal detention and  inducing a minor to abandon his home, any parent or household member can sue Senator Hontiveros. However, anybody who has personal knowledge of the commission of the offense may also file a case. Since Hontiveros was stupid enough to broadcast her deeds on national TV, everyone can be presumed to have personal knowledge, i.e. VIRTUALLY ANYONE CAN SUE HER.

Moreover, since the two witnesses are minors and no legal guardian has come forward, the concept of parens patriae (parent of the nation) applies.

In Nery vs. Lorenzo, [G.R. No. L-23096, G.R. No. L-23376]:
Concerning the protection of minors, the State's role as parens patriae burdens it with the duty of protecting the rights of persons or individual who because of age or incapacity are in an unfavorable position, vis-a-vis other parties. Unable as they are to take due care of what concerns them, they have the political community to look after their welfare.
Moreover, in Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Del Monte Piedad [G.R. No. L-9959]:
The prerogative of parens patriae is inherent in the supreme power of every State and is often necessary to be exercised in the interest of humanity and for the prevention of injury to those who cannot protect themselves.
That is, should a parent or household member of the underage witnesses fail to file a case, the Department of Justice (DoJ) or even the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), can file a case instead, a case that is very likely to send the overeager Senator to jail.

Note that I have notified the DSWD of this issue and they're looking into the matter right now.

To cut the long story short, Senator Risa Hontiveros is in big trouble. And did I say reclusion perpetua may also include perpetual disqualification from public office? [TP]

TRANSCRIPT: Q and A with Comelec chair's brother Martin Bautista,"A couple of weeks ago, Comelec chair Andres ""Andy"" Bautista's wife, Patricia ""Tisha"" Bautista, revealed to the public pieces of evidence that strongly suggest that the husbad amassed ill-gotten wealth during his stint in the government. 

In defense of his brother Andy, Martin Bautista, a practicing gastroenterologist in the United States, came out several days after the revelation, claiming that much of Andy's alleged wealth came from him. Martin has since appeared in several shows, and he decided to reach out to social media bloggers and newspaper columnists by granting an interview.

The interview turned out to be some sort of town hall meeting, with Martin as the interviewee and the following as the interviewers:
Manila Times columnist and former Ambassador Rigoberto Tiglao
Manila Standard columnist Jojo Robles
DLSU Political Science Professor Antonio Contreras
Atty. Trixie Cruz-Angeles
Atty. Ahmed Paglinawan
Krizette Chu
Dr. Ethel Pineda
RJ Nieto (me)
Atty. Bruce Rivera, et. Al.
Bautista was barraged by questions from the interviewers and I have rearranged the contents of the actual conversation into a question-and-answer format to make it more readable. I have removed the names of the persons who asked the questions for brevity.

Here we go.

The Interview
Q1: What is your immigration status in the US right now? Are you a US citizen and if so, are you a dual citizen?
A: (Ive been a) permanent resident since 1996.
Q: Did you state your US resident status in your certificate of candidacy?
A: I would have surrendered it had I won.
Q: So you declared residency even without surrendering your green card?
A: I had returned to the Philippines permanently in 2006.
Q: But did not surrender your green card?
A: No.

Bautista ran for Senator in 2007 under the ""Ang Kapatiran"" Party, and in 2010 under the Liberal Party. He lost on both occasions.

Q: To your knowledge, do u have a joint bank account with your brother in any bank in the Philippines?
A: Yes. Since I couldn't sign for some of the accounts, my sister or my mother signed for me.
Q: So you issued them an SPA (Special Power of Attorney)?
A: Yes
Q: How much was in the account?
A: We are working with a forensic accountant. (We) hired her yesterday.
Q: Did your name appear in the accounts as a co-depositor and how much was in the account?
A: I will check. After 2014, I did not have the opportunity to personally open accounts.
Q: To your knowledge do you own an account in Luzon Development bank, singly or as a co-depositor?
A: I inquired yesterday. I know I opened accounts in 2009. I will inform you as soon as I receive word. Always as a co-depositor.
Q: Why are you only asking now?
A: Because the LDB passbooks were taken without my brother's knowledge last November.
Q: You deposited in 2009 but are not aware of the status or amount. Is it fair to say that the controversy moved you to ask?
A: Especially after my brother entered government service in 2010, I don't remember inquiring, a reflection of my absolute trust in my brother.
Q: But surely you would know the initial amount?
A: 1.7 million dollars in 2000 8 million pesos in 2000 Before they got married.
Q: May I ask the next question: Why did you choose to open accounts--with big amounts--in LDB? Apart from the owner being your friend, were you not worried about stability, as well as products and services?
A: 1993-2010 investments were for growth, 2010-present primarily for stability and security.
Q: LDB is not stable nor established, relative to other banks Not stability on your end. But the bank itself. To be honest, many of us have never heard of the bank before this ""expose."" So many are asking why choose LDB?
A: Stability is relative, Krizette, compared to BDO for example, we didn't know the owners. I am inviting Darwin [Caete] later today or tomorrow to personally view my cash deposits in the US and he will vouch that relative to my investments in our country, these are pretty small. Hindi naman po sa nagyayabang. Please consider my invitation to personally look at my US cash holdings so you can understand my level of interest with my Philippine investments.
Q: What do your friends the Limcaocos say about this and the role of their bank in the issue?
A: [No Answer]
Q: Ok, so the amounts divulged by your sister in law are small, relative to your US holdings, which explains your lack of interest in them. I hope I got that right. But when your brother joined government, did it not occur to you and your family that you should no longer be using him anymore as a depository of your funds, for his own protection?
A: (The) reason why he parked the funds in money market accounts under a trust so that he could minimally supervise the funds.
Q: But what about the SALN implications, especially post-Corona? was this discussed when he joined government?
A: I ask for your patience, the NBI will vouch for all the transactions that occurred before and after he joined government. Jojo, I didn't discuss SALN with my brother.
Q: So, basically, the position taken by the family was: let Andy handle it?
A: Yes.
Q: Why are you here? did you come on your own accord or did Andy ask you to come?
A: I am here on my own accord. I have 5 daughters in the US, school is opening this week and my pulmonologist wife is alone,holding the fort, but she understands that the honor of our family is at stake.
Q: You said you left practically everything to Andy. Can you categorically say that the monies deposited in the accounts are all sourced from family?
A: Yes.
Q: How can you be so sure? Did he give u regular updates on amounts and transactions, dates You said you practically let him manage them.
A: As I said, after 2010, I don't recall any updates. He rolled them over and over.
Q: So you wouldnt have data about recent deposits? Like in 2016, for example?
A: Data, in the form of redeemed coupons, bonds, expired passbooks will prove the source of all the funds.
Q: But I am asking you Sir. Are you informed?
A: Not in 2016, Sir.
Q: You said Andy rolled over the deposits. Did he ask your permission? If so, did you give him permission?
A: I have complete faith and trust in my brother. I allowed him to fully manage my funds in the Philippines.
Q: Why did you think itd be a good idea to reveal that the Bautistas have money with Andy that Andy STILL did not declare in his SALN?
A: I truly appreciate this opportunity and would like once again to invite all of you for a personal meeting. The SALN of my brother is factually accurate, ""no perfect SALN"" but very close to the real figure. Iba talaga kung tayo'y magkita.
Q: What are your sources of income sir?
A: Clinic established in 1998, with an endoscopy suite, X-ray, MRI, CT, treadmill, etc plus a pharmacy. See 120-150 patients daily. I am not worried about the IRS, for the past 6 years, my wife and I have been the biggest taxpayers of Texas County, OK. Please don't misconstrue my comments as mayabang.
A Google Streetview of the Specialty Clinics of St. Anne,  an outpatient clinic owned by Bautista, where he employs 4 other Filipino doctors,

Q: How much of your US income is represented by your personal wealth here in the Philippines?
A: Again, let me defer to the figures from the forensic investigation.
Q: So there are others sources of the money with Andy which did not come from the US?
A: My money invested with Andy all came from the US. Remember, my parents are also investors, their funds are from the Philippines.
Q: But hypothetically, you file income tax with the US. Why would you not know it for purposes of filing income tax?
A: Yes, they withhold tax on interest income.
Q: Then there should be paper trail to be able to prove it.
A: Of course.
Q: Are you completely debt free in the US, Sir? No mortgages, loans, and educational loans for the children?
A: Completely without liabilities.
Q: Yes but expenses?
A: We managed to completely pay off our clinic in 10 months in 2001. Total income of $6.5 million less expenses. Audited by the IRS in 2009. No deficiencies.
Q: Your clinic is located where? Oklahoma, right?
A: We are in the Oklahoma panhandle, no HMO, no Medicaid.
Q: Do you employ doctors and nurses? Do you do homecare? It is a rehabilitation facility?
A: 23 employees, 4 doctors (all from UP PGH), 6 nurses, 3 lab techs, reception and billing. Pure outpatient, no rehabilitation.
Q: Is your wife a us citizen?
A: Yes.
Q: No specializations?
A: Gastroenterology and pulmonary medicine Key to success is location of the clinic, fee for service, rare in the US. My wife and I are the only liberals in the reddest of states. She can vote, I can't.
Q: Do you have fellowship on these areas?
A: My wife and I do. Both associates are board certified in family practice.
Q: Have you, your brother or your family really engaged a PR company's services, to counter the bad publicity, as far as you know?
A: No! I came home also because my brother was doing all the work aside from his Comelec duties, only yesterday did we ask some professionals to help, exceedingly lean next to Tish's.
Q: You said you invested $1.3m here in 2000?
A: $1.7m
Q: Did you add to that later?
A: Yes
Q: (How did you send money to the Philippines?)
A: Wire transfers
Q: In how many increments?
A: Bi annually
Q: Twice only?
A: 1996-2009. Sometimes once a year.
Q: To whom did you wire transfer the money, to Andy?
A: To Andy. Before they got married, everything was clearly demarcated.
Q: You earlier said you invested 1.7m in dollars in the year 2000, but you also sent money before and after that?

A: Current amount to date in 2000 was 1.7, my apologies.
Q: And there was more after 2000?
A: Yes.
Q: How much were these increments?
A: I will provide the breakdown from the accountant.
Q: The total amount remitted in the period you mentioned is more than 1.7?
A: 1.7 was the amount to date in 2000.
Q: How much did you remit in all?
A: More, will get back with you.
Q: When did you invest in Forex?
A: I did not.
Q: Out of the funds in Andy's accounts in Luzon Bank, RCBC, and HSBC how much of these were HIS funds, and can he show proof these are his. I know he is very very rich that he doesn't know the exact figures of his money, but can he give as a ball-park figure?
A: 1.7 represented the year to date investment I had with him before he got married, Patricia acknowledges this fact. He got married in 2000, my wife and I continued to invest with him.
Q: I admire your trust in your brother. You must be super-rich not to ask for some documentation from him that the money is ours, -- in case knock on wood -- something happens to you and your wife, and your children ask to get back the funds.
A: Documentation ground to a halt in late 2009, before he worked for the government. I have no knowledge regarding the pyramid scheme and modesty aside, my Philippine investments represent a small fraction of my total holdings, which I can easily prove as well.
Q: (Conjugal property rights)?
A: Andy made the demarcations between the amounts clear so Tisha would have been entitled to her rightful share. Then again, among 63 first cousins (Donato and Bautista sides) we have had only 2 divorces.
Q: So no documentation, no proof, at all that you really own P1.7M or P77m of Andy's P330m investments in LDB et al? We will just believe you since $1.7M is just change for you? So let me be clear Martin. You say the P77M in Andy's accounts are yours. Are these still there, or did you get it back? But there is no documentation. Everything is in Andy's name?
A: Redeemed bonds and time deposits will show where the funds he had been rolling over originated.
Q: Please explain, walk me through this please. My interest at this point is what happened to your money.

A: From the 1.7 million in 2000, my investments continued to grow with more remittances. The accumulated amount will form the root of the rolled over funds.
Q: If the 120-150 patients a day in your clinic, all of them are yours or us that the total number of patients? There are two other family med consultants, right? Is it accurate to say they see more patients?
A: I used to see the majority but with my advancing age, I now see 30 every morning, I play golf in the afternoon with my wife.
Q: ""From the 1.7 million in 2000, my investments continued to grow with more remittances"" So how much is your total money worth?
A: We have a forensic accountant determining those amounts We retained the services of an accountant yesterday. You will be receiving exact amounts.
Q: I just want to be absolutely clear: You gave Andy $1.7 M to put int his LDB accounts. But you can't prove this. This amount has grown with additional remittances from you and with Andy investing it in bonds and time deposits. But all these you can't prove as you're waiting for forensic accountant's report. Do you have any idea or just all park-figure how much your $1.7 M has grown. Has it grown to explain all of Andy's P300 m many in LDB?
A: Our counsel advised us to let the NBI have the first look, hope you understand Yes, my investments will cover the difference and the forensic research will validate this My parents have also been entrusting their nest eggs with Andy, don't forget.
Q: I see you have a very large share of patients in your area. A population of 21,000 with your clinic getting 150 patients a day.
A: Our town has a meat packing plant that employs a great number of Hispanics. We are the clinic that speaks Spanish.
Q: I hate to be repetitive, how much ball park figures or percentage lang would account for the P327 million in Andy's account. Let's leave your parents or in laws out of the question muna.
A: We were assured it would take 2 weeks max, I want to give you exact numbers.
Q: You mean your $1.7 m in Andy's account just a fraction of your wealth, that you didn't really care about it, as proven by your home? Saan ba home mo? Last question, promise: is the condo in The District in San francisco yours or Andy's?
A: Copy of my deposits are in my house in New Manila, SFO condo is owned by my sister.
Q: Aside from the $1.7m and P8m you gave Andy, have you given him anything else?

A: 1.7 from 1993-2000. 2000 to 2009, to be determined.
Q: Can you at least give us a ballpark figure of the total remittances from 00 to 09?
A: Can we wait for the accountant to come up with an exact figure?
Q: E baka he's trying to determine pa a formula to generate P300 million out of P77 million in ten years.
A: I will present you proof that my Philippine holdings represent but a fraction of my US holdings, nothing far fetched.
Q: Andy said you guys ran a ""forex"" investment ops that works similar to a ""pyramid scheme"". Was it done through a company and if so, what's the the name of that company? If not, can you elaborate a bit more on how that works? Forex trading sans insider info offers minimal profit margins.
A: RJ, I don't know enough about the Forex angle, just arrived Saturday night. My brother mentioned it during his interview with Karen Davila.
Q: Martin, do u categorically say that you have no idea about the total amount you've sent to Andy? I mean, not just the 1.7 + 8, but the total. Even a figure rounded to the nearest ten million pesos or million dollars?
A: At least 250 million pesos without any interest/investment income.
Q: Got it. What was the source of the approx 250? Pls give me an estimate nung fraction na from your own money.
A: 1/4 of my cash deposits.
Q: So 25% of the 250 is yours?
A: No, I have about 1 billion pesos cash in the US.
Q: Andy has been a finance lawyer in as early as 1993, so why wasn't he holding the money earlier?
A: He started working as a New York lawyer in '93 Some of them, remember Andy did the transfers.
Q: how much do u earn per annum in your practice in Guymon?
A: $3 million last year.
Q: Andy has PoA over your own accounts?
A: Yes.
Q: If Andy has PoA, what made u guys decide that PoA is not enough and you had to transfer the money to him totally?
A: He had total and complete control of our investments, he could not have transferred my funds in the US on his own.
Q: You said that your hospital serviced a factory whose workers are mainly Hispanics. And you took note of the fact that you are the only Spanish speaking hospital in the area. Is that correct?
A: Seaboard Farms in Guymon, Oklahoma. 4000 employees.
Q: You also said that your hospital does not cater to patients with HMO and Medicaid?
A: My clinic, not the county hospital. County is mandated to accept indigent patients.
Q: But I am talking about your clinic.
A: Factory insurance is deemed Cadillac insurance in the US My clinic doesn't take Medicaid.
Q: So you must be takin in so many paying private patients for you to earn a lot? In a county whose media income is below the US average?
A: Yes, ang laki na nga ang bawas during Obamacare.

Notes
There was supposed to be a continuation of the interview the day after this, but it didn't materialize.
Bautista promised to send us copies of the financial documents, but we have yet to receive them.

Comelec and DOTC Corruption: Wife's expos breeds another expos?,"Ah, Tisha! Thank you!
Patricia Tisha Bautista, wife of COMELEC chair Andres Andy Bautista, executed a sworn affidavit accusing the husband of so many things, I dont even know where to start. To make the explanation simpler, let me list down the basic allegations one by one [CNN].
That Andy amassed hundreds of millions of pesos worth of bank deposits in 38 accounts, most of which are undeclared in his SALN.
That Andy has real estate, some of which are undeclared in his SALN.
That Andy engaged in influence peddling within the Comelec in exchange for commissions from Andys supposed beneficiary, the Divina Law Firm.
To back her accusations, Tisha provided Andy passbooks and other financial documents.

""The substantial deposits and withdrawals in each of the accounts were made within the last two years, and coincidentally, while Andy was already the COMELEC Chairman and when the 2016 National and Local Elections were conducted, Patricia said in the affidavit.

Yeah, by the looks of it, Andy is dead meat.

But before I expound on the allegations, I think that, as a side story, I should discuss the issue of admissibility of evidence, and thanks to MyLegalWhiz for the legal resources.

Spousal Privilege
You see, spouses cannot just testify against each other, because according to Section 24(a), Rule 130, of the Rules of Court covering Spousal Privilege:
The husband or the wife, during or after the marriage, cannot be examined without the consent of the other as to any communication received in confidence by one from the other during the marriage
That is, should Andy be tried for, say, graft, he can petition the courts to declare Tishas evidence and testimony inadmissible, as Tisha is still married to Andy and spousal privilege applies.

Now, the prosecution can argue that Tishas evidence is an exception per Alvarez vs Ramirez [SC G.R. No. 143439]:
Where the marital and domestic relations are so strained that there is no more harmony to be preserved nor peace and tranquility which may be disturbed, the reason based upon such harmony and tranquility fails.
However, the defense can argue that the existence of such a level of strain is still under debate. Tisha has been wanting to be legally separated from Any in as early as 2013, but the fact remains that both still live under one roof.

Yes, theres a pretty good chance that the documents Tisha provided are inadmissible in court, should a graft charge be filed against Andy.

But

But, and a big BUT
Theres a loophole. The same Rule on Spousal Privilege also provides an exception. Quoting the last half of the same rule:
[Spousal Privilege holds] except in a civil case by one against the other, or in a criminal case for a crime committed by one against the other or the latter's direct descendants or ascendants.
Tisha can testify against Andy and submit the financial documents if the case is Tisha vs Andy, and thats where the last part of Tishas affidavit comes in.
On page nine of her affidavit, Tisha accused Andy of abandoning his financial responsibilities to family, which prompted Tisha to file a case of Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC) in Taguig City against Andy for the emotional and economic sabotage that he is performing against [Tisha] and [her] family.

That is, Tisha can present the evidence shown in yesterdays press conference as proof of Andys financial capability, and she can also testify against Andy if the need arises. After all, the VAWC case is Tisha vs Andy, which qualifies as an exception to the Rule on Spousal Privilege.

Now, you may ask: how can this VAWC case be relevant to crimes Andy supposedly committed in the Comelec?

Well, testimonies and evidence provided in court proceedings become public record after cross-examination. That is, government prosecutors for a prospective graft case vs Andy may use whatever Tisha will say and show during the VAWC hearings.
In short, the passbooks, financial records, and testimonies, if introduced in this manner, will be perfectly admissible as evidence in court.

Yeah, Andy is toast if the documents turn out to be authentic.

But wait! Were not done yet.

Now that we got the admissibility issue out of the way, theres something else, something more important, that I have to let you know.

Andy, LDB and AMLC Red Flags
Andys controversial bank accounts are mostly with a certain Luzon Development Bank (LDB), with the 35 LDB passbookss deposits totaling P329 million, or about twice as much as the Andys net worth in his latest SALN [GMA].

Judging from the evidence Tisha provided, its interesting to note the following:

First, so many bank accounts for just one person?
The US Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils lists this as a money laundering red flag [FFIEC], i.e. when a customer maintains multiple accounts at a bank for no apparent legitimate reason.

Second, a deliberate attempt to evade AMLCs radar?
Tisha also noted in the affidavit that the deposits to the accounts are hefty, but are less than P500,000 each. Only deposits worth P500,000 are automatically reported to the Anti-Money Laundering Council [GMA]. Yes, the numerous deposits evaded AMLCs radar.

Third, why so much money in such a small bank?
LDB is a pretty small bank, holding only P4 billion, P3 billion, and P2 billion in deposits as of 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively [LDB]. Thus, depositing P329 million  a large amount in relation to the banks size  seems to be an unnecessarily risky bet. After all, there are lots of other bigger banks that are better equipped at handling such an amount.

Prospective money launderers find it advantageous to keep money in smaller banks because these are not usually subjected to the same stringent standards that the AMLC imposes on big banks like BDO, UnionBank, and BPI.

Small banks are being targeted by launderers, terrorist and other criminals because of their inexperience and lack of technology and processes to handle sophisticated laundering scenarios [AutoAML].

And heres where it gets more interesting.

Andres Bautista, the world class finance lawyer
Andy Bautista is not a stranger in banking and finance, as his resume lists banking and finance related positions left and right. According to his [LinkedIn] account, he was:
Senior Associate at White & Case LLP from 93 - 00, with his practice involving general corporate law with a specialization in project finance, mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructurings and joint venture and cross border transactions.
Country Head at Allen & Overy HK from 01 - 06, providing legal consulting services in all aspects of international corporate, capital markets and infrastructure financings.
Chairman of PCGG from 10  15, tasked to recover Marcos ill-gotten wealth and recommend measures to curb graft and corruption.
Yes, Andres Bautista is a world class finance lawyer, and with his over two decades of world class experience, he knows the ins and outs of money laundering like the back of his hand. Now, add the fact that the LDB accounts have already raised three red flags.
That is, if I will choose someone who will launder my money, Id probably choose Andres Bautista.

Now, evidence at hand suggests that Andy might indeed be laundering ill-gotten wealth, but there are two burning questions that still need to be addressed:
There are many small banks, so why did Andy specifically choose LDB?
There arent a lot of big-ticket election cases filed in the Comelec, so how can Andys passbooks contain such an astronomical amount?
LDBs ownership provides a clue.


What is Luzon Development Bank?
Laguna-based community bank LDB was founded in 1961 by the Limcaoco Family [LDB] and it has about 40 branches today. Yes, its larger than a rural bank, but a lot smaller than the major banks that most of us are familiar with.

LDB is a subsidiary of the Lica Group [Lica], also controlled by the Limcaoco Family, with Rene Timmy Limcaoco as one of its managing directors [Old Swiss Inn]. Its the same Timmy Limcaoco who was Aquinos DOTC Undersecretary of Planning and Infrastructure Projects.

Limcaoco was appointed DOTC Usec in 2011 upon the recommendation of then DoTC Secretary Mar Roxas. Describing Limcaoco as a successful businessman, Roxas tasked him to handle DoTCs Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and greenfield projects sector [Inq].

Greenfield projects mean projects that start from scratch. Meanwhile, we all know what PPPs are, and we all know that the Aquino governments analysis paralysis made PPPs almost impossible. Abaya retained Limcaoco when he took over DOTC, and that says something about how influential this Limcaoco is.

But heres the fun part: Limcaoco was embroiled in so many controversies during his term in DOTC.

Lets list some of them.

Usec. Limcaocos scandals
2013: US$ 30 million extortion try
In October 2013, Czech train supplier Inekon CEO Josef Husek mentioned Timmy Limcaocos name in his affidavit accusing the DOTC of extorting US$30 million from his company in exchange for winning an MRT supply contract.

On 9 July 2012, upon our arrival in Manila, Czech Ambassador Josef Rychtar presented the business schedule. It included meetings with DOTC Usec Rene Limcaoco and MRT general manager Al Vitangcol the following day, Husek said [Star].

2014: The LRT 1 extension that never happened
Remember when Aquino promised that he, along with DOTC Sec. Abaya, would have themselves run over by a train if the LRT-1 extension is not completed? Well, Limcaoco handled that non-project [Star]. As it turns out, Timmy Limcaoco is a sibling of a senior Ayala Corporation executive, and Ayala is the LONE BIDDER in the project [ABS].

O di ba!?

2013: The faulty Dalian trains
The Dalian trains that Abayas DOTC procured in 2013 turned out to be unusable for so many reasons, and I wont expound on that anymore. Whats important in this article, however, is the confirmation that Dalian agreed to give a 5 percent kickback to Abaya and other DOTC officials for approving the contract.

The DOTC bids and awards committee  of which Limcaoco is part  disqualified Dalians rival over a minor technicality, then awarded the P3.75-billion to Dalian. That translates to around P187 million in kickbacks [Star].


Andy and Timmy
Now, you probably ask, so what does Andy Bautista have to do with all these?

At this point, its clear that:
Andy has too much money.
Andy has too many bank accounts.
Andy chose LDB.
Timmys family owns LDB.
Timmy is part of Abayas corrupt DOTC.
Now, how do we connect Andy and Timmy ?

In a press conference, Bautista said he keeps so much money in LDB because he knows the owners and trusts them. What Andy didnt mention, however, is how well he knows the Limcaocos.

Manila Standard columnist Jojo Robles explained the link very well. 

In his column yesterday, Robles explained that Andy and Timmy are bosom buddies in the Ateneo de Manila High School section 4-A. Meanwhile, Andys brother was classmates with Timmys brother TG Limcaoco.

Yeah, Andy and Timmy are childhood friends. Even their respective brothers are also childhood friends. So yes, there must be considerable level trust between Andy and Timmy. After all, they REALLY know each other.

Ohhhhhh, this is fun!

Burning Questions
On one hand, we have a Timmy who may be handling tens (or even hundreds) of millions worth of dirty money from DOTC-era kickbacks and needs someone to successfully launder his money. On the other, we have a friend of Timmys who happens to be a world class financial lawyer, and who supposedly also needs a bank where he can launder money of his own.

Aint that pretty?

So, lets ask:

First, when Andy Bautista said that not all of the money in those 35 passbooks are his, did he mean they belong to Timmy Limcaoco, who may have gotten it from the Aquino-era DOTC kickbacks?

Second, is it possible that, in exchange for laundering Timmy s dirty money, Andy will be allowed to launder his dirty Comelec money in Timmys own bank?

Third, Tisha discovered 35 passbooks, so is Andres hiding more money in other bank accounts that Tisha (or the public) has yet to discover?

Fourth, is Limcaocos money purely composed of his, or was he tasked with laundering the share of other DOTC officials like Roxas, Abaya, and Vitangcol?

Fifth, Roxas family  the Aranetas  own shares in major banks, but laundering money in big banks is tough, so is it possible that the Aquino-era DOTC officials entrusted the laundering of their share of the loot to Limcaoco, who owns the smaller bank?

And most importantly, did Tisha unwittingly discover part of Roxas 2016 election war chest?

Ah, this is just too juicy!

Too Speculative?
Some may be inclined to dismiss the previous questions as too speculative. But Central Bank data supports them.

Earlier today, I noticed that the Andys LDB bank accounts are almost numbered consecutively, suggesting that LDB doesnt have a lot of depositors.
Andy's alleged LDB accounts.
Despite this, LDB experienced massive growth in deposits. 

Here is a table showing LDBs deposit liabilities, according to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas database of Balance Sheets/Statements of Condition for Thrift Banks [BSP]. I also included a third column, which shows year-on-year growth of deposit liabilities.


Sources: LDB Docs from 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017.

Now, heres a chart that illustrates the deposit figures in the table above:


Now, heres a chart that illustrates the year-on-year growth rate of deposits:


With these, we can see that the growth of LBDs deposit liabilities was slowing down from 2006 to 2011, then it picked up and massively accelerated from 2011 to 2014, then decelerated again from 2014 to 2017.

By the way, 2015-2016 was the Election Season, remember? Hehehe.

The rapid growth of deposits 2012 to 2014 boosted LDBs deposit liabilities from just P1.9 billion in 2010 to P4.79 billion in 2016, or by about 152%.

Do you see it now?

LDB appears to not be enjoying drastic growth in the number of depositors, yet it enjoyed massive growth in the total amount of deposits. Moreover, most of the growth happened from 2012 to 2014. Now, the scandals involving Timmy Limcaoco and the DOTC happened in 2013 and 2014.

Did Andy team up with Timmy and Abayas DOTC on a joint laundry business?

Customs vs Lower House: Ang Chika sa Bebot vs Mandy Saga,"Parang kailangan atang may sibakin. Hulaan mo kung sino.

Ang gulo-gulo na ng hidwaan ng Lower House at Bureau of Customs. Based sa mga balita, nag-umpisa ito bilang congressional investigation tungkol sa P6.4 billion na shabu na nakalusot sa pantalan. Tapos, imbes na shabu ang issue, biglang natutok ang galit ng kongreso kay Atty. Mandy Anderson, ang chief of staff ni Faeldon.

Bonggang-bonggang word war ang naganap, at wala akong pinanigan dahil sa totoo lang, hindi ako ganoon ka-interesado sa mga catfights. Pero imbes na magsawa si Speaker Alvarez at Anderson, ni-level up ni Anderson ang away nang paratangan nitong nag-i-influence peddling si Bebot.

Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

Dalawang linggo nang araw-araw na may hearing sa kongreso, at nabalitaan ko na nagbabalak nang mag-resign ang ilang deputy commissioner ng Customs dahil wala na silang magawa kundi dumalo at mapahiya sa mga hearing. Marami pa akong ibang narinig, pero di ko na babanggitin dahil ayoko nang dumagdag pa sa gulo.

Pero kailangang may gawin ako, dahil sa totoo lang, kahit hindi perpekto si Faeldon at kahit hindi perpekto si Bebot, aaminin kong walang mainam na kapalit sa kanilang mga puwesto ang bawat isa. And at the rate things are going, mukhang mutually assured destruction ang aabutin ng dalawang to.

E ang problema kasi diyan, sakit yan ng ulo para kay Duterte at para sa bayan, at ayoko ng sakit ng ulo.

Dahil diyan, kinausap ko ang mga kakilala ko sa Customs, sa House of Representatives, sa Senado, sa Malacanang, at pati sa pribadong sektor, para mapagbulay-bulay ko ang issue na ito, na may layuning mahanap ang punot dulo ng problema.

Tara.

Ang Rekomendasyon ni Speaker Alvarez
Ayon sa mga sources ko sa customs, nag-umpisa yan sa recommendation letter na ipinadala ni Speaker Alvarez sa opisina ni Customs chief Faeldon. Mayroon kasing gustong ipasok si Alvarez, si Sandy Sacluti. Ang problema, ni-reject ni Faeldon Chief of Staff Atty. Mandy Anderson ang application ni Sacluti. Tahasang sinabi ni attorney na hindi raw qualified si Anderson.

Ayon sa mga sources ko sa House of Representatives, ipinatawag ni Speaker Alvarez si Anderson para makausap sa isang closed-door meeting. Imbes raw na magpaliwanag ng maayos kung bakit niya ni-reject ang application, maangas na sumagot ang Anderson, na tipong may ere na How dare you question my judgment?! In short, palaban daw si Ateng imbes na kalmado sa pagpapaliwanag.


At dahil rito, uminit ang dugo ng mga taga-House kay Anderson. Ibang level ang arrive ni atcheng e: mayabang at bastos raw. So sa mismong closed-door meeting, binungangaan daw ni Bebot si Anderson.
Basically, nagtanim ng sama ng loob si Alvarez dahil sa kaangasan ni Anderson. Di ko naman masisisi ang lolo mo dahil may kaangasan nga rin talaga si atorni.

In fairness naman kay Anderson, tinakot daw siya ni Alvarez, through an assistant, kung hindi niya ipopromote si Sacluti.

Pero wait lang, bakit si Anderson ang kausap ni Bebot, e Chief of Staff lang siya?
Mandy Mini-Faeldon Anderson
Ayon sa mga Customs sources, makapangyarihan at impluwensiyal daw si Anderson sa BoC, kapangyahiran at impluwensiyang tila lagpas sa dapat na ine-exercise ng isang Chief of Staff lang. Let us cite a few examples:

UNA, ANG MCLE
Ang mga abogado ay sumasailalim sa Mandatory Continuing Legal Education regularly, at pinasya raw ni Anderson na ganapin ang MCLE ng mga customs lawyers sa customs mismo. Hindi naman ito illegal, pero hindi rin ito karaniwan. Ang masaklap nga lang, may mga customs lawyers na hindi isinali sa MCLE sa customs dahil hindi raw kasundo ni Anderson.

PANGALAWA, OVERSIGHT SA LEGAL 
Si Anderson din daw ang naatasang taga-evaluate ng mga output ng Customs legal department, imbes sa kung sino man ang chief legal counsel ng BoC. Again, siya ang gumagawa kahit Chief of Staff lang, at kahit wala pang dalawang taon nang makapasa sa bar exams.

May gatas pa sa labi si ate, pero binigyan siya ng ganitong kabigat na trabaho. Siya rin kaya ang dahilan kung bakit may bagong pahirap na panuntunan tungkol sa mga balikbayan boxes?

Sa totoo lang, mga 'teh, si Mandy ang unqualified para sa oversight sa legal stuff ng customs. INEXPERIENCED pa siya masyado.

PANGATLO, HIRING AND PROMOTION
Si Anderson din daw ang may hawak ng decisions relating to hiring and promotion, at kasama sa mga na-boljak ni Anderson ay si Pedro, yung aplikanteng nirekomenda ni Bebot.

In short, tila daig pa ni Anderson ang mga Deputy Commissioner ng customs pagdating sa decision-making. Ang problema, mas mataas dapat ang mga deputy commissioner kaysa kay Anderson.
Yup, parang may mali na nga. Ayon sa mga Customs sources ko, dine-derive daw ni Anderson ang kanyang epic na lakas ng loob dahil kumpiyansa siyang kakampihan niya si Faeldon.

But wait, theres more!

Rumesbak si Anderson sa panggigisa ni Bebot nang sabihin nito sa Facebook na Im hoping and praying he tries so he realizes what an imbecile he is when he fails. Isnt there anyone else in the House composed of 200+ representatives who can actually be Speaker? Nakakahiya na!, bilang reaksyon sa isang earlier statement ni Bebot tungkol sa pagbuwag ng isang dibisyon ng Court of Appeals.

Yeah, war kung war na ito pero in fairness, tahimik naman si Alvarez after that.

P6.4 billion shabu shipment
Several weeks later, may lumusot na P6.4 billion na shabu sa Port of Manila, at ito ang paksa ng ongoing na congressional investigation. Noong unang araw ng hearing, naupo ang mga opisyal ng customs sa resource panel sa Lower House para mag-testify, at laking gulat ng mga kongresista nang maupo si Anderson kasama ang mga Customs officials, kahit staffer lang si Anderson.

E eto nga ang problema: di ba ngat mainit ang dugo ng mga kongresista kay Anderson?

So imbes na hearing sa shabu, naging hearing tungkol sa Facebook Post ni Anderson. Nakakaloka. Ginisa ni House Majority Leader Farinas si Anderson dahil sa post na yon, hanggang paratangan na ng ilang mga kongresista ang Customs na nagco-coverup ng incompetence, i.e. ipinapain si Anderson para mawaglit ang atensyon sa nakalusot na shabu.

Dumepensa si Anderson nang sagutin niya si Farias ng These are libelous and preposterous imputations and allegations which are not backed by a single iota of evidence.

Si ate, medyo shunga. Walang libel sa congressional hearings. Anyway....

Hindi na nag-komento si Alvarez tungkol rito.

Lumala pa nang lumala
So far, eto ang mga malinaw na nangyari:
Nag-endorso ng tao si Bebot sa Customs, at ni-reject ito ni Anderson with matching fireworks.
Kinausap ni Bebot si Anderson with matching sermon dahil bastos ang pagkapaliwanag raw, at sumagot rin naman daw si Anderson nang pabalang.
Binanatan ni Anderson si Bebot, calling the latter an imbecile sa Facebook.
Nag-umpisa ang investigation sa shabu shipment, at natuon ang atensiyon kay Anderson dahil nagpabida ito sa hearing.
Ginatungan ni Farias ang samaan ng loob ni Bebot at Mandy, at tahasang ginisa si Mandy sa hearing.
Pinaratangan ni Mandy si Farias ng libel dahil raw walang ebidensiya ang paratang ni Farias kay atcheng.
Akala mo tapos na? HINDI PA!

Bumuwelta uli si Anderson nang mag-post ito sa Facebook ng free speech daw. Actually, gumawa pa siya ng sarili niyang page entitled Atty. Mandy Anderson, CPA. TARAY!

Well, kung fighting spirit lang rin ang labanan, llamado si Mandy.

Manipis lang ba si Bebot?
Inclined ako na maniwalang baka pinagpipilitan ni Bebot na ipasok talaga yung manok niya sa Customs. Kaya lang, may similar na sitwasyon kasing nangyari dati na nagsasuggest na hindi naman ganoon ka-petty si Bebot.

Enter Tomas Alcid.

According sa mga sources ko sa Malacanang, si Bebot ang nag-endorso kay Alcid at nilagay siya sa Port of Cagayan de Oro, isa sa mga pinaka-busy na pantalan sa bansa. Ang problema, hindi raw kinaya ni Alcid ang bigat ng trabaho, kayat inilipat siya ni Faeldon sa Port Irene sa Cagayan.

Bakit Port Irene? Kasi dead port ang Port Irene ngayon, halos walang ganap doon e.

Hindi nagreklamo si Bebot sa pagkakalipat ni Alcid doon so in fairness kay Bebot, hindi naman siya ganoon kapilit.
Meanwhile, etong si Tita Mandy, tila may pangarap pang maging Social Media Superstar: gumawa nga ng Facebook Page e. At ito namang si Farinas, walang ginawa kundi mag-""Boy Gatong."" Di na nga dumadakdak si Bebot, pero siya naman ang dakdak ng dakdak.

Sa totoo lang, wala akong paki kung magbangayan sila forever. Ang problema lang kasi, baka ito ang maging dahilan ng pag-atras ng kung anumang reporma na ang naisagawa ni Faeldon.


If theres one thing na sigurado ko, iyon yung hindi kurakot si Faeldon, at alam nating mahirap humanap ng Customs Commissioner na hindi kurakot. Meanwhile, mukhang sumusunod naman sa yapak niya yung karamihan ng mga deputy commissioner.

Kaya lang, nadidiskaril ang performance ng customs dahil dalawang linggo nang walang tigil ang hearing. As in hindi na makatrabaho ang mga opisyal ng customs kasi buong araw silang nakatengga sa kongreso. Kung magtatagal pa raw ito (at mukhang magtatagal nga), may posibilidad raw na isa-isa na silang magbitiw dahil sa pagkabwisit.

Oo ganoon kagulo, ganoon kalala.

Ang Malinaw sa Malabo
Batay sa mga nakalap kong impormasyon, malinaw ang mga sumusunod:

UNA, walang political savvy si Anderson. 
Isa lang siyang loose cannon na hindi marunong magpigil kung kailangan. Aba, matabil rin ang dila ko sa ThinkingPinoy pero ang dami ko nang article ang hindi isinulat dahil alam kong magtimpi kung kailangan.

Hindi niyo ba napapansin na madalang na akong magsulat kumpara noong isang taon? Iyon ay dahil binibigyan ko ng pagkakataon ang mga taong magtino bago ko tirahin. Ang diprensiya naman kay Mandy, tira lang nang tira.

Saka mga teh, nasaan naman ang delikadesa ni Mandy nang sa kasagsagan ng word war niya with Congress e gumawa pa talaga siya ng Facebook Page? Kumusta naman ang fighting spirit ni ate?
PANGALAWA, mataas ang tiwala ni Faeldon kay Anderson.
Hindi ko to maintindihan. Sophomore lawyer pa lang si ate. Oot Top 5 siya sa bar, pero yung diskarte at loopholes sa batas, hindi iyon nae-exam: nakukuha lang yon sa experience. Despite this, tila willing si Faeldon na isugal lahat para kay Anderson. Parang may mali.

PANGATLO, malakas ang impluwensiya ni Farias kay Alvarez.
Bumabanat si Farinas pero tila walang imik si Bebot. Cong. Farinas, hinay-hinay lang. Hindi ka na cute, pramis. Dinetain mo na nga yung Ilocos 6 kahit labag sa batas, tapos iiskor ka pa uli? Ser, hindi lang ikaw ang anak ng Diyos.

Sa yugtong ito, malinaw na ang brouhaha sa kongreso ay nagmumula sa dalawang bagay:
Angas ni Anderson.
Gatong ni Farinas.

In short, may tatlo tayong posibleng course of action:
Ituloy lang ang kasalukuyan
Sibakin si Farinas
Sibakin si Anderson

Tarat tingnan natin ang bawat isa.

Alin ang best course of action?
UNA, continuing the status quo is bad idea. Ieerode lang nito lalo ang kredibilidad ng lower house dahil nagmumukha lang silang mga batang nag-aagawan ng kendi. Wala itong magandang idudulot, at maaaring dahil rito ay bumalik ang Customs nang tuluyan sa dati nitong gawi.

Diyos ko! Marami na tayong matitinong customs deputy commissioners! Ayaw ko silang mag-resign dahil namuryot lang sa hearing! NAKAKA-STRESS!

PANGALAWA, hindi masisibak si Farias. Kahit paanong tumbling pa ang gawin natin diyan, elected official si Farias at kahit hindi ako nakukyutan sa kanya dahil sa ginawa niya sa Ilocos 6, hindi ko maikakailang nasa kanya ang suporta ng mayorya.

Kumbaga, fait accompli na si Farias, wala nang magagawa doon.

At dahil rito, we are left with nothing but the third option: Sibakin si Anderson.

Ang problema? Ayaw ni Faeldon na sibakin si Anderson.

Ang lalong problema? Masisibak rin naman si Anderson kahit hindi siya sibakin ni Faeldon.

Alam niyo kasi, ang mga head executive assistants (staffers) tulad ni Anderson ay hindi allowed na mag-exercise ng kapangyarihang nangangailangan ng discretion. Yung mga nilista kong powers ni Anderson sa isang previous na section? Sa Deputy Commissioner dapat inatas yan.

Dahil diyan, panigurado kong madaling maipanalo ang kasong Usurpation of Authority laban kay Anderson, na siyang ikasisibak ni ate.

Usurpation of Authority?
Oo, tulad noong ginawa ni Undersecretary Joel Egco nang akuin nito ang dapat ay para kay Sec. Andanar lang, at tulad rin noong ipinaratang ni Ombudsman Morales kay former police chief Purisima.

In short, whether Faeldon fires her or not, she will probably get terminated anyway.

Thus, Commissioner Faeldon, I think you may want to just fire her immediately, instead of allowing her presence to exacerbate the already precarious situation. Mahaba ang pagdinig sa kaso na yan, at pihadong tuloy-tuloy ang bangayan hanggang nililitis yan. 

Sir Nic, gusto mo ba yon? Ikabubuti ba ng administrasyon yon? Hindi ser.

Besides, shes already very pregnant so shell take a leave of absence na rin. Siguro, kung ayaw mo i-fire, kahit sabihan mo na lang sigurong mag-leave of absence na lang agad, pero di ko sure kung enough na ito para tigilan ka ng kamara.

Regardless, the more she talks, the more problems Duterte will have. Hindi ko sinasabing si Anderson lang ang dapat sisihin sa nangyari, pero malinaw na sinasabi kong kung tsutsugiin lang, si Anderson ang dispensable at wala nang iba.

Boss Nic, sometimes, you have to make decisions for the sake of the greater good, And this time, it's the decision to fire that sophomore lawyer who bites more than she can chew.

So, ser, ano na?

Dutertes SONA marks start of Rapplers end?,"Will Rappler close down soon?

In his 2017 State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Rodrigo Duterte took a swipe at online-only news site Rappler when he said:
You know, if youre a newspaper, you are supposed to be 100 percent Filipino. And yet when you start to pierce their identity, [you discover that] it is fully owned by Americans. Thats what happened. Its just a matter of piercing the ABS, Rappler, thats you? Have you tried to pierce your identity and it will lead you to America? Do you know that? And yet the constitution requires you to be 100 percent --- media --- Filipino. Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up American ownership.
I think this wasnt part of the SONA script so President Duterte said this in his trademark Binisayang Tagalog, which can be cryptic to many in Luzon, so let me restate what he said.

Essentially, Duterte said the following:
Media companies are supposed to be 100% Filipino owned.
Some media companies find clandestine ways to get around this restriction.
Rappler, when examined, is owned by Americans.
I think its best to start from Square One.

Moreover, I apologize for the typographical errors in this article. I do not have the time to check for grammar and punctuation because I have a radio guesting and a wedding to attend to today. Seriously.

Lets go.


Rapplers Ownership: Early Days
Rappler (Rappler Inc.)started in 2011 with the following owners:
Journalist Maria Ressa (57%), 
Mining mogul Benjamin Bitanga et al (through Dolphin Fire, 20%)
DMT Ice Angels Holdings (17%)
Others (6%)
Rapplers ownership structure remained pretty much the same for the next two years, save for a short blip in October 2012, when a certain Cappadocia Inc. appeared to own 29% (taken from Maria Ressas stake), only for it disappear in its list of stockholders a year later.

Buyers remorse? I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.

In July 2014, Bitanga raised his stake at the company from 20 to 31%, and another investor, a certain Benjamin So, gained a 3% stake in the media outfit.
Then came a reorganization in 2015, when Rappler drastically diluted its shares to allow its newly-formed parent company Rappler Holdings to gain a 99% stake in the media company, basically adding a corporate layer, with Rapplers ownership structure basically mimicking that of Rappler Holdings via the Grandfather Rule.

The Grandfather Rule determines the actual Filipino ownership and control in a corporation by tracing both the direct and indirect shareholdings in the corporation [PWC].

That is, whoever owns Rappler Holdings owns Rappler Inc.

Rapplers Ownership: Post-restructuring
Since 2015, Rappler Incs owners are:
Maria Ressa (24%)
Bitanga et Al (via Dophin Fire, 31%) 
Manny Ayala (via Hatchd Group, 18%)
Benjamin So (18%)
Public Trust and Media Group (5%)
Others (~5%)
DMT Ice Angels, who owned a state before 2015, initially piqued interest because its owners are unknown, with Maria Ressa once saying that it belongs to private couple who wish to remain anonymous. Some camps speculated that its ABS-CBN, but judging from Manny Ayalas presence in Rapplers board since 2011, and Hatchds entry after DMT Ice Angels exit, then DMT should have been Manny Ayalas.

But were digressing.
A regular person would surely ask why Rappler would bother complicating its life by creating a holding firm  a corporate layer  when Rappler Holdings only significant (and known) subsidiary is Rappler itself, based on Rappler Holdings' consolidated Annual Financial Statements (link to 2015 CAFS at beginning of article).

Well, a look at Rappler Incs annual Audited Financial Statements provide a clue.

Let's start with their yearly Statements of Comprehensive income.


If you can't see the table clearly, here's a clearer copy.

Rappler incurred P9 million in losses in 2011 and P23 million in 2012. I would say that thats acceptable because Rappler was just starting at the time. In reality, I would even understand if Rappler repeated its 2012 financial performance in 2013.

But what happened was much, much worse: Rappler posted P71 million in losses in 2013.

Yes, it appears that Rappler is financially hemorrhaging: not just bleeding, but haemophiliac-level hemorrhaging.

A Change of Scale?
I think itd be unfair to judge Rapplers financial performance solely on that. After all, Rappler appears to have scaled up its operations in 2013 when it posted twice as much income as 2012 (P58 M vs P23 M) against around twice as much expenses (P127 M vs P57 M).

You see, Rappler could have benefited from economies of scale. That is, Rappler could have reduced costs by increasing production levels.

In fairness to Rappler, its Operating Expense to Revenue (OER) Ratio (lower is better) improved from around 2.4 in 2012 to around 2.2 in 2013. That is, Rappler spent 2.4 pesos for every peso it earned in 2012, and the situation improved to 2.2 pesos for every peso in 2013.
Yes, Rappler is still losing a lot of money, but it can be said that the rate of loss has, whether significantly or insignificantly, gone down.

Of course, like any other company, Rappler will lose money (OER > 1) before it becomes profitable (OER < 1). And by 2013, or barely two years into existence, Rappler appears to be on its way to becoming profitable.

However, the question stands: will it reach profitability before it goes bankrupt?

I think the answer is in 2014.

Rappler registered P116 M in revenues against P148 M expenses in 2014, suggesting an OER of 1.27, a drastic improvement from its OER of 2.2 the previous year. Yes, it appears that Rappler just needs a little more time and its going to be profitable at last.

The drastic increase in profitability can be explained by either of the following possibilities:
Rappler indeed got more income-generating deals, or
Somebody injected money into Rappler and made it appear as income.
Regardless Konti na lang, keri na si Rappler! 

Almost Broke: Rappler in 2014
But then again, does Rappler have time?

Rappler had P8 million in liquid assets by the end of 2014, and this was made possible by a P24 million cash loan from someone among Rapplers ranks.

According to its 2014 Financials:
The amounts owed to related parties amounting to P24,000,000 as at December 31,2014 were used for working capital purposes. These amounts are non-interest bearing and considered payable on demand.
In short, it appears that one of Rapplers owners extended a critical financial lifeline to Rappler, without which Rappler wouldve already been dead by mid-2014.

However, with only P8-million in cash in December 2014 and P24 million in debt that can be collected anytime, Rappler needs to get additional capital before it goes bust.

I remember a friend, who happens to be a top executive in one of the four top accounting firms in the country, telling me:
Did Rappler create Rappler holdings to mitigate the effects of an impending bankruptcy?
He said that Rappler can protect some of its earnings by transferring them to Rappler Holdings, which will shield those transferred earnings from bankruptcy proceedings.

But then again, Rappler is just three years old at this time. Its still a startup, so owners can argue that it just needs a bit more capital and itll be fine real soon.

Enter, Foreigners!
I do not really know why Rappler had to resort to foreign money, but it did. But foreign ownership of media companies is illegal, so how did Rappler manage to do it?

Rappler circumvented foreign ownership restrictions by issuing at least US$ 4 million in Philippine Depository Receipts (PDRs) [SycipLaw], all or part of which were sold to American firm Omidyar Network and Malaysia-based NorthBase Media.

Proponents of PDR financial instruments argue that PDRs technically remove the concept of ownership in a persons investments while allowing that person to benefit from the shares. That is, the PDR owner is technically not an owner of the shares (avoiding the issue of ownership restrictions), but just like an owner of the shares, benefits from dividends issued by the company.

Heres how PDRs basically work:

First, Joe (a foreigner) wants to invest in Juan (a Filipino Mass Media company), but is unable to do so directly due to foreign ownership restrictions.

Second, Joe gives money to Pedro (another Filipino company), then Pedro uses it to invest in Juan. Juan then becomes a shareholder (owner) in Pedro.

Third, given this, Joe appears to own part of Pedro through the legal concept called Grandfather Rule. Through the Grandfather Rule, if Joe owns half of Pedro and Pedro owns half of Juan, then Joe owns half of half (one-fourth) of Juan, but Joe owning any part of Juan is illegal right?

Fourth, the Grandfather Rule makes it near-impossible for foreigners to own any stake in local mass media companies. But PDRs are allow Joe to evade that restriction.

Heres another way to look at it:
Pedro buys 50 shares from Juan, then Pedro repackages by creating 5 special documents with each stating something like This document represents 10 shares in Juan. Joe then buys those 5 documents, effectively granting Joe ownership over Pedros 50 shares in Juan. That is, Pedro appears to be the owner 50 Juan stocks despite the fact that Joe is really the one who owns it.
In short, Pedro serves as Joes dummy investor for the latters investment in Juan. 

That is, Rappler Holdings is the foreigners dummy investor for their investment in Rappler Inc.

And this is how Rappler was able to allow foreign capital to enter its bank accounts.

And heres where it gets more interesting.

What made Omidyar nod in 2015?
American investment fund Omidyar Network announced in November 2015 that it would invest in Rappler [TiA], presumably after talks that happened between Omidyar and Rappler earlier in that year.

I think that Rappler had the stuff to impress Omidyar at that time.
Rapplers core team members have impressive resumes.
Rapplers bread-and-butter, its website, showed signs of continuous massive growth in web traffic.
Rappler has shown marked improvement in profitability, as shown by its drastically improved expense-to-income ratio (OER).
Yes, Rappler showed major promise when it knocked on Omidyars doors, and I can only assume that it showed the same data to Northbase Media.

Rappler demonstrated amazing web traffic growth from birth to year 2015.

Post-2015: A Broken Promise?
Omidyar et. Al. injected massive cash into Rappler in 2015, presumably with the expectation that Rappler, despite still being unprofitable, is well on its way to profitability. After all, by the looks of it, all Rappler needs is additional capital and its gonna be okay soon.

But after the deal, Rappler showed signs of plateauing growth, or something even worse.

Rappler indeed registered an increase in profitability with an OER of about 1.27 during the 2015 talks with Omidyar as oppose to over 2 in the previous year. By the end of 2015, however, Rappler registered around P178-million in expenses against P142-million in revenues, suggesting an OER of around 1.25.

A mere 0.02 improvement from the previous year is negligible, and it painfully pales in comparison to the OER improvement in the previous period. Worse, 1.25 is still along way to go, as Rappler needs to reach an OER of less than 1 before it gets out of the red.

Of course, a 0.02 per year decrease wont cut it. With a 2015 OER of 1.25, it'd take Rappler 13 years of growth before it makes money, and I guess nobody has the patience to wait that long.

ReachSocial: Not just news
Rappler argues that it earns from more than just its website, with its ReachSocial providing two major services: big data analytics and social media consultancies. However, ReachSocials big data analytics suggest that Rappler has a sufficiently big data source, i.e. Rapplers website traffic.

Unfortunately, Rapplers site traffic stopped growing and started sliding in mid-2015. It recovered and beat the mid-2015 peak during the 2016 election season, but the sites traffic continued its decline to pre-2015 levels soon after.

rank2traffic.com/rappler.com
Rapplers Big Data Analytics services will earn only if it has a unique and proprietary big data pool to play with, and a site with shrinking traffic wont provide that. After all, if Rappler provided nothing but generic big data services, then a client is better off consulting a company with a longer and more proven history of competence on the matter.

While it can be argued that Rappler still remains to be the third most visited mass media website in the country, the rising dominance of social media-based news, along with the proliferation of independent news site in the local market, suggests that mainstream news sites now have a smaller pie to share amongst themselves. Add Rapplers dwindling traffic and things will look even worse.

Rappler and Social Media
Rapplers social media performance in the Philippines, in terms of user engagement, is in the doldrums as it consistently trails behind independent one-man shows like Mocha Uson Blog, Sass Rogando Sasot, and Thinking Pinoy, each of which registers at least thrice as much engagement as Rappler. To make matters worse, Rappler also trails behind mainstream competitors ABS-CBN, GMA News, the Inquirer, DZRH, and News5.
Facebook Insights Data as of 0650 hrs GMT+8
With that said, I do not see how one would consult with someone who lags behind in social media. If Rappler knows social media, it would have demonstrated much better Facebook Insights figures.

Moreover, owing to Facebooks privacy policy, I have reason to believe that Rapplers more reliable social media analytics services are based heavily on Twitter. Unfortunately, Facebook, and not Twitter, is the single most dominant network in the Philippines. Thus, its fair to question whether Rapplers social analytics data are representative of the entire Filipino Population.

Rapplers losing fight on social media is best evidenced by how its CEO Maria Ressa incessantly complains about the unfairness of Facebook Algorithms, as she blames her competitors, sans definitive evidence, for gaming Facebooks news feed algorithms to gain an edge over hers.

Omidyars Influence on Rappler
Rappler has P96-million cash at the end of 2015, and it posts an average comprehensive losses of P30-million pesos in the years 2014 and 2015. Rappler, after showing no significant improvement in OER in the past year, may go bankrupt in as early as 2018.

And heres where the foreign ownership issue comes into play.

Ressas rants about how social media works started right after she met with Omidyar executives in Spain in October 2016, suggesting that something must have transpired during that meeting, something that made Ressa, reportedly an affirmation addict, anxious enough to go on a multi-article rant about how the world does not work in her favor.

October 2016 is a year after Omidyar first announced that it would invest in Rappler.

I can only speculate about what it exactly is, but whats clear to me is that Omidyar classifies Rappler as a for-profit investment, i.e. Omidyar expects Rappler to make money. The preceding sections, however, strongly suggest that Rappler wont do that anytime soon.

I think heres where the prohibition of foreign ownership on Mass Media

Yes, it appears that Omidyar may be pressuring Rappler to improve in a manner that Omidyar sees fit. Now, Ressa may still argue that Omidyar doesnt own Rappler, but I refuse to believe that the framers of the 1987 Constitution wanted foreigners to influence local mass media in any way.

Framers wanted 100% Filipino ownership of mass media firms exactly because they want to minimize direct foreign influence local on mass media operations and, by extension, on Filipino public opinion.

Rappler can argue all day about it being 100% Filipino-owned, but who are we kidding here?

Rapplers Uncertain Future
Truth be told, I doubt that any foreign investor who is aware of Rapplers post-2014 financials would risk betting on Rappler today.

But lets go back to Omidyar.

Its bad enough that Omidyar has reportedly conspired with the US government to topple a Ukrainian government, but Omidyars continued financial presence in Rappler can do more than just drive Ressa mad.

Remember, Rappler is not showing signs of reaching profitability anytime soon, so it shall continue to rely on capital infusions to stay alive.

Rappler is already on its sixth year, and it's gonna be harder and harder for Ressa to call Rappler a ""startup"", which would have justified the massive losses Rappler continously incurs.

If Omidyar finally throws in the towel and divests in Rappler (or writes off their failed investment as losses), Rapplers PDRs will be as valuable as junk. That is, Rappler can finally say goodbye to any hope of raising any new capital from foreigners.

Thus, Rappler would be forced to swallow its pride and raise capital from local sources but

Rappler has shown a clear bias versus the Duterte Administration, and the Duterte Government has shown a clear dislike of Rappler, as accentuated by Dutertes 2017 SONA. In light of local businessmens aversion to going against the sitting government, I am confident that businessmen can find investments that pose less political and financial risks.

Now, Rappler can try to weather the financial storm, but the Duterte Government still has five more years to go. 

I believe Maria will do everything -- and I mean everything -- to keep Rappler alive. After all, it's her baby. I think she's already doing a few things right now. As to what those ""few things"" are, I'd rather not say.

But let's ask this one final question...

Will Rappler survive past 2022? I have my well-founded doubts.",RJ Nieto,"July 29, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/07/dutertes-sona-marks-start-of-rapplers.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
AirAsia and that excess baggage called Jamela Alindogan,"My gahd! I heyt drahgs.

On July 20th, AirAsia Philippines announced that it would give free baggage allowance of up to 40 kg plus in-flight meals and snacks for Armed Forces personnel assigned to peacekeeping missions.

AirAsia Philippines promo was launched after its CEO, Captain Dexter Comendador, witnessed the Bayanihan spirit among Filipinos as passengers of a July 18th AirAsia flight bound to Davao volunteered to take in the excess baggage of soldiers, who were also on the same flight.

One of the passengers, a certain Inday Rakel, said:
I am blessed to somehow help them with their luggage, and that was a little thank you for the bigger job they are doing. But, we are even blessed to have these men who are ready to die for our freedom, for our land [ABS].
At a time of extreme political division, stories like these are what this country needs. Here we saw regular Filipinos showing respect and affection to our soldiers who are risking their lives for our freedom, and a company that decides to take that same respect and affection to another level.
Yes, this is one of those moments where we can say, Ah! I am proud to be a Filipino.

But wait! Al Jazeeras Jamela Alindogan won't have any of that shit.


Jamela poops on the parade
On July 21st or just last night, Al Jazeera reporter Jamela Alindogan tweeted:

I dont get these airlines (sic) giving 40kg to soldiers from Marawi. What are they expected to bring back apart from their own bag of belongings?

Yeah, for all her supposed knowledge about whats going on in Marawi, she really still had to ask.

One Twitter user who goes by the name Sgt. John Emmanuel Sison, replied:
I am a soldier and an officer of the AFP. Do you have any idea how much our basic deployment packs weigh? Have you carefully read the terms of the perk? Try placing a pair of combat boots in the scale and tell us how much it weighs.
Other Twitter users were not as forgiving, as IAmJennie (@B3A3S0M3) tweeted: 
You will never get it until you learn the definition of compassion... Pero syempre money talks... Magkano po?
Another user,  Ronald Beldad (@superb_RB) tweeted: 
At least they have something to offer for the soldiers. Eh ikaw anu maooffer mo? Gaga!
I, myself, replied:
Hoy Jamela, papasulubungan ka nila ng utak kaya magpasalamat ka na lang. Choosy ka pa e. Yang pagkamanhid-na-asshole mo na yan ang nagdudulot ng bashing laban sa iyo, tapos mamaya, iiyak ka naman ng bullying. Leche.
Not her first time
I myself do not know how much a soldiers typical baggage is supposed to weigh. However, whats important in AirAsias gesture is not what the company gave, but its decision to give something, no matter how seemingly insignificant it is.

But Alindogan, despite her supposed journalistic experience, went on to display such an astounding level of callousness that borders on idiocy.

And this is not her first time doing it.

In August 2016, Alindogan published a Facebook status post that reads:
Fifteen soldiers killed. Lives lost. More from the enemys side, reportedly. The number is expected to rise in the coming months because President Duterte has called on the Philippine Military to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf. But is it enough? Dj vu
Lives lost Because Duterte called on the Military Yes, Alindogan blamed Duterte for the deaths in the operations versus the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Is Alindogan high on Rugby? Does she expect the government to do nothing?

Ano, yan, Jamela, may masulat lang?

Of course, she got her fair share of acerbic and extra spicy rebukes from netizens over that stunt.

I can only see two possibilities at this point:

Alindogan is so stupid that she had to commit the same mistake twice, or,
Alindogan is such a famewhore that she needs to court controversy by unnecessarily provoking the grieving public then pulling out the victim card in response.

Alindogan won't admit number 1, so so we are left with number two.

Hence, let's ask, why did Jamela bother posting such stupidity?

Alindogan wants another Swedish Award?
Does Alindogan want another Swedish Foreign Ministry award?

Given a few months after her insipid Abu Sayyaf post, the Swedish Foreign Ministry and UNESCO was recognized for for defying hate speech and threats, pursuing mission of providing citizens with the information needed to make enlightened decisions about their lives, their communities and their governments.

I do not understand how taunting the public with mind-boggling callousness qualifies as providing citizens with information needed to make enlightened decisions.

I KENNAT.

Moreover, I also do not understand how online criticism agains Alindogan qualifies as hate speech, defined as speech that attacks, threatens, or insults a person or group on the basis of national origin, ethnicity, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.

Unless people are insulting her for her gargantuan pie hole, I do not see how Jamela, youre a moron. qualifies an attack against national origin, ethnicity, color, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.

But meh, she got the award anyway, so I guess the Abu Sayyaf stunt worked.

So, will it work this time?

Awards mean little
Alindogan tweeted at 8:41 PM Manila, and I expect a deluge of criticism headed toward Alindogans way tomorrow morning. So, will this tsunami of criticisms earn her another Swedish Award?

Pathetic. Alindogan can say that the Swedish think she's a great person, but can she say the same about the Filipino people?

Take a look at Krizette Chu, a private citizen who raised over a million pesos to care for the widows of soldiers killed in action in Marawi. She even found ways to provide 40 scholarship grants for the soldiers' orphaned children, and she even maintains a psychological support group of sorts for the widows.

And before you say that I do nothing, my readers and I have already donated P35,000 to the AFP Education Benefit System Office, the agency that helps send soldiers' orphans to school. I sent the amount a few days after the Marawi Clash commenced. 


There are many Filipinos who are trying their darned best to help in their own way. 

Some bought and wore #SupportOurTroops shirts to boost troop morale. Some have sent relief goods to evacuation centers. Some changed their social media profile pictures to show support.

And there's AirAsia, arguably the country's lowest-cost low-cost carrier, sacrificing part of its razor-thin profit margins just to support to our troops.

Here we are, trying to make sense out of the destruction and misery brought by war, and there is Jamela Alindogan, being stupid, as usual.

Jamela, the Excess Baggage
I find it ironic that this entire thing stemmed from the issue of excess baggage. ""Excess baggage""
 also serves as an idiom for any person or thing that is unnecessary or unwanted and thus is or becomes burdensome.

Alindogan qualifies as excess baggage: her commentaries, both unnecessary and unwanted, have become burdensome because of her relative visibility, thanks to her affiliation with a major news outfit.

I am not against journalists publishing casual posts, but I am against journalists publishing casual posts with little regard for those who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of this nation.

Jamela, youre stupid and a pathetic award from Sweden does not make you any smarter.

I would like to believe that you have a mental disorder, but I do not want to offend those who genuinely suffer such conditions.

Regardless, Jamela, get tested, please.

P.S. O baka mamaya sasabihin mong binubully kang leche ka. STOP BEING AN ASSHOLE para di ka nakakarma.

DONT FORGET TO SHARE! Did you like this post? Help ThinkingPinoy stay up! Even as little as 50 pesos will be a great help!

Conchita's Trojan Horse: Weak Mamasapano cases to provide PNoy immunity?,"You think the Ombudsman's had a change of heart? Think again.

In the article Aquino faces raps for usurpation of authority over Mamasapano mess [Inq] released earlier today, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales surprised the entire country as she indicted former President Benigno PNoy Aquino for usurpation of authority and graft for his involvement in the 2015 Mamasapano debacle.

Why surprising? An Aquino appointee, Carpio-Morales has staunchly shown support for Aquinos agenda.

Lets cite a couple of examples: the 2012 Corona Impeachment Trial, and the 2014 Napoles PDAF Scam.

Conchita vs Renato : As Atty. Paula Defensor-Knack points out, Carpio-Morales agreed to provide hearsay testimony against then-embattled Chief Justice Renato Corona when she testified about Coronas alleged bank deposits. Carpio-Morales supposedly received the information from a discovery of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), so the AMLC shouldve testified instead of Carpio-Morales [Star]. Morales, a retired Supreme Court associate justice, is fully aware of the hearsay rule.

And before I forget, one of the prime choices for Coronas replacement, at the time, was SC Associate her own cousin [MT], Justice Antonio Carpio [Inq].

And of course, we all know how that Corona Impeachment Trial ended.

Conchita vs JPE, Bong, and Jinggoy : The Ombudsman then filed graft charges vs former Senators Juan Ponce Enrile, Bong Revilla, and Jinggoy Estrada, over their alleged involvement in Janet Lim-Napoles P10-billion Pork barrel (PDAF) Scam [Inq]. They were subsequently detained in the Philippine National Police (PNP) custodial center as the trial progresses.

I will not comment on whether the three senators deserve what they went through, but whats clear to me is that the Ombudsman clearly turned a blind eye on Liberal Party members and allies who are involved in the PDAF Scam. At the top of this no-hit list is Aquino budget secretary Florencio Butch Abad, who gave the imprimatur of the PDAF releases [Inq].


Yes, Carpio-Morales did not include Abad in the charges even if Napoles herself testified that it was Abad who taught her how to use non-government organizations to steal money from the National Treasury [Star].
Now that Ive pretty much shown you how Conchita went against her better judgement in support of the Aquino Administration, let me now focus on how she handled the cases filed against Aquino himself.

Conchitas first jab at DAP
Carpio-Morales in 2015 dismissed the case arising from the illegal implementation of the multi-billion-peso Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) Scam, arguing that Aquinos alleged technical malversation is not an impeachable offense and that the president enjoys immunity from suit at the time [Star].

Now, lets recall the kinds of impeachable offenses under the 1987 constitution:
Culpable violation of the Constitution, 
Treason, 
Bribery, 
Graft and corruption, 
Other high crimes, and
Betrayal of public trust.
I am inclined to agree with Carpio-Morales verdict that technical malversation does not fall under the first five impeachable offenses, but given the number of counts of technical malversation hes liable for, I am pretty confident that Carpio-Morales could have easily made the case fall under betrayal of public trust.

As Ambassador Bobi Tiglao pointed out, Aquino committed 1,997 counts of technical malversation through the DAP scam, owing to the 1,997 Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) that Aquino himself approved and signed [MT].

A couple of technical malversation cases may not constitute Betrayal of Public Trust, but almost 2,000?

I bet the public, when they elected Aquino, trusted him to be smart enough not to commit 2,000 technical malversations, yet he did.

Aquino betrayed our trust, because we trusted that hes smart enough to NOT BE THAT STUPID.

Aquino cases post-presidency
The technical malversation case, and its subsequent dismissal, served as a reminder to Aquino critics to hold their horses until Aquino stepped out of Malacaang, and thats what they did. Thats why Aquino was slapped with case after case after June 30, 2016.
Let us enumerate each of the cases filed since Aquino stepped down last year:
TECHNICAL MALVERSATION: Activists also revived the 2015 technical malversation complaint over DAP, arguing that Aquino has lost immunity from suit [Inq].
TREASON: The Duterte Administration sued Aquino and Senator Sonny Trillanes for the botched 2013 backdoor negotations with China which allegedly emboldened Beijing to become more aggressive in the South China Sea [Inq].
HOMICIDE: Aquino was sued for reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide as a result of his alleged negligence in approving the botched 2015 Mamasapano Operation [Inq]. 
USURPATION OF AUTHORITY: Aquino was also implicated as having influenced then PNP Director-General Alan Purisima to usurp authority as the latter handle the Mamasapano operation despite being preventively suspended by the Ombudsman at the time [Inq].
GRAFT: Former Customs Commissioner Napoleon Morales also filed a graft complaint against Aquino and his Finance secretary Cesar Purisima, for failing to collect P100-billion taxes by allegedly turning a blind eye on Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp.s alleged smuggling of gasoline components, imports which the firm considered nontaxable [Inq].
Now, lets check what has happened so far.

Conchita on Aquino cases post-Aquino
Before today, there appears to be a trend of dismissal after dismissal of cases filed against Aquino.

ON TECHNICAL MALVERSATION: In March 2017, Carpio-Morales cleared Aquino of Technical Malversation raps over the multi-billion pesos DAP scam, arguing that the issuance of the SAROs cannot be equated with application of public funds [ABS].

Now, I do not understand how she can say public funds were not applied when SAROs themselves allow the transfer of funds from the National Treasury to whatever that SARO was for. Thats just like saying you did not help a rapist because all you did was unlock the victims bedroom door.


ON TREASON: In June 2017, Carpio-Morales cleared Aquino of treason charges [Inq], arguing that Treason is a war crime. It is not an all-time offense. It cannot be committed in peacetime [MS].

Now, I do not understand how China wants to take away our territory since I cant remember! can be considered peacetime. Given how loosely Carpio-Morales interpreted the law during Coronas impeachment, her strictness in defining wartime is nothing short of discombobulating.

So far, Carpio-Morales has dismissed two out of the five cases against aquino, so to recap, we are left with three:
Reckless Imprudence resulting to Homicide vis-a-vis Mamasapano
Usurpation of Authority vis-a-vis Mamasapano
Graft vis-a-vis Shells willfully uncollected taxes
This brings us back to our main topic: the Aquinos cases involving the Mamasapano Debacle.
As Ive mentioned earlier in the article, the Philippines was shocked after it discovered that Carpio-Morales suddenly and uncharacteristically decided to file cases against Aquino. After so many years of protecting him, some doubters finally felt some sliver of hope that maybe, just maybe, this Ombudsman finally saw the light.

To cut the long story short, Carpio-Morales dismissed the homicide case, then recommended the filing of usurpation and graft cases against Aquino.


And after examining the Inquirer article, there appears to be something really, really wrong.

Conchita dimisses Homicide
Carpio-Morales dismissed the homicide angle, the angle which my lawyer-friends argued is the easiest prove among all possible cases related to the Mamasapano clash.

Homicide is essentially defined as the unjustified killing of a human being which does not constitute murder, parricide, or infanticide, and this may be committed by negligence [BatasNatin].

Aquino committed homicide on two levels:

FIRST, Aquino authorized the SAF operation despite an existing ceasefire agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. He allowed the SAF to infiltrate MILF territory, despite the clear knowledge that the MILF will retaliate if engaged.

But the SECOND level is much, much darker: Aquino refused to order the Armed Forces to send reinforcements to the PNP SAF commandos, despite the latters request.

SAF Director Getulio Napeas said they requested for reinforcements in as early as 6:00 AM, January 25th. He said the SAF commandos were still alive by 12 noon of the same day, waiting for reinforcements. No reinforcements came, and they lost contact an hour later.

Aquino and Purisima were monitoring the operations that entire while. During those critical hours, the two had two options:
Send AFP reinforcements, or
Order SAF to pull back, to retreat
Aquino and Purisima chose neither. The two willfully allowed 44 SAF commandos to die.

Now, tell me how that cannot be homicide. But no! Carpio-Morales argues that Aquino's allowed to go.

The Other Mamasapano Cases
Now this becomes more interesting, as Carpio-Morales green-lighted the filing of usurpation and graft raps vs Aquino, to the delight of Aquino critics.

But as it turns out, this is a Trojan Horse.

A Trojan Horse is someone or something that is used to hide what is true or real in order to trick or harm an enemy [MW] -- and we are Conchita's enemies, because we want Aquino behind bars.

I will show that what appears to be a positive development from the Common Taos point of view is actually something that will turn out to be against the Common Taos interests.
At first glance, the filing of this case appears to be the end of Aquinos impunity under Carpio-Morales. However, this case will actually render him immune from liability over the Mamasapano Debacle.

To illustrate my point, let us discuss the two cases separately, starting with Usurpation of Authority.
[The] circumstances clearly show that Purisima acted as if he was not under preventive suspension and as if no OIC PNP chief was designated and acting as such Purisima would not have been placed in such a position (despite the) preventive suspension were it not for the complicity and influence of President Aquino, Carpio said [Inq].
The key concept that will clear Purisima and Aquino from this charge is preventive suspension.


Aquino and Usurpation of Authority
The [Revised Penal Code Art. 177] defines Usurpation of Authority as:
Usurpation of authority or official functions.  Any person who shall knowingly and falsely represent himself shall perform any act pertaining to any [government official], without being lawfully entitled to do so, shall suffer the penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods.
Recall that Purisima was simply on preventive suspension and according to the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service [CSC]:

Preventive Suspension, nature. Preventive suspension is not a penalty. It is designed merely as a measure of precaution so that the official or employee charged may be removed from the scene of his/her alleged misfeasance/malfeasance/nonfeasance while the same is being investigated.
An order of preventive suspension may be issued to temporarily remove the respondent from the scene of his/her misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance to preclude the possibility of exerting undue influence or pressure on the witnesses against him/her, or tampering with evidence that may be used against him/her.
In lieu of preventive suspension, for the same purpose, the proper disciplining authority or head of office, may reassign respondent to other unit of the agency during the formal hearings.
In Purisimas case, the preventive suspension only prevented him from entering PNP premises, but HE STILL REMAINED AS PNP CHIEF. Yes, he was issuing order to Napenas, but he can issue the orders remotely because outside PNP premises, he was still the PNP Chief. Moreover, the Mamasapano had nothing to do with the Werfast case, the cause of his preventive suspension.

In short, Aquino can can argue that Purisima did not pretend to be PNP chief because for all intents and purposes of the Mamasapano clash, he indeed was PNP chief.

So whose authority did Purisima usurp in this case? No ones.

Hence, if Purisima did not usurp authority, then Aquino could not have conspired with Purisima to usurp authority. After all, conspiracy to usurp authority can only be committed if authority has indeed been usurped.

Moreover, Aquinos approval of Purisimas actions during the Mamasapano Clash reinforces this argument. After all, they were exchanging text message throughout the entire operation [EagleNews].

Remember that all executive power emanates from the President, and that includes PNPs powers. PNP Officer-in-Charge Leonardo Espina was indeed bypassed, but he was bypassed through the authority of the President, the same person where Espinas authority emanates from.

Did Aquino help usurp Espinas authority when in fact, Espinas authority emanates from Aquino?

In short, the usurpation case against Aquino AND Purisima will likely be dismissed.

Aquino and Graft
Aquino was also ordered charged for graft or violation of Section 3(a) of Republic Act 3019 for violating the Ombudsmans preventive suspension with the complicity and influence of President Aquino, the Ombudsman said [Inq].

RA 3019 Section 3(a) states [LawPhil]:
Persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority or an offense in connection with the official duties of the latter, or allowing himself to be persuaded, induced, or influenced to commit such violation or offense.
Recalling the explanation in the previous section, Aquino can argue that Purisima did not violate the Ombudsmans preventive suspension order to begin with, based on two reasons:
Purisima was not physically present in any PNP property during the ordeal.
Purisimas orders had nothing to do with the reason for which he was suspended, i.e. Mamasapano and Werfast are unrelated.
Moreover, Aquino can also argue that his permitting to order Purisima is, no matter how fleeting, a temporary removal of PNP OIC Espina, as Aquino, being the Chief Executive, has the authority to do so. By law, Aquino did not need even need to notify Espina about such temporary removal.

In short, the graft case against Aquino AND Purisima will likely be dismissed.

Conchitas Zarzuela
By dismissing the homicide case, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales basically left the government with two extremely weak and extremely problematic cases to pursue.

This provides Aquino, Purisima, and the Ombudsman, the chance to play a short zarzuela that can easily end in time for the Ombudsmans July 2018 retirement and were already on Act One.

ACT 1: Ombudsman recommends filing of the two weak cases, which has already happened.

ACT 2: Just for show, Aquino and Purisima can mount a weak appeal at the Office of the Ombudsman, and the latter will deny it.

ACT 3: Ombudsman actually files the case, and Aquino and Purisima are arraigned.

ACT 4: The court, which can act only upon the complaint provided, will see that the preventive suspension was not violated, thereby acquitting both Aquino and Purisima.

ACT 5: After the acquittal, both Aquino and Purisima cannot be sued anymore over the Mamasapano Clash because of the Rule on Double Jeopardy, i.e. or the prohibition on the persecution of a person twice for the same offense.

This case, instead a victory for the Mamasapano widows, will actually provide immunity to Aquino and Purisima... and thats how this became Conchita's Trojan Horse.


Epilogue
The Ombudsman has already dismissed the first three cases of Technical Malversation, Treason and Homicide. The previous section, on the other hand, shows that the Usurpation raps will eventually be dismissed, along with the bonus of protecting Aquino from any case related to Mamasapano.

Thus, we are left with one last case: Aquinos willfully neglecting to collect P100-billion for Shell.

I think Aquino will not need help from Conchita on that one.

After all, Shell has P100-billion to win that one, right?",RJ Nieto,"July 15, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/07/conchita-trojan-horse-weak-cases-Pnoy-immunity.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"""LIKE EVERYONE ELSE"": VP Robredo drove with expired license?","The opinions expressed in this article are solely of ThinkingPinoy (TP) and do not reflect the stance of any government agency.
Yesterday, Land Transportation Office  Bicol (LTO-Bicol) posted a status update, which states:
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. Today, Vice President Leni Robredo came to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) Naga District Office to renew her driver's license. Just like the rest of our clients, VP Robredo took a queueing number and waited for her turn in order to complete her transaction... The office practices fairness in dealing with its clients. It delivers the same kind of quality and efficient service to all Dios Mabalosa po sa LTO Naga! #ParaSaBayan #LTOBicolHappyToServeYou
The update, posted on 11 July 2017, basically said Robredo renewed her drivers license yesterday.
Drivers licenses, by law, expire on the license holders birthday [Politiko]. Robredos birthday [INQ] is on April 23rd, so her drivers license must have expired on that day.

Driving without a license?
Despite the expired drivers license, Facebook user Benjie Daisy Contreras pointed out that VP Robredo drove a car on 21 June 2017 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Robredo drives a car in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
As Mark Lopez pointed out, the Registry of Motor Vehicles of the US State of Massachusetts [MassRMV] honors Philippine-issued drivers licenses so Robredo, in theory, can drive cars in the state provided that her Philippine license is still valid, which is not the case.

Note that Mass RMV, like most DMVs in the United States, does not honor International Driving Permits (IDPs) or Licenses [MassRMV].
Given that Robredo does not have a valid Philippine drivers license at the time she drove in Massachusetts, and that the State doesnt honor IDPs, there could only have been two other ways for her to drive legally in the US, and that is through a US-issued drivers license

The United States issues drivers licenses to the following:
Citizens 
Resident Aliens
Diplomats (issued by the Department of State, not a State DMV)
Clearly, the Robredo is neither a Citizen nor a Resident Alien, as both would disqualify her from assuming the vice-presidency, so we are left with the third possibility: a drivers license issued to diplomats.

Like everyone else?
However, diplomatic drivers licenses are issued only to members of diplomatic missions, and I do not exactly see how Robredo can be considered a member of a diplomatic mission, especially since insiders in the Department of Foreign Affairs themselves told me that Robredo did not notify some diplomatic missions in the United States about her Boston trip.
Moreover, affixing the seal of a diplomatic mission is required in the application form for diplomatic drivers licenses [DoS], so which seal would Robredo use?

Shes not part of the DFA, to begin with.

However, assuming that Robredo indeed has a diplomatic driver's license and that she used it when she was doing personal errands in Boston (which, by the way, was not an official visit of any sort), then she is not ""like everyone else.""",RJ Nieto,"July 12, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/07/like-everyone-else-vp-robredo-drove.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Did Verafiles ""Fact Check"", or did it just follow Trillanes' orders?","What a small world!


On 25 May 2017, Filipino New York Times photojournalist Jes Aznar posted an Instagram video of Filipino troops in the middle of battle in Marawi City [Video] with the original caption:
Flushing out an enemy sniper. In the middle of fighting in #Marawi #philippines #photojournalism #mindanao #terror #martiallaw #isis
I took a screenshot of the Instagram post and I included the following comment [FB]:

NYtimes/Inq photographer Jes Aznar posts live updates from Marawi, revealing the positions of government snipers to any terrorist with a smartphone. Tang ina, tanggalin niyo yang idiota na yan dyan!


My post caught the attention of netizens, which resulted into a hailstorm of criticism against Aznar.


In reaction, Aznar has revised the caption several times, and part of the latest iteration reads:
Flushing out an enemy sniper. In the middle of fighting in #Marawi #philippines #photojournalism #mindanao #terror #martiallaw #isis EDIT: NOT A LIVE FEED #latepost
Aznar also posted on Facebook that, among other things, threatened me with possible legal action.

I have chronicled much of the exchange between Aznar and I in the article NUJPs Condemnation: Jes Aznar, Marawi Siege, and Matobato, published on 20 June 2017.

Aznar cries for help
Aznar, the guy who claims to be brave enough to cover a war but cowers in fear of social media comments (what a whiny MF!), asked for backup from his mainstream media buddies.

First, there was NUJPs condemnation, which I have thoroughly addressed in NUJPs Condemnation: Jes Aznar, Marawi Siege, and Matobato. In that article, I explained the following:
Aznar claimed that the video was a late upload, despite the video being taken and uploaded on the same day.
I used the term Live update and not Live Feed, which a layman would define as information posted on or immediately after a subject-event.
NUJP failed to disclose in their condemnation its president, along with four out of its nine board of directors harbor conflicts of interest. They work for the Philippine Daily Inquirer which has a business relationship with the New York Times, Aznars premier client.
Second, he sought help from the National Press Club whose former president Joel Egco now heads the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, and I have also thoroughly addressed that in A Traitor in Malacaang? Media Security Usec. Joel Egco usurps Andanars authority.
And now, for Round Three, Aznar cried for help from Verafiles, an organization that describes itself as published by veteran Filipino journalists taking a deeper look into current Philippine issues.

Verafiles Fact-checks
Verafiles post attempted to debunk the following:
That Aznars video post was a live feed.
That the soldiers involved are government snipers.
That there were orders to arrest Aznar.
This is downright pathetic misrepresentation of the original post, which is disappointing, considering that the piece was written by Charmaine Deogracias, supposedly a veteran journalist. Before one does a fact check, one has to make sure that the facts he will check are the ones that are supposed to be checked in the first place.

First, my original Facebook post used the term Live Update and not Live Feed.
I have already explained this in a previous article and I do not understand why Deogracias, for all her pride in being a veteran journalist, missed it entirely. Moreover, we can argue all day about what live means, but for the regular person, live update means an update given during or immediately after an event. More on this later.

Second, Verafiles simply nitpicked the definition of government snipers.
Deogracias again went on to define what government snipers mean, essentially saying that the people involved are not snipers because they do not use sniper rifles. Deogracias was again caught up with technicality, as the regular dictionary meaning of a sniper is someone who shoots at people from a hidden position [Collins].

Yes, Deogracias may still insist on her jargon on the previous two points, but thats a pile of B.S. for regular readers because it goes against the principle of readability for journalistic work.

Third, Verafiles essentially claimed thate I said that there were orders to arrest Aznar, even if I didn't.
I am not sure where Deogracias got that info because the only ThinkingPinoy Facebook post that is about arrest is one that reads [FB]:
Mr. Aznar, let me remind you that Pres. Rody Duterte, on that same day, suspended the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao, so you can be arrested anytime - - even without a warrant - - for aiding and abetting the Maute Rebels, whether out of hatred for the administration, or out of sheer stupidity. So I suggest that you board the first flight out before some AFP general orders your arrest because trust me, you will be no hero in the eyes of Filipinos.
I do not know if the supposed veteran journalist has serious comprehension issues, but its clear that I said that the AFP legally has the option to arrest Aznar, and I made sure to say nothing about whether AFP will arrest him or not, as that would be usurpation of the authority of the AFP spokesperson, which can land me in jail for up to 10 years. Miss Deogracias, I am not as stupid as Undersecretary Joel Egco, who repeatedly usurped Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanars authority to issue press releases.

At this point, I have shown that the list facts that Deogracias checked are faulty at best, but lets pretend that everythings ok so far, and lets further examine her post.

That cute fact-check article
Deogracias tried to debunk my misrepresented claim of Aznars video post being a live feed by referring to file metadata, or those hidden pieces of information that are embedded in many computer files. Specifically, she cited that the video clips metadata indicates that it was created on 1:19 PM, i.e. the time when the file was transferred to the PC. Along with Aznars supposed claim that the actual footage was taken 19 minutes earlier, she immediately concluded that the clip in question was not uploaded until 73 minutes later or at 2:13 PM, or the timestamp on Aznars Instagram upload.
This methodology has several flaws.

First, synchronization of clocks.Let me note that Deogracias did not verify the Aznars clock is synchronized with Instagrams clock. That is, she did not verify if 1:19 PM on Aznars Macbook is also 1:19 PM on Instagram. That is, Deogracias simply assumed that they were synchronized.

Fine! Like Deogracias, lets assume that the time setting on Aznars devices are not significantly out-of-sync with Instagrams.

Second, authenticity of metadata.Deogracias took Aznars word as if its set on stone, even if its an established fact that Quicktime Movie metadata can be modified in various ways, one of which is through the QuickTime movie metadata editor. How sure is Deogracias that Aznar didnt tamper with evidence, especially since Aznar previously and surreptitiously attempted to tamper with evidence before.

Fine! Like Deogracias, lets pretend that all metadata in Aznars files are authentic.


More Metadata
At this point, I think its clear that theres Aznars word, theres mine, and theres metadata, so let me check whos lying based on the metadata of Aznars own files, evaluated using the following assumptions that Deogracias herself used:
The time setting on Aznars devices are not significantly out-of-sync with Instagrams.
All metadata in each of Aznars files are authentic.
Now, lets recall the background of Aznars controversial 17-second video that got mainstreams medias panties in a bunch:



Now, lets take a look at photos that Aznar took during the same event, photos that were uploaded to Getty Images, the stock photo agency that serves as one of Aznars monetization platforms.

Specifically, I went to GettyImages and searched for Aznars photos dated from 24 May 2017 to 26 May 2017. The search yielded a gallery of images that you can see by clicking here.
I took a hard look at the background of Aznars Instagram video, then I looked for Aznars photos in the Getty Image Gallery with the same background. I found seven images that appears to be taken in the same place as the video. Clicking on a photo creates a popup window where larger version of the photo appears.

The larger photo is watermarked with Jes Aznar, Getty Images, and its property/image ID.


The image below shows a thumbnail of these seven photos along with a snapshot of Aznars Instagram video. I labelled each photo with its corresponding property/image ID.


Deogracias article derives much of its supposed legitimacy through its citation of metadata, so I felt it proper to give Deogracias (and Aznar) a taste of their own medicine.

Lets get some bit of the metadata from the seven Aznar photos I mentioned in the previous section.

To do this, we use the Getty Images API tool.

How to use the Getty Images API Tool
STEP 1: Go to https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/ui/index#!/images/images_Get and register. After email confirmation, youll be given an API key.

STEP 2: Go back to to https://api.gettyimages.com/swagger/ui/index#!/images/images_Get, scroll down to Images, then click Show/Hide.

STEP 3: Click the bar that says Get metadata for a single image by supplying one image id.

STEP 4: Insert or type in the relevant image ID.

STEP 5: In the fields, tick the box for date_camera_shot. Ill tell you why later.

STEP 6: Click Try it out and the system should return something like this:


STEP 7: Do these steps for the following image IDs:

688223060
688224482
688224492
688224576
688224580
688224600
688227038

To make it easier for the reader, I created a simple table that shows the image IDs with corresponding metadata.



Translating Metadata to simpler terms

The field date_camera_shot is the time that the camera took the photo based on the cameras internal clock at the moment the photo was taken.

The time notation includes +00:00 or UTC+00. However, cameras do not really care about time zones, so if youre in the Philippines and you took a picture with the camera clock at 12 noon, the metadata will show 12:00:00+00:00, even if your actual time zone is +08:00, or UTC+08.


For example, the photo with Image ID 688224470 shows a van whose shadow is directly beneath it, suggesting that was taken at around noon.

Judging from the shadows, Aznar's 25 May 2017 photo with Image ID 688224470 must have been taken at around noon.
True enough, Image ID 688224470s metadata shows that it was taken on 2017-05-25T11:21:28+00:00, or at 11:21 AM of 25 May 2017. Moreover, 11:21 AM UTC+00 is equivalent to 7:21 PM Manila, and such a photo could not have been taken at nighttime.


Lets now simplify the table in the previous section by translating the time stamps to regular AM/PM format.


That is, we now see the times at which each of the seven photos were taken, photos whose backgrounds match that of Aznars Instagram video.

And yes, there something going on.

Photo Time Stamps belie Aznars claims
Aznar claimed the video, uploaded at 2:13 PM, was taken at around 1:00 PM while the troops, along with Aznar, were on the way out of the area. The problem, however, is that the time stamps of his Getty Images photos suggest otherwise, because they were all taken AFTER 2:00 PM.

Let me repeat: Aznar said they got out of the structure at 1:00 PM, yet there are photos taken after 2:00 that show soldiers present in the same structure. Moreover, these photos were taken by Aznar himself, so he was still in the structure at 2:50 PM, based on the timestamps of the seven photos.

Yes, some soldiers were still in the structure by 2:50 PM based on the timestamps, and Aznar uploaded the controversial video at 2:13 PM, suggesting that the soldiers whereabouts were exposed for 37 minutes before the earliest time that they could have gotten out of the structure.

Note that I sued date_camera_shot, which refers to the time that Aznar took the photos, NOT the time when he uploaded the photos to his Mac.

Hindi nakakatalino ang Mac, pramis.

TAGALUGIN KO HA?

Sabi ni Aznar, wala na sila doon sa building na hollow blocks na walang palitada ang pader by around 1 PM. Pero bakit may photos na may sundalo sa loob ng building at ang timestamp ay lagpas 2 PM? Meron pa ngang timestamp e 2:50 PM, o 37 minutes matapos i-upload ni Aznar ang video.

What the?!

Possible explanations for the discrepancies
There are two possibilities:

Aznar is lying.
Aznars devices are lying, i.e. are set incorrectly.

If Aznar is lying, then the debate is over. On the other hand, if Aznars devices are lying, then Verafiless fact check, which relies heavily on time stamps and gross misrepresentation, falls apart.

Will Verafiles insist that the timestamps on Aznars devices are reliable? If so, then that means Aznar lied to his teeth.

Will Verafiles insist that the timestamps on Aznars devices are unreliable? If so, then that means Verafiles are filled with amateurs, not veterans.

This is what happens with shoddy investigations, and I am confident that ""veteran journalist"" Deogracias can do better than this.

I was kidding on that last one.

The ""Veterans"" in Verafiles
What's most perplexing in this Verafiles article is the shoddy journalism from the supposedly veteran journalist Charmaine Deogracias. A little research, however, provides clues on why Verafiles allowed the publication of garbage likes this.

First, the Trillanes Link.
Verafiles President Ellen Tordesillas has very close ties with Senator Antonio Trillanes' Magdalo Party. Aside from having a close personal and professional relationship with Magdalo hacker Bem Pontejos, Tordesillas was instrumental in the BPI Julia Vargas Scandal, the same scandal where Trillanes accused then-presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte of amassing P211 million in ill-gotten wealth, with the only evidence being a pathetic excel printout.

On the other hand, Jes Aznar was the same person who sold the Matobato video to New York Times, so that means Aznar had access to Matobato PRIOR to the Senate Hearing.

Now, guess who Matobato's handler was? Sonny Trillanes.

Common friends, common interests.

Second, they are not very techie.
Well, Verafiles president isn't very techie to begin with, as I have demonstrated in ""Sonny Trillanes and his Hacker-friend"". In that article, I showed that Verafiles president Tordesillas knows little about technology (she didn't even have domain privacy for her blog!), so I guess Deogracia's editors are unlikely to notice that Charmaine has been spewing garbage lately.

Third, a history of subversion
The original post I made about the Aznar video was about one simple thing: journalists should know when to get out the way to prevent exposing our soldiers to additional, unnecessary risks. But judging from court records, that's something that Verafiles ""fact checker"" Charmaine Deogracias disagrees with.

Let's take a look at Deogracias et. Al. vs Sec. Puno et. Al [PCIJ].

In one 2007 morning, Sen. Trillanes and and the Magdalo Group walked out of the Makati City Regional Trial Court, marched toward the nearby Manila Peninsula hotel,took over it and called for the President Arroyo's ouster.

Later in the afternoon, the PNP attempted to serve an arrest warrant against Trillanes. The PNP also demanded that journalists covering the event should leave the hotel right away. Many cleared the premises but Tordesillas and Deogracias, among others, defied the PNP's order.

Smells like obstruction of justice, aside from major ka-epalan, to me. Nevertheless, it appears that Tordesillas, Deogracias and Aznar, are cut from the same cloth.

I would've love to write more about this, I guess I'll stop here.

Magsama-sama na lang silang apat ni Trillanes.

Hindi ko na ipu-proofread. Hindi sulit.

A Traitor in Malacaang? Media Security Usec. Egco usurps Sec. Andanars authority,"Usec. Egco, the Filipino People shall not allow the Presidential Task Force on Media Security to become a tool of the Media Cartel.

Earlier today, the Presidential Task Force on Media Security (PTFoMS) released a June 22 press statement saying mainstream media (Big Media) raised concern over security (sic) of Jes Aznar, who has been covering the ongoing conflict in Marawi.

The PTFoMS press release [TP: PTFoMS statement] essentially parroted the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines hyper-partisan statement of condemnation against ThinkingPinoy, a statement that the latter has conclusively addressed in a June 20 ThinkingPinoy article TP: NUJPs Condemnation: Jes Aznar, Marawi Siege, and Matobato.
The PTFoMS, however, went even further when it said:
To debunk rumors and fake news, the Philippine National Police, a member of the Task Force, said it has not served a warrant of arrest to Aznar.
What the hell is Big Media talking about? Nobody said theres a warrant against Aznar.

The Imaginary Demonic Strawman
Big Media essentially created a demon by misrepresenting my statements, which was that the Armed Forces has the option to arrest Aznar for endangering our troops in Marawi. Its one thing to say that the AFP has the option, and its a totally different thing to say that the AFP will indeed exercise it.

The problem, however, is that PR-operators-turned-journalists, such as Bubby Dacer protg Inday Espina-Varona [FB: Varona], echoed this imaginary accusation as if its some Bible Truth.


To make matters worse, PTFoMS Usec. Joel Egco, a presidential appointee and former president of the National Press Club [MT], allowed himself to be used as the exorcist of this imaginary demon, as I pointed this out in a strongly-worded June 22 statement addressed to Usec. Egco [TP: Egco].

The PTFoMS essentially allowed itself to be used by Big Media to forward its desperate agenda of de-legitimizing independent social media publishers like me, at a time when Big Media companies continue to lose influence as their social media engagement figures continue to dwindle [TP: Media Wars; Facebook Insights].

Published using the agencys official letterhead, the PTFoMS statement is curiously unsigned, which is uncharacteristic of official press statements from the government.

Theres something fishy going on.

Who issues PTFoMS statements?
The Presidential Task Force on Media Security exists by virtue of President Rodrigo Dutertes Administrative Order No. 1, entitled Creating the Presidential Task Force on Violations of the Right to Life, Liberty and Security of the Members of the Media [GovPH].

According to A.O. 1, Section 5:
SECTION 5. The Presidential Task Force Spokesperson. The Secretary of the PCOO alone shall be authorized to make public statements on matters concerning the activities of the Presidential Task Force. Unless otherwise ordered by the Secretary of the PCOO, the Executive Director may also make public pronouncements but only on matters related to the administrative functions of the Presidential Task Force.
A.O. 1 Sec. 5 categorically states that PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar ALONE is allowed by law to issue public statements, save for administrative functions. However, the June 22 PTFoMS press statement is not about an administrative function.
The problem, however, is that it is not in Sec. Andanars character to issue such kinds of statements, so it appears that somebody may have usurped the PCOO secretarys authority.

In response to an inquiry on the matter, Sec. Andanar said:
For the record I was not aware about Usec. Egco's press release (and) There was no one from PCOO during the deliberation of Egco et. Al.
Situations like these are precisely the reason why AO 1 Sec. 5 exists. Every press statement that the PCOO releases goes through a meticulous vetting and approval process to make sure that it is in consonance with the directives of the President.

However, it appears that one or a few overeager people inside PTFoMS wants to take over Andanars responsibilities, something that is not only unethical, but also illegal.

Egco does a Pontius Pilate
The bigger problem? AO 1, plus the statements styling, makes it appear that it was Andanar who issued the statement, which is NOT the case.

Alright, its time to contact Egco.

I contacted Usec. Egco to clarify the matter. Present in the conversation was a social media officer (SMO) of the PCOO, so if Egco disputes any of the following quotes, that SMO can confirm if they're true or simply made up.

Egco: Two nights ago, dinala ng NUJP sa Task Force yung tungkol kay Aznar. Finorward ko kay (PCOO Asec) yung complaint ng NUJP talagang ire-raise nila. You know what I did? Ayan, nakikita ni (SMO) ha? Sabi ko kay (PCOO Asec), puwede nating gawin is hindi tamaan si TP.

I reminded Usec. Egco of AO 1 Sec 5 then said that any statement from the Task Force shall be construed as coming from Sec. Andanar.

TP: Lets not kid ourselves. Hindi man ako pinangalan dito, ako pinatatamaan nito. At ngayong binasa ng readers ko ang statement, alam nilang ako yon. So ang tanong lang po, sir, inallow ba kayo ni Secretary Andanar na i-publish ito?

Egco: RJ, Id like to clarify. Eto ha please believe me and you can verify from sources not a single period, not a single dot (in the statement was from me).

Egco goes full Pontius Pilate
TP: So let me ask you sir. You consulted with NPC, NUJP, lahat na yon. Why did you not consult me?

Egco: It was a meeting. Noong pinag-uusapan yung kay Aznar, I was outside. Noong pumasok ako, sabi ko, Ano na yung agenda? It was not my decision.
TP: So whose decision was it to publish the statement?

Egco: It was the decision of the entire body, RJ You have to be there in the meeting to (fully appreciate the facts) Theres an urgency, according to them.

TP: Then why didnt you call me? Im awake 19 hours a day.

Egco: RJ, please, ganito ha, trust me

TP: Eh sir, you cannot say that I should just trust you. Lets talk professionally here Whats clear here is that... it was referring to the issue that I have with NUJP. My article two days ago reached one million hits. (Practically) the entire Philippines knows about it.

Egco: Actually, ako mismo, hindi ko nakita ang post ni Aznar, hindi ko nakita yung banatan niyo o yung ah reaction mo don. Believe me, hindi.

TP: So why did you allow this to be published e wala pala sa inyo lahat ng info?

Egco: Decision yon ng body If were going to do this, if were going to do that. If youre going to ask me, ako siyempre, ayoko. Alright? But I have to ask the body, its a collective decision... to issue the statement na walang sisisihin

I begged to differ, and I started reading to him the PTFoMS press statement, then he interjected.
Egco: Sabi nila (the press), there are memes with a picture daw ni Jes Aznar at nakalagay Maute Supporter coming from many mga ganon... kako hindi ko nakikita but kung ganoong kadelikado If he needs police protection, Ill provide it.

I searched both [Twitter] and [Facebook] for such memes.

NONE WENT VIRAL. Yes, the PTFoMS essentially condemned social media even if the evidence is imaginary.

Egco exculpates Andanar
Egco: Sabi nila, Hindi, yung mga threats ng mga oo e nung mga netizens, no? Not you! In fact, hindi binanggit ang pangalan mo. Yung mga netizens grabe na The one who was doing all the talking yesterday was Joe Torres yung representative ng NPC.

At this point, it appears to me that the mainstream journalists are actually commandeering the PTFoMS meeting, in violation of AO 1 Sec 2, which states that the media organizations serve only as resource persons and observers.

TP: Noong naglabas kayo ng press statement, ang template na ginamit ninyo, nakalagay, Chairman Aguirre, Co-chairman Andanar, Executive Director ikaw po Hindi po rito sinasabi na ang nagsulat pala nito ay yung mga journalists na yan. Pag nilabas itong statement na ito sir, pangalan ninyo, ni Andanar, at ni Aguirre ang nakasalpak dito.

Egco: Ah, hindi kasi, iyan yung official letterhead ng Task Force May imprimatur yan ng Task Force, not me.

TP: Eto sir, categorical na lang po. Correct me if Im wrong. Yes or no lang po. Did Martin allow this?

Egco: He was not there yesterday. Ang represented doon, DoJ was there So si Sec Martin, ano Si

TP: So Sec. Martin is out of this?

Egco: Yes, yes, yes. He is, he is, he is (out of this).

Thus, its as clear as day that the PTFoMS issued a statement despite Andanar having the sole authority to issue such.

TP: Saan po bang part ng Administrative Order 1 nag-a-allow ng exceptions to the rule (na si Sec. Martin lang ang puwedeng mag-issue ng mga statements? You see, mainstream media has been screaming, Rule of Law! Rule of Law! for the past year, and this is what the Rule of Law dictates. So gusto ko lang po kailangan ko lang ang enabling law which allows that body to bypass AO 1, to bypass the orders of the President.

Egco: We did not actually bypass SMMA (Andanar) Of course, andoon ang chair, andoon ang lahat, everybody there, making the policy kasi e kumbaga, kung ako masusunod, RJ, of course, ayokong mag-release ng kung anu-ano. 

Statement released despite Andanars absence
TP: So bakit niyo ni-release?

Egco: Iyon kasi ang decision ng body.

TP: Sabihin na natin na powerless kayo sa decision (ng PTFoMS as a whole) If were to sue someone for violating the Revised Penal Code, should I be suing you, or should I be suing them?

Egco: E I think its the decision of the Task Force kasi Ganito kasi, pag nakita mo yung mga statements ko before, may reference yon if it was my own statement, na ipapaalam ko kay Secretary.
TP: Ang issue ko dito, did we follow the law in the issuance of this statement? Kasi we can argue all day about whats ethical and whats not e kaya lang, magde-deadlock lang tayo don. So the question boils down to who violated what (law).

Egco: Sa issuance non, dahil decision nga yon ng entire body


TP: O sige sir, I think Ive heard your side and Ill take your word for what it is, and Ill just do what I can do from my end. Kasi sir, social media publishers are not very happy with what he task force did. So.. ehh.. ganun talaga.

Egco: We will issue a clarificatory ano

TP: Naku sir, e kumonsulta ka muna kay Sec. Martin magtu-two counts ka ng (Usurpation of Authority).

Egco and SMO laughed.

TP: E totoo di ba? Magtu-two counts ka. 

To clarify the issue, I have lodged an eFoI request for documents revising Administrative Order No. 1 Section 5 [eFoI]. In the request's description, I specifically said:
I would like to request for any document issued after the October 2016 issuance of Administrative Order No. 1 that effectively amends AO 1 Sec. 5, or the clause that reserves solely to the PCOO Secretary the authority to issue non-administrative public statements on behalf of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security (PTFoMS).
I would like to know if there are any subsequently-issued law or regulation that enables anyone other than the PCOO Sec. to serve as PTFoMS spokesperson or to execute all or part of the PTFoMS spokesperson's responsibilities as detailed in AO 1 Sec 5.

FoI request for documents revising of AO 1 Sec 5


The Legal Issues
Before I cite potential violations of existing laws, let me state for the record that Egcos ignorance of Administrative Order No. 1, the exact same document that created his position, is alarming. Should we entrust media security to someone who does not have a clear understanding of what his Executive Director position entails, of what he can and cannot do?

President Duterte, please rethink this particular appointment.

Now, lets move on to the legal issues. I consulted with my lawyer-friends to analyze the situation, and this is what we have come up with, so far. Note that his is not an exhaustive list of possible violations, but a mere preview of what may happen should anyone pursue legal remedies.

Also note that I have lodged an FoI request for the resolutions issued during the meetings related to the controversial TPFoMS press statement. I also requested for the attendance during those meetings and if possible, the minutes of the meeting that are relevant to the issue at hand [eFoI]. 

FoI request for PTFoMS documents
So now, lets go.

1: Grave Abuse of Discretion
The hastily issued PTFoMS press statement, in consideration of the surrounding circumstances and the mention of my name in the NUJP complaint from which it was based, is clearly a violation of my constitutional right to due process, a right that every veteran journalist, like Usec and former National Press Club president Egco, should be totally aware of.

As PTFoMS executive director, Egcos tasks include ensuring that all applicable laws, rules, and regulations are followed in everything that PTFoMS does, and that includes ensuring that I, along with all the social media users referred to by the NUJP complaint, be given the benefit of due process.

Egco willfully neglected to even attempt to conduct an investigation into the complaint. Egco willfully decided not to raise this issue during the PTFoMS meeting and thus allowed the PTFoMS to issue a blanket indictment of social media users for an accusation with no supporting evidence.

Egco did not even bother to contact me  or anyone else in Social Media  for the other side of the issue, effectively abridging our right to Free Speech.

This amounts to the administrative violation of Grave Abuse of Discretion [BatasNatin] that may be considered grounds for his dismissal from his government position.


2: Violation of Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act
Despite this, Usec. Egco allowed the illegal issuance of the PTFoMS press statement, in violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act [RA 3019], the relevant part of which reads:
Causing any undue injury to any party in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence
The issuance of the illegal press statement is meant as an attempt not only to intimidate me and other social media users, but also to cause injury to my reputation when Egco, as the Executive Director of the PTFoMS, demonstrated manifest partiality in favor of the Big Media complainants.

Why manifest partiality?

Because social media publishers, by all means, are also media workers. Thus, it is within the PTFoMS mandate to protect social media publishers like me, just like how it protects mainstream journalists. Despite this, Egco decided to side with Big Media, to the detriment of social media publishers like ThinkingPinoy.

I am an independent blogger. But just like mainstream journalists from Big Media, my success relies heavily on the goodwill of people, i.e. my reputation.

Unfortunately, the complainant NUJP, along with Big Media in general, possibly out of insecurity arising from its dwindling influence, has been attacking the reputation of independent publishers like me, as evidenced by NUJPs injudicious and capricious use of the term fake news to refer to the work of independent publishers.

Thus, a  rift exists between Big Media, where NUJP belongs, and Independent Media, where I and many other social media publishers identify with. And in this case, Egco demonstrated manifest partiality in favor of the former.

The illegally-issued PTFoMS, in consideration of the surrounding circumstances, caused injury to my reputation. i.e. injury to property, as it has been argued that by legal scholars that reputation may be considered property in virtual economies [Blocher 2009].

Relevant clauses of RA 3019 provides the penalty of imprisonment for 6-15 years and perpetual disqualification from public office for this violation.

3: Usurpation of Authority or Official Functions
Administrative Order No. 1, Section 5, categorically states that PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar has the sole power to issue PTFoMS statements that are not administrative in nature. Despite this, Egco effectively authorized the issuance of a non-administrative June 22 press release, thereby usurping the authority vested to Sec. Andanar and Sec. Andanar alone.

In light of AO 1, the illegally issued press statement, which bears no signatures, shall be construed by the public as a document whose legitimacy emanates from the person authorized to issue it, i.e. Secretary Andanar.

But we all know Andanar had nothing to do with the said document.

That is, Egco allowed the issuance of the press statement, a statement that per AO 1 gives the impression that it was Andanar who issued it, despite the fact that the latter did not.

Egco violated Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code [RPC], the relevant part of which reads:
Art. 177. Usurpation of authority or official functions.  Any person who shall under pretense of official position, shall perform any act pertaining to any public officer of the Philippine Government without being lawfully entitled to do so, shall suffer the penalty of prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods.
Note that Republic Act No. 10 increases Article 177s penalties to imprisonment for 2 to 10 years [RA 10]

Moreover and despite multiple reminders, Egco admitted to having issued another PTFoMS press release after the one in question, thus constituting a second violation (second count) of the abovementioned law.

I thought it was going to end there, but let me restate Egcos earlier statement:
Ganito kasi, pag nakita mo yung mga statements ko before, may reference yon if it was my own statement, na ipapaalam ko kay Secretary.
The problem in Egcos defense is that, with or without Andanars permission, he still has no authority to issue non-administrative statements. There is no enabling law that allows him to do so. Thus, Egco may have been violated RPC Art 177 multiple times even before this brouhaha happened.

In line with this, I have lodged a Freedom of Information request for the list of all public statements issued by Usec. Egco since he took office in October 2016, where the list should identify which of the statements are administrative in nature, and which are not [eFoI].

Pending FoI request for List of Public Statements issued by Usec. Egco
On a Final Note
This entire hullabaloo is a direct affront to my security as a social media publisher, something that falls totally within the mandate of Egcos Presidential Task Force on Media Security. That is, aside from lodging administrative and criminal complaints, President Dutertes Administrative Order No. 1 also entitles me not only to protection from the Task Force on Media Security, but also to lodging a complaint to the Task Force itself.

Hindi ba nakakatawa na ang complaint kong ila-lodge sa Task Force ay laban sa Task Force?
Daddy D, tanggalin mo na yan diyan. Mas maraming mas kwalipikado -- at mas may loyalty -- kaysa kay Usec. Egco.

Kung ang simpleng pagbabasa lang, pag intindi at pakikipagusap sa lahat ng involved ay hindi niya magawa. Kailangan siya palitan at managot sa mga paglabag niya.

So, USec. Egco, are my writings accurate, or should I issue a clarificatory statement just like you did?

"NUJPs condemnation: Jes Aznar, Marawi Siege, and Matobato","In a statement published earlier today, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) condemned this writer, R.J. Nieto who goes by the nom de plume ThinkingPinoy, for endangering a journalist because of a mistaken accusation [NUJP].


NUJP issued this statement of condemnation without contacting me, which I find ironic because the Second National Congress of the NUJP itself adopted and endorsed the Principles and Premises on the Press in 1991. Specifically, the 1991 document enjoins media practitioners to comply with the 1966 International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which includes the right to a fair trial [UN].

But we are talking about NUJP, where five of its nine board members are from Inquirer and ABS-CBN, so I sincerely am unsurprised.

Regardless, to clarify the issue, let me give you a chronology of what transpired in the ongoing TP-Aznar saga.

Aznar and NUJP
According to NUJP, I accused Aznar of posting real time photos of soldiers battling the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups in Marawi City, thereby possibly giving away their positions and endangering their lives.

NUJP, despite being filled with professional journalists, got the accusation wrong. The material-in-question was a video clip and not just a photo.

On a June 16 Facebook post, I wrote:
""NYtimes/Inq photographer Jes Aznar posts live updates from Marawi, revealing the positions of government snipers to any terrorist with a smartphone. Tang ina, tanggalin niyo yang idiota na yan dyan! (H*ly sh*t, get that idiot out of there!)
Aznar uploaded that video with the original caption: Flushing out an enemy sniper. In the middle of fighting in #Marawi #Philippines, without stating the time it was taken.
A screenshot of Aznar's original video post, before he edited the caption.
Now, tell me Mr. Aznar, how would in the middle of fighting be construed?

In one of the chat threads on his Facebook account and before issuing any formal statement, Aznar said the video was taken over three weeks ago and it was a late post. He was vague about the exact time it was taken, and the exact time it was uploaded.
Aznar then attempted to tamper with the evidence by surreptitiously editing his Instagram post, adding the hashtag #lateupload, among others.
Aznar inserted ""Not a live feed #latepost"" after being called out.
I also called this out so Aznar, again, edited the caption to include the term EDIT:.
FINALLY.
Good. He thought hed get away with it.

Now, is a video taken just less than five hours before posting qualify as a #latepost? 

I do not think so.

Aznars defense
The main point of contention in NUJPs statement is that Aznars claim that the video wasnt a live feed.  However, when a regular citizen like me says live update, I meant information about an event that is posted on, or immediately after, the event. Both Aznar and NUJP used the phrase Live Feed, a term that I never used.

NUJP and Aznar can attempt to take refuge on semantic nitpicking all they want, but whats clear is that available information clearly shows that the video was posted just a few hours after it was taken.

Aznar then issued a lengthier, seemingly more formal reply.

In a June 17 post, Aznar wrote, The post is a screengrab of my Instagram post in Marawi more than three weeks ago, then [ThinkingPinoy claimed] it as a live feed of a military maneuver.

Aznar then went on to threaten me with a lawsuit, a lawsuit that I will gladly welcome with a countersuit.
Aznar's June 17 Threat


NUJP's Extra-passionate Condemnation
I find it interesting that NUJP wrote this condemnation with a passion, and I think I know the reason why.

In his post, Aznar clarified that he works neither for the Philippine Daily Inquirer nor the New York Times, although he admitted that his works are regularly published in the New York Times. Note, however, that an Inquirer article with his name on the byline exists [Inq]. I guess the more appropriate term, vis--vis Aznars relationship with the Inquirer, is worked.
With that said, its interesting to point out that four out of the nine NUJP board members, along with its president, are from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Aznars former business associates. 
NUJP's president and four of its nine board members are from the Inquirer. Inquirer is affiliated with the New York Times.

Moreover, Inquirer is affiliated with Aznar's primary business associate New York Times, as the Inquirer republishes NY Times articles through its subdomain ""newyorktimes.inquirer.net"".


Well, ""protect your own"", right? Mr. Aznar, it's the same banana.


Soldiers out of the area means nothing
Aznar claims to be a professional photojournalist, so its safe to say that he went to Marawi with a mobile internet service ready. Surely, no self-respecting journalist will go to a war zone then look for a SIM card seller there.

Aznars first ever Instagram post [IG] about Marawi was also on May 25th, suggesting that he arrived in the area on May 25th. Moreover, another Instagram photo of his shows a soldier in the same background and captioned This was taken as I arrive near ground zero.

This was taken three weeks ago, as I arrive near ground zero of the fighting between government troops and the Maute group who has taken control over the city armed with high-powered guns and RPGs. Snipers firing on our position. Fighting is still ongoing as of today. #philippines #mindanao #marawi #photojournalism #everydayphilippines #everydayeverywhere #terror #battle
A post shared by JES AZNAR (@jeszmann) on Jun 14, 2017 at 7:06pm PDT

Yes, he arrived in Marawi on May 25th.

Aznars controversial video was posted at 6:13 AM UTC, which translates to 2:13 PM Manila. Judging by the amount of sunlight in the video, along with the length of the shadows outside the structure, the photo must have been taken around noon of that day, i.e. between 9:00 AM and 2:13 PM.

In short, Aznar posted that video that was less than five hours old when it was uploaded. It was just the second day of fighting, and enemies are all over the place, so that Armed Forces personnel could not have gotten too far from where the video was taken.

The Issues
Aznar uploaded two videos, with the second video, uploaded at 3:21 PM Manila based on its metadata, shown below:
Street by street. House by house #Marawi #martiallaw #mindanao #philippines #photojournalism #terror #isis EDIT: NOT A LIVE FEED #latepost
A post shared by JES AZNAR (@jeszmann) on May 25, 2017 at 12:21am PDT
Now, let me raise a few issues connected with Aznars videos.

First, any Maute Group member with a smartphone and mobile internet can discover Aznars videos and easily pinpoint the area where theres military presence, given the formers uncanny familiarity with Marawis geography. The Maute members engaged in the firefight wont have to worry about contacting their headquarters. Why? Because Aznar already did it for them. Now, what if they sent reinforcements in response to this information?

Surely, a group that managed to smuggle mind-boggling amounts of military equipment knows how to use Instagram. Marawi is part of the terrorist group ISIS, and ISIS has been known in as early as 2015 to use this platform [TheVerge].

Second, the video provides information about the militarys entry points. Now that it has been revealed to the enemy, will the AFP be able to use that entry point again? This forces the AFP to either (a) look for new alternative entry points or  be content with one less entry point. In short, Aznars video could have made the AFPs mission tougher than it should be.

Third, and I think this is self-evident given the previous point: AFP snipers cannot use that spot anymore, leaving AFP with fewer sniping spots. Again, Aznars video could have made the AFPs mission tougher than it should be. Is it in the interest of the public to make the AFPs odds of winning the war slimmer by any measure?

Lastly, the previous two posts assume that the AFP was able to discover the video shortly after it was uploaded. But what if it did not? That is, who among those soldiers featured in the video are still alive? Or more importantly, how many soldiers could have been injured or killed because of the information in the videos?

And these are just off the top of my head. How much more for military tacticians with the requisite training and more up-to-date information on the ground?
Yes, the operative word here is could and may, and NUJP and Aznar can argue all day that their posts are unlikely to have caused any of the ones mentioned above.

In fact, NUJP said Aznar said that he only had good intentions in posting the photo on his Facebook social media account, such as showing the public how active the government troops were in quelling the Maute and Abu Sayyaf.


The road to hell is paved with good intentions. The decision on whats OK and whats not OK is neither for NUJP nor for Aznar to make: its for the AFPs.

But Aznar decided to post that video clip anyway, with so many hashtags that are reminiscent of social media users who crave for attention.

Aznar and the Victim Card
After his lengthy passive-aggressive I-am-the-victim-here reply, I issued a counter-statement that quickly went viral [TP]. The post has garnered over 11,000 reactions, has been shared over 4900 times, and has reached over a million Facebook users.

In that statement, I advised Aznar to get out of Mindanao as soon as possible, as the AFP, empowered by the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, may opt to arrest him for violating their May 24th instruction for civilians to ""refrain from posting in social media information that would exacerbate the situation [EDGE].""

After all, if I were an AFP general, Id rather detain a reporter than risk both his life and my men by letting the reporter freely take full advantage of his idiocy.

I ended the counter-statement with the following:
Yes, this is unsolicited advice from someone you called an idiot. That is how kind I am. Isipin mo nga, di ko na kinuwento yung binenta mong video sa NYtimes last year. Pero sige, humala ka pa, and I'll make you a household name. (Imagine, I didnt even tell people about the video you sold to New York Times last year. But continue with your antics, and Ill make you a household name). Yes, Jes, that's fear you're feeling right now. That is fear.
I checked all my posts about Aznar and this is the only threat I issued. I do not understand how this threat could be construed as illegal, especially since I exercised restraint on my part by not divulging information that could make him one of the most hated persons in the country.


So how, exactly, did I endanger Aznars life? Is it because of the flak he got from netizens, the deluge of criticisms that forced him to turn off commenting on both his Instagram and Facebook profiles?

No, I did not ""endanger"" Aznar's life. I simply bruised his ego. Big time.

Aznar, the war correspondent
Aznar, after receiving so many negative comments, set his post to private and started deleting most, if not all of them, then put the privacy settings back to public. Despite that cowardice, I agree that there have been comments on his thread, posted by other netizens, that involve threats.

I do not condone illegal behavior, especially if it involves the issuances of threats to life and to national security. Thats the exact reason why I was livid when I reacted to Aznars post, as his video could have unnecessarily put the lives of our brave soldiers at greater risk. Thats also the reason why I called out Rappler when it endangered national security by leaking confidential information when I was covering Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetanos press conference in Moscow, Russia.

However, how people react to to information is not within my control, and I believe it's infantile for both Aznar and NUJP (a.k.a. Inquirer) to blame me for the actions of other people.

Truth be told, if Aznar exercised some humility in his statements and refrained from blatantly displaying arrogance and self-entitlement, the public would've responded very differently, perhaps even favorably.

The problem, however, is he did not, as shown below:



Now, common sense dictates a blatant show of arrogance against someone with over 500,000 followers will probably result in those 500,000 feeling a sense of revulsion against you. That is human nature, you idiot, so don't come to your NUJP overlord crying for help, because that won't change the situation.

Besides, Mr. Aznar, sans the death threats, I do not personally care about you or your well-being. That's your problem.


It's the well-being of our brave soldiers that I truly care about. You know, the ones whose success really counts.

But let's make it simpler:

The safety of our soldiers is more important than your ego.

Aznar takes pride in his self-proclaimed bravery, being a war correspondent in the Marawi Siege. Thus, I do not understand how Aznar, who takes pride in dodging live bullets, could be intimidated by social media comments which, as one ex-PR lady puts it, is just manufactured noise.

I expect a seasoned war correspondent to be tougher than that: the Filipino People deserve better than just the likes of Aznar.

Photojournalists do their work best when behind the camera. Stay behind it. Pabida ka kasi masyado.

To make matters more comical, Aznar even cried for help from NUJP. Why comical? Because he asked for help from an organization that has already lost its credibility [TP: NUJP Officers], and has a very weak following.

NUJP has fewer than 10,000 followers for crying out loud!

The Threat
Since were at it, let me restate the only threat that I issued against Aznar:
Pero sige, humala ka pa, and I'll make you a household name. (Imagine, I didnt even tell people about the video you sold to New York Times last year. But continue with your antics, and Ill make you a household name)
Lets me do just that.

On 14 September, self-confessed hitman Edgar Matobato testified in the senate that he was part of Pres. Rodrigo Dutertes alledged Davao Death Squads [Yahoo]. Those who watched the senate hearing questioned Matobatos credibility after he claimed, among others, to have killed someone in a McDonalds Hotel, a non-existent place.

Less than 24 hours after that testimony, the New York Times published a video interview, featuring Matobato as he tells an interview basically the same things he told the senate. The problem, however, is that the statements he said here are inconsistent with the ones he said in the senate hearing.

For example, Matobato told the Senate he killed four of Speaker Nograles bodyguards. But in the NY Times video, he said he killed five.

The New York Times failure to vet the problematic source is a problem in itself, but whats more alarming is the timing of the videos publication.

On a post, De La Salle University Professor Antonio Contreras said, See. This is a concerted effort. Barely a day after his testimony, a ready video-taped interview, with translations and subtitles are already available.

Now, who shot that video and sold it to NY Times? Jes Aznar.

Aznar, the sellout
Have we heard Aznar speaking out about the inconsistencies in Matobatos testimony? Despite his involvement in the international demolition of the Philippines reputation, the answer is No.

Whats worse, Aznar sold the video to a foreign newspaper, which opened the Philippines to foreign interference even before the senate hearing, which should be proper venue.

Aznar has also provided the New York Times with most of the unflattering photos it used in its coverage of the Duterte Administration.

New York Times reporter for Southeast Asia Richard Paddock has written the most about the administration, and most, if not all of his articles, contain material bought from Aznar [Google].

Surely, Aznar could not have simply emailed them the photos and left the NY Times writers to their own devices. As a photojournalist, he must have given NY Times the context behind each and every photo he sold them.

So, let me ask, what kind of context has Aznar been feeding Paddock? Surely, fairer contexts wouldve resulted in a less slanted articles from Paddock. Is Aznar actively espousing the destabilization of this government in the name of ambition?

Mr. Aznar, I have more information here. Do you seriously want to go that route?

I have bigger fish to fry, Mr. Aznar, so stop crying.

And NUJP, please. No one listens to you anymore. If you simply resort to trial by publicity, I am pretty confident that your audience is smaller than you would like to believe.

File a lawsuit, any of you. Make this worth my while.

Aznar, you're probably a hero to your 13 followers. But for the vast majority of Filipinos, you are not.",RJ Nieto,"June 20, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/06/nujp-condemns-jes-aznar-marawi-matobato.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"After Resorts World Tragedy, Rappler cements rep as fake news","After its disastrous coverage of the Resorts World tragedy, Maria Ressa's EQ and IQ are on full display as she desperately does PR damage control for Rappler, her baby project.

In January 2017, college sorority blog Rappler libeled Sass Sasot, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar, and me, RJ Nieto a.k.a. ThinkingPinoy. Written by Rapplerettes Chay Hofilena, SPO4 Pia Ranada-Robles, and Paige whatshername, the article Inside Martin Andanars Mancave accuses Sasot and I of accepting bribes from Andanar [Rappler].

Knowing full well that the article is nothing but hogwash, I wrote a rebuttal a day later, where I essentially asked why Rapplers editorial team allowed the publication of an article that cites an anonymous source without even asking for our side, in total contravention to established guidelines in journalistic ethics [TP: Chays Delusions].

As it turns out, one of the articles writers, SPO4 Pia Ranada-Robles, has a pending Freedom of Information request lodged on 19 January 2017, about a week before the articles publication. Entitled List of PCOO expenses, delegation for President Duterte's Singapore and China visits. Specifically, Ranada requested, among others [FoI]:
[The] List of names of the entire PCOO delegation to the Singapore and China trips, including consultants or bloggers who PCOO arranged to join the trips The list of expenses should include expenses for consultants who rendered services for the PCOO during these trips. They should include exact amounts spent on specific expenses.
PCOO approved SPO4s request fifteen workings days later on 09 February 2017, in accordance with the FoI executive orders implementing rules and regulations [FoI].

Its bad enough that Rappler never bothered to wait for the document, but what makes matters worse is that the document, which Ranada-Robles herself requested, showed that NOT A SINGLE CENT OF PUBLIC MONEY WAS PAID TO SASOT AND ME.
PCOO approved SPO4 Ranada's FoI request

That is, aside from citing nothing but anonymous source and despite official documents pointing to the contrary, Rappler defamed Andanar, Sasot, and I, with a deliberate and reckless disregard for the truthfulness for their claims.

What is Fake News?
An operational definition of Fake News can be culled from from the [Merriam-Webster] article The Real Story of Fake News. From that article, we can deduce:
Fake news refers to a spurious story which is seen as damaging to an agency, entity, or person.
Now, did you know that Ranada-Robles very conveniently forgot to report the results of her January FoI request? That makes Rapplers Inside Martin Andanars Mancave fake news, for the reason that SPO4 insists on peddling its lies despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary.

Four months later, Ranada-Robles and the Rapplerettes still fail to rectify the error. Just last week, I chanced upon Ranada-Robles as she was strolling in Moscow during Pres. Dutertes Official Visit to Russia, an event that were both covering.
I approached her and asked, Hi Pia! Kailan mo ako iinterviewhin? (Hi Pia, when will you interview me?, to which she replied, Kailan ka na hindi magiging fake news? (When will you stop being fake news [sic]?).

Yes, my friends, thats how deluded Maria Ressas Rapplerettes are. And if delusion had a face, it would look like this:
SPO4 Ranada-Robles, Chay Hofilea, and Paige whatshername, seem to have learned from the best: Her Royal Highness Maria Ressa, Rapplers Ultimate Fake News Generator.

Ressa and the Resorts World Manila Attack
Not content with feloniously leaking classified diplomatic communications, Maria Ressa very recently engaged in fearmongering that is not unlikely to have increased the death toll in the 02 June 2017 attack on Resorts World Manila (RWM), which claimed the lives of 22 RWM guests and RWM 13 employees [CNN], all of whom reportedly died from asphyxiation.

At 2:15 a.m. of 02 June 2017, or just a couple of hours from when the attacker started the onslaught, Rappler reported that ISIS claims responsibility for the RWM attack.

Its bad enough that Rappler prematurely released dubious information, but what made it even worse is the article titles wording.

The original title, ISIS claims responsibility for Resorts World Manila Casino Attack, failed to reflect the fact that the ISIS claim was just an opinion from a person from the other side of the planet. The title made it appear that Rappler itself saw ISIS claim the attack, even if its just Rita Katz who said they did [TP]. The articles title was later changed, rather sneakily, into ISIS 'Filipino operative' behind Resorts World Manila attack  SITE.
Rappler's original article title
In the article, Rappler cited Agence France Press who cited Rita Katz of SITE Intelligence Group who cited an anonymous ""Marawi Contact"". By virtue of a single anonymous source, despite the information being double hearsay, and despite ISIS tendency to claim responsibility for tragedies that they have nothing to do with, Rappler decided that its in the publics best interest to tag the ongoing RWM tragedy as a terrorist attack, despite the risks it entails on those still stranded inside the RWM building.
A Quick Timeline

How could Rapplers sloppy and premature reporting have affected the RWM situation?

Well, lets briefly chronicle the first several events.

At 12:07 a.m., the RWM attacker arrived at the premises. He entered the RWM building a few minutes later then fired a few warning shots, which prompted an evacuation and a call for police back up [GMA].
At 1:10 a.m., the first exchange of gunfire occurred [GMA].
At 1:37 a.m., a fire alert was issued [CNN].
At 1:46 a.m., the assailant made his way to the 5th floor, where he forcibly entered a room. He went out once to burn linen along the hallway [GMA].
At 2:02 a.m., RWM was put on lockdown [CNN], which is an emergency measure in which people are temporarily prevented from entering or leaving the building [MW]
At 2:15 a.m., Rappler published the abomination ISIS claims responsibility for Resorts World Manila casino attack, and it was the first (and only) local news site that reported such.

Ok, let me stop right there.

Consequences of sloppy journalism
RWM was put on lockdown at 2:02 a.m., so its impossible for anyone to get out of the building.

We have here a lone gunman rampaging through the gigantic RWM building, so its safe to say that many in the building were still unaware of the situation. If I were inside RWM, locked-down, and clueless, the logical thing to do would be to whip out my smartphone and check for news on social media.


Through news outlets with social media presence, all everyone knew at 2:13 a.m. was that an attack is ongoing. Nobody knew how many attackers there were and where they are. Yes, there have been social media posts insinuating that its a terrorist attack, but no major news outlet has confirmed that claim.
Everyone in the world wanted to know whats going on. Then at 2:15, Rappler publishes a ISIS claims responsibility for Resorts World Manila Casino Attack. Being the first mainstream news article that shed more light onto the issue, the article quickly went viral. As of today, it has been shared over 24,000 times on Facebook alone.

Smoke is already spreading inside the building by 2:30 a.m., or almost an hour after the fire alert, as Rappler legitimized rumors of a terrorist attack.

Thus, a person stranded inside will be made to choose between
Finding a way to exit the building but risk being shot at by terrorists, or
Staying wherever they are but risk death from asphyxiation
How likely is it that some of the 35 chose the latter? That, we may never know.

Whats clear, however, is that Rappler would have served the public better, especially those locked inside the building, some of whom died, if it just chose to shut up.

But we all know Rappler, a.k.a. Gods Gift to Journalism, didnt do so.

Ressa on the Defensive
After receiving so much flak for Rapplers mind boggling overeagerness, Rappler overlord Maria Ressa went on PR damage control mode with the article Terrorism and ISIS at Resorts World attack?, published on 03 June 2017 at 12:44 a.m, or a day after the RWM incident.

The extremely lengthy article, basically an appeal to authority, shows Ressa explaining her marvelous and gasp-inducing expertise in reporting about terrorism. The problem, however, is that Ressas highly speculative piece banks solely on the gunmans decision to commit suicide instead of running away with the chips.

The police has denied any terrorist angle in the RWM tragedy [CNN].

Not content with being humiliated once yesterday, Ressa felt another damage-control article was in order.

At 2:35 p.m. of the same day, Ressa published Casino targeted with suicide attack because its haram  ISIS, where she reported that a certain Semion Almujaheed, who claims to belong to ISIS, said in a pro-ISIS chat group that the police is doing a cover-up.

Rappler quoted Almujaheed as saying, The police is covering up Its not the soldiers of khilafah (caliphate) because they dont want to be foolish in the media briefing earlier this morning (Friday, June 2).

Wow! Khilafah! Such a big word! Sounds legit! #sarcasm

That Semion Almujaheed Guy
The problem, however, is that Ressa herself does not know who this guy is, as she decribed Semion Almujaheed as the account that provides daily updates on pro-ISIS channels of the ongoing battles in Marawi.

Yes, Maria is not even sure about who or what Semion is!
Is he Semion Almujaheed?
I searched for webpages about Semion Almujaheed [Star, Google] and I discovered that he was non-existent prior to the 23 May 2017 Marawi Clash. That is, not a single news article mentioned that name, until it magically popped up in that purportedly pro-ISIS chatroom last week.

So Maria Ressa basically believes in the word of people she just met? And assuming that Almujaheeds updates on Marawi is accurate, isnt it possible that Almujaheed is just some low-level insurgent with a passion for Whatsapp? How does his week-long existence definitively establish his knowledge of whats going on in Metro Manila, which is almost 1500 kilometers away from Marawi City?

Rapplers quality control standards for its sources appear to be as low as its quality standards for its employees.

Let me cut this long story short: Maria Ressa barely knows who Almujaheed is, yet she trusts his word more than common sense, let alone official sources.

Brilliant! But this gets more comedic.

Maria Ressas Perhaps
In the same article, Ressa said Almujaheed gave the attacker his first public identity: Abu Khair al Luzonee or Khair from Luzon, perhaps a signal that the Mindanao-based group has now attracted members in Luzon.

Again, Maria is engaging in speculation. Where does she get her articles? From a crystal ball?

Obviously, that is not the attackers real name, as it has been established that the attacker is Jessie Carlos, a former government employee with serious money problems and a more serious gambling addiction [CNN]. The attackers parents even successfully identified the body and said it was that of their son [CNN].
Jessie Carlos doesnt look ""khair"" to me.
But lets entertain Ressas fantasies for few moments.

Again, the name is Abu Khair al Luzonee which Ressa translated to Khair from Luzon. But Khair is a Quranic name that means noble, admirable and praiseworthy. So how can someone with serious money problems brought about by his addiction to gambling  which is haram (forbidden) in Islam  be in any way noble, admirable and praiseworthy?

It seems Ressa was stupid enough to get hoodwinked. But wait, theres more!

At 12:01 p.m., Rappler itself reported the name of the suspect (Jessie Carlos), this article was published a full two-and-a-half hours BEFORE Ressa reported that Khair from Luzon!

Didnt anyone from Rapplers editorial tell Ressa that they already know its Jessie, or was Ressa already foaming so much in the mouth that nobody dared go near her?

Ah, Maria Ressa. You may have had an Ivy League education, but it doesnt show.

My friends, Rappler has officially cemented its reputation as a fake news site, and Maria Ressa and her Rapperettes as fake journalists.

P.S. I didn't proofread this article anymore: neither Rappler nor Ressa deserve that.",RJ Nieto,"June 4, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/06/after-resorts-world-tragedy-rappler.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Ill-gotten wealth? Analyzing Rapplers Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra Property,"Duterte's Alleged San Juan Property (Courtesy: Rappler)

[UPDATED 19 May 2017] Rappler's 19 May 2017 article ""How Duterte's wealth in 1st 6 months compares with Aquino's"" is basically a one-thousand-word essay accusing President Rodrigo Duterte of amassing ill-gotten wealth while Rappler conveniently ignores publicly available facts.

In that article, Ressa's minion Michael Bueza, the same guy who murdered PNP's crime stats, said compared changes in Duterte's SALN to that of Aquino.


Aside from the really, really bad math, I cannot for the life of me understand why such an analysis is even relevant when Duterte himself said recently that the P3-million jump in his net worth is from amount ABS-CBN owes him after the latter did not air his campaign ads [GMA].

But what's most striking in the entire tinapa-wrapper of an article is the mention of a certain alleged Duterte-owned San Juan property, which Rappler has extensively, though amateurishly, discussed in the May 2016 article ""Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra Property""

Let me quote that part of May 19 article:
Curiously, not declared in all of his SALNs was a property in 386 P. Guevara Street in San Juan City. Duterte reportedly bought the said townhouse for his son Sebastian in 2001, when the President was then Davao City congressman.
You see, I have already definitively debunked this theory last year, and let me show you what I wrote back then .

Geez, Rapplerettes never learn.
That San Juan Townhouse
Journalists are expected to provide evidence to back their claims and to take every step possible to minimize the risk of misunderstanding information. This is the same reason why news articles are separated from opinion-editorial pieces. News articles from trustworthy sources should contain solid evidence from both sides and should contain little to no speculation.

Let's analyze this particular Rappler article and see if it passes those standards.

According to the 04 May 2016 Rappler article entitled Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra property:
Duterte and co-accountholder Sara, his daughter, used 386 P. Guevarra St as the home address for the BPI Julia Vargas account. P Guevarra is a street in the Municipality of San Juan in Metro Manila, so lets call this property the San Juan House
Dutertes San Juan House property was not included in his current and past SALNs.
A source had confirmed that Duterte had indeed it sometime between 1998 to 2001 for P 1.5 million.
Property was registered under Sebastians name. He turned 18 in 2006.
2012 SALN Guidelines require SALN declarations shall include the properties, liabilities, business interests, and financial connections ""of the declarant, his/her spouse and unmarried children below 18 years of age living in his/her household.""
Though Sebastian was probably still being supported by his father from 2001 to 2005, he was living away and was not part of his fathers household then. Rappler speculates this allowed Duterte to exclude the property in his SALNs.
Is he off the hook, his critics are asking.

SALN Guidelines
Now, lets analyze.

ThinkingPinoy questions Rapplers use of 2012 SALN Guidelines to dictate what should be done on SALNs from 2004 to 2006. This is because the 1987 Constitution itself prohibits the creation of ex post facto laws [Article III, Sec. 22].

This is a little disturbing because new SALN forms were issued in 2011 [PCIJ], and the next revision was in 2013, in response to the loopholes found during the late CJ Coronas impeachment trial [Rappler].


In short, Rappler based the 2006 requirements on guidelines that may have applied only to the years 2011 and 2012. To make matter worse, SALN guidelines were also changed in 2008 [GMA].

Two strikes for Rappler.

Thats some shoddy research on Rapplers part.

Age of Majority
Rappler said the 386 P Guevarra property should have been in Dutertes pre-2007 SALNs, as Sebastian turned 18 only in 2006. But is that claim correct?

ThinkingPinoy researched Sebastians current age. It turned out to be 28 years as of 30 April 2016 [Inquirer]. This implies that his actual birthdate is between 01 May 1987 and 30 April 1988. But we do not need to know his actual birthdate: we only need to know if he was born on or before 31 December (Ill tell you why later).

Lets take a look at this Instagram photo posted on 02 November 2015 by his sister Sara Duterte:


As we can see, the first comment shows his sister Sara greeting him a happy birthday, implying that his birthday was around November 2. Recalling that his birthday falls between 01 May 1987 and 30 April 1988, we can infer that he was born in 1987.

Thus, he turned 18 sometime between mid-October 2005 and mid-November 2005. After all, it would have been absurd for his sister, who lives in the same city, to greet him too early or too late.


That is, Sebastian turned 18 before 31 December 2005. Now, SALN requires information on the time of filing, so Dutertes 2006 SALN can exclude the P Guevarra home.

Rappler has no copies of SALNs filed prior to 2004, so Rappler should have evaluated SALNs from 2004 and 2005 only, and not 2006.

After all, three counts of SALN under-declaration is worse than two.

Strike three for Rappler.

Now, looking at the 2004 and 2005 SALNs, it is clear that the San Juan House was not included, and this leads us to the next question

Custody of Minor
Rappler itself reported that Dutertes ex-wife Elizabeth Zimmerman filed for annulment in 1998, with the petition granted two years later in 2000 [Rappler].

Duterte never showed up in annulment hearings, though he was required to undergo a psych test, where he was found to be an antisocial narcissist [Rappler].

As a side note and before you get any crazy ideas, lets make it clear that these findings are unreliable if used to gauge his actual personality. Why? Because if I want to divorce my wife, I will show the psychologist behaviour that will elicit the most apocalyptic diagnosis. The worse the diagnosis, the better, just want to get the whole thing over with.

For the annulment court, antisocial narcissism was enough.

At this point, we know Duterte was annulled in 2000, and with that court decision comes the determination of who gets child custody. Now, Sebastian was no more than 13 at that time. Adding the fact that the courts believe his dad is an antisocial narcissist, what are the odds that Duterte will be granted custody of a minor?

Evidence suggests that Elizabeth was given custody of Sebastian in 2000, or 2001 at the latest.

Of course, ThinkingPinoy concedes that custody could still have been given to Duterte, but Rappler should have  mentioned that, as they claim to have the court documents in the first place [Rappler].

That's strike four.
And just to make sure all bases are covered, some would argue that Sebastian attended high school in Davao while Zimmerman stayed in Manila in the middle of the annulment proceedings. However, the fact that Zimmerman still got to run in 2001 Davao Local Elections is proof that she still resided in Davao City post-annulment.
In the article in question, Rappler admitted that Sebastian was living away and was not part of his fathers household then.

However, a trusting reader will most likely interpret this as living in the San Juan House as opposed to living in Davao, implying that Duterte skirted SALN guidelines to make him look cooler.

But with the presence of a better explanation (Zimmerman has custody), that wording proves to be woefully inadequate.

In short, Rapplers twist on geography as basis SALN exclusion is suboptimal, to say the least.

Rappler strikes five times.

Ownership of Property and Bank Addresses

A source close to the Duterte family informed me that Sebastian acquired the property in June 2001 using his mother Elizabeth Zimmermans funds.

Now, the Duterte-Zimmerman annulment was in 2000, with Sebastian under Zimmermans custody. Adding Rappler's admission that Sebastian was ""living away"" from Duterte, the old man cannot consider Sebastian to be part of his household. 

Moreover, the San Juan property was bought using Zimmermans funds post-annulment, so it cannot be argued that it was Dutertes riches that made it possible.

Assuming Duterte will be indicted for violating RA 6713 governing SALNs [DOLE], that would be more of a technicality than something caused by presence of an intention to amass ill-gotten wealth.

Thats just stupid. 

Rappler, thats strike six.

San Juan as Address on Bank Account
Now, Rappler based their speculations on Dutertes SALNs from 2004 to 2006. Despite ThinkingPinoys demonstration in previous section that the 2006 SALN is inapplicable, lets just move forward with Rapplers assumptions. Sige, partidahan na.

Based on his estimated birthday in the previous section, Sebastian was still 14 in 2001, so he should still be in high school at least up to 2002. Sebastian attended the Ateneo de Davao High School [Inquirer], so Zimmerman, who has custody over him, should also be residing in Davao City. Thus, neither Sebastian nor Zimmerman resided in the San Juan House.

Pinahiram kaya kay Duterte yung bahay?



Duterte was congressman from June 1998 to June 2001:those were the years when he presumably resided in Metro Manila. Adding the fact that the property was purchased on 13 June 2001 or about 2 weeks before his congressional term ends. Thats also more than a month and a half after the 2001 Davao Local Elections where Duterte (again) won the mayoralty.

What are the odds that Duterte lived there at all?

Nil. Zilch. Zero.

Lets recap:
Sebastian owns the San Juan house bought by Zimmerman. Sebastian was still a minor.
Zimmerman had custody over Sebastian.
Duterte never lived in that San Juan house.
The ink on Zimmerman and Dutertes 2000 annulment papers havent dried yet.
The best explanation would be that he used that address out of convenience, as Sara Zimmerman Duterte, the co-holder, would likely be given access to the property.

Rappler, thats strike seven.

Why did TP bother to go through all this?
ThinkingPinoy does not expect every journalist to be as meticulous as he is. However, a basic tenet of journalistic ethics is incorporating both sides of the story in every piece of work (except for opinion pieces). Thats what Rappler didnt do.

In the article Rodrigo Duterte's 386 P. Guevarra Property, Rappler published an article based solely on a leaked (and potentially illegally obtained) document and it didnt bother to contact Duterte to ask for his side.

Whether Rapplers alibi is lack of resources (which TP doubts, as TP lacks even more resources), or lack of IQ, the fact remains that their possible overzealousness to be at pace with their peers has made them forget crucial ethical considerations.

If Rappler just bothered to spare ten minutes to call the Duterte camp, it would not have made so many egregious errors in this article.

And Rappler, thats strike eight. 

And you still wonder why Dutertards and Dutertrolls are so fiercely defensive? (TP)

Gina Lopez awarded P9-B to USec Camara?,"Earlier today, Manila Standard (MS) published Lopez scored for charcoal making plan. Let's fact-check it.

Here's a rundown of the articles contents.
Airboard Co. owner Manuel Galvez, a critic of Environment Secretary Gina Lopez, accused the latter of awarding a P9 billion charcoal making contract to BioChar, a company owned by Environment Usec. Philip Camara.
Lopez issued DENR Administrative Order 2017-05, which orders all DENR offices to implement the BioChar project.
Camara drafted the DENR A.O., where he was designated as head of the Biochar program.
The Biochar mentioned in the DENR A.O. is not even a technology.
That the contract is a clear case of Graft and Corruption.
Camara has resigned on April 7 per the Civil Service Commissions ruling that he was unqualified to become a Usec.
Lopez said Biochar is has 52 known green uses, but Galvez challenged Lopez claims, arguing that he has yet to see a study showing Biochar helps mitigate climate change.
To sum it up, the major issues against Lopez are:
That the biochar referred to in DENR AO 2017-05 is not even a technology.
That there are no studies that suggests biochar mitigates climate change.
That biochar, in reality, is a company owned by former DENR Usec. Camara.
That Lopez committed graft and corruption by awarding a multi-billion peso contract to Camaras Biochar.
Lets fact-check Galvezs claims.

1: Biochar is not even a technology
According to [DENR AO 2017-05], entitled Guidelines for the Implementation of the Biochar Program:
Biochar  a form of charcoal that is produced by exposing organic waste matter to heat in a low-oxygen environment. It can be used for a range of [sustainable] applications
The DENR AO used Biochar.org as its reference for that definition. I admit that the site has a questionable reputation, as it appears to be a news aggregator about everything related to biochar, not some website by a well-known organization.

Thus, we ask, Is biochar a real technology?
According to Washington State Universitys Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources [WSU-CSANR] on its article entitled Biochar (Pyrolisis):
Pyrolysis is the thermo-chemical conversion of dry organic materials (i.e. woody wastes) into bio-oil, syngas, and biochar. Biochar is being promoted for its potential to improve soil properties, fertility and carbon sequestration in soil while also producing renewable energy.
Yes, biochar is a legitimate technology, as DENRs definition sufficiently matches WSUs, and there are many other university websites who use a definition similar to DENRs [Google].

2: Biochar positive and climate change
Galvez claimed that he has yet to see studies suggesting that biochar mitigates climate change, so I scoured the internet for such, and I have found several studies that corroborates DENRs position.

In his journal article Bio-energy in the Black, Lehmann wrote [Lehmann 2007]:
Three environmental benefits (of biochar are):  mitigation of climate change,  improvement of soils, and  reduction of environmental pollution.
Professor Johannes Lehmann is a multi-awarded Professor in Cornell Universitys School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences Section [Cornell].
Aside from Lehmann, the many reputable studies also suggest biochars positive role in climate change, such as:
Sohi et Al. . Biochar, climate change and soil: A review to guide future research. CSIRO Land and Water Science Report. Retrieved from [Google Scholar].
Swanson, J. . Climate-Change Mitigation Potential of Biochar: A Review and Framework for Carbon Accounting. Duke University - Nicholas School of the Environment. Retrieved from [Duke University e-Library ].
Winsley, P. . Biochar and bioenergy production for climate change mitigation. New Zealand Science Review. Vol 64. Retrieved from [Penn State U Citeseerx].
A simple [Google] search provides more scholarly articles showing biochars ability to help mitigate climate change. In short, biochars potential for mitigating climate change is well-established.

Yes, biochar helps mitigate climate change.

3: USec. Camara owns a company named Biochar.
DENR USec. Camara is the founder and CEO of the Philippine Biochar Association (PBiA). He is also the co-Founder and Chief Agriculturist of the Sambali Beach Farm, a demonstration farm for a sustainable biochar-based technology [ResponsibleBusiness].

The PBiA, in itself, is not a for-profit organization, as it merely serves as a facilitator of biochar companies all over the country [PBIA]. Meanwhile, Camaras Sambali Beach Farm is more of a small-to-medium scale organic farm with a resort on the side [SBF FB], and judging from the photos of the place, it is unlikely that this company can perform a biochar program on a massive scale [SBF IG].
I have searched online for any newly-formed, large scale, local biochar company, under Camara, and there arent any [Google].

Basically, Galvez appears to be referring to PBiA, an association of biochar companies that, in itself, does not directly participate in biochar production. Instead, PBiAs member-companies who do.


4: Lopez awarded Camara a P9-billion biochar contract
DENR USec for Field Operations Philip Camara indeed spearheaded the issuance of the February 2017 DENR AO, as shown by his signature at the end of the said document. However, Section 10 states that the order becomes effective only after it has been published in a newspaper, which happened only on 04 April 2017 [DENR]. 
Meanwhile, the Civil Service Commission, citing ineligibility, ordered Camaras dismissal from service on 05 April 2017 [BW], which Camara considered effective and final on 07 April 2017 [DENR].

Thus, if a P9-billion biochar contract was indeed issued, two things are clear:  that it was issued after 04 April 2017, and  Camara is probably out of it, as he was fired immediately after the AO was considered effective.

Of course, that isnt enough, so we ask the following question:
Did Lopez really issue a P9-billion biochar contract and if so, to whom?

DENR on Biochar
I contacted DENR Usec Marlo Mendoza earlier today to ask for answers. Mendoza is DENR's officer-in-charge for Field Operations, i.e. Camaras replacement.

Mendoza categorically denied the existence of any P9-billion biochar contract.

He said:
There is no concession with Philip Camara. Camara has been (advocating) the use of biochar for how many years already. Biochar is a technology: it is not a brand.
Mendoza explained that DENRs biochar project is under the National Greening Program, so awarding a P9-billion contract is impossible. He said:
Our budget for the National Greening Program is just P6.9 billion, and thats for the entire program.
Mendoza further stated that funding for DENRs biochar program is small. He said:
We allocated only P150,000 per peoples organization for use in buying equipment and supplies, capacity building, and training, and theres an expected specific output.
Asked on how many peoples organizations have been award DENR contracts, Mendoza said:
Right now, a generous estimate would be 10 to 20 peoples organizations.
Assuming 20 have been awarded contracts, that would amount to only P3 million pesos, a far cry from the alleged P9 billion contract.

Mendoza clarified that all of these people's organizations are small groups. None of them has the capacity for large-scale biochar production, which would have been necessary to perform a P9 billion biochar production contract.

In short, the alleged contract in the MS article does not exist.

The claims in the MS article are hogwash, and I respectfully encourage Ms. Herrera to perform due diligence before publishing articles. A simple call to DENR would have clarified the issue, a call that she regrettably failed to place",RJ Nieto,"May 2, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/05/gina-lopez-awarded-p9-b-to-usec-camara.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake

He said:
There is no concession with Philip Camara. Camara has been (advocating) the use of biochar for how many years already. Biochar is a technology: it is not a brand.
Mendoza explained that DENRs biochar project is under the National Greening Program, so awarding a P9-billion contract is impossible. He said:
Our budget for the National Greening Program is just P6.9 billion, and thats for the entire program.
Mendoza further stated that funding for DENRs biochar program is small. He said:
We allocated only P150,000 per peoples organization for use in buying equipment and supplies, capacity building, and training, and theres an expected specific output.
Asked on how many peoples organizations have been award DENR contracts, Mendoza said:
Right now, a generous estimate would be 10 to 20 peoples organizations.
Assuming 20 have been awarded contracts, that would amount to only P3 million pesos, a far cry from the alleged P9 billion contract.

Mendoza clarified that all of these people's organizations are small groups. None of them has the capacity for large-scale biochar production, which would have been necessary to perform a P9 billion biochar production contract.

In short, the alleged contract in the MS article does not exist.

The claims in the MS article are hogwash, and I respectfully encourage Ms. Herrera to perform due diligence before publishing articles. A simple call to DENR would have clarified the issue, a call that she regrettably failed to place",RJ Nieto,"April 30, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/04/gina-lopez-gave-p9-b-to-usec-camara.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"On 'Manufactured Noise', anti-Duterte media bias makes financial sense","A former PR operator who now likes to be called a veteran journalist, Miss Manufactured Noise (not her real name) went to a university and asked her barely adult audience whether theyve heard about certain popular Facebook pages or not. After hearing less than half of them raised their hands, she then went on to conclude that all the buzz generated by these Facebook pages were just, as she calls it, manufactured noise.

As an owner of a Facebook Page with considerable following, I saw her observation as less of a critique of people like me and more of a psychological projection, if not a desperate cry for attention. Because Miss MN, who accuses us of ""manufactured noise"", admitted to having a long history of manufacturing noise herself.


Bubby Dacer
Several weeks ago, I published a post with a line that reads:
Miss Veteran Journalist, natatandaan mo pa ba si 'Bubby Dacer'?
In response, Miss Mainstream Journalist wrote an incommensurately lengthy post to explain to the public how she turned down several major deals while she was still working for Dacer, saying that there are lines she wouldnt cross.
Miss Mainstream Journalist was the former right hand person of slain Public Relations (PR) consultant Bubby Dacer, who was known as one of the most influential spin doctors in the 1990s. He allegedly handled Public Relations (PR) work for powerful politicians and ultra-rich businessmen until he suddenly disappeared and was later found dead in 2001.

I was still a teenager when Dacer died, and I never really understood why there was so much coverage about him afterwards. Back then, I didnt understand why theres so much interest on this fellow. Truth be told, the resolution of his case has been, for the longest time, the concern of a tiny subset of the sociopolitical elite.

That is, until today.

Disclaimer
From this point, I am forced to hide the identity of all my first-hand sources. The local PR establishment is relatively small and people know each other. Given the amount of money that changes hands regularly, mentioning their names can almost surely get them in major trouble, if not killed.

Moreover, note that this is not some demolition job against Miss Manufactured Noise. If her websites negligible monthly traffic is an indicator, shes already past her journalistic heydays. Theres no need to demolish her career: its more convenient for me to just let it die a natural death.

However, I felt that her story is relevant to help explain whats going on in the government today. In short, I will use her story as my Exhibit A.

If youre a TP reader who only reads TP articles that are replete with citations, then this is not the article for you. I promise that the next one will be. But for this one, I cant.

If youre good with that, lets go.

The Seedy PR World
Miss MNs de facto reply to my March 21 post consisted of a list of projects that she supposedly turned down, essentially claiming that she still has some sort of moral fiber in her. Her defensiveness, however, is indicative of one basic fact: that PR work is dirty, that PR work isnt something that one cant openly brag about.
Last week, a veteran journalist told me that he found it surprising that mainstream accepted Miss Mainstream Journalist despite her PR past, as hardcore journos typically maintain a condescending attitude towards PR-people-turned-journalists. However, the same person said this is probably because she allegedly had many mainstream journalists on her payroll in the past, so that kind of attitude didnt apply to her.

But what, exactly is PR?

In 2011, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) crowdsourced a definition for PR [PRSA]:
Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics.
With this definition, PR is basically about deodorizing a companys image, and thats what most PR and advertising companies do. The same applies to the Philippine context, as most PR and advertising companies here stick to preparing press releases and making sure theyre broadcast or published through Mass Media. That is, most PR firms activities are above-board.

But Bubby Dacer wasnt just another PR guy.

A high-profile lawyer told me that Bubby Dacer walked the extra mile: he was one of the first professional publicists to do black ops  for a fee. For the right price, hes willing to destroy the reputation of anyone or anybody and this is presumably why Miss Mainstream Journalist got so riled up over the mention of his name and of her name in the same sentence.

Yes, Miss Mainstream Journalist said in her post that she turned down three projects, including that of a former first lady. Lets concede to that, but how other projects did she not turn down?

I think this can best be explained by a letter from one of my readers.

MNs HQ: The Manila Hotel
Let me publish here a letter from a reader who happen to have stumbled upon my March 21 post. I have redacted some parts of the letter to protect the readers identity.
(I have just) read your Facebook post about **********, a.k.a. Ms. Manufactured Noise.
I can personally confirm and validate the claims of your source about her and Bubby Dacer. She is the wingman of Bubby Dacer during his PR firm's heydays back in the mid-90s. Imagine, they had their offices in Manila Hotel then. I think you were just in your short pants then.
I used to deal a lot with her as the point person of Dacer every time we have a press release to publish as I was the Corporate Communications Officer then of **********, the ********** in **********. 
She was Bubby's operator to the media. She pays off the media contacts to publish our press releases and she then shows proof of publication to us afterwards. Their firm also handles the black ops PR for our company back then and Bubby Dacer is getting a monthly retainer of P** million for that. That is on top of expenses after every press release is published. That's a lot of money back in 19** to 19** you know.
If Miss Mainstream Journalist was so transparent about her work under Dacer, then why wont she name her clients that paid her and her boss to do black ops?
Journalists paid by PR firms to write twisted stories are real. Miss MN, actually, knows quite a few, because she paid them herself, and handsomely at that, right?

At this point, I think the reader has pretty good idea of how black ops PR works. Thus, its time to explain how its relevant to the status quo.
Corruption in Journalism
Asked in June 2016 about media deaths, Duterte said [CNN]:
You know why they are killed? Most of them are on the take
Mainstream media reported that line as if its something so foreign to them, despite that fact that many of them are, or have been, on the take.

Ten months later, not even a single news outfit has released even a single expose about even a single corrupt journalist. Actually, media companies generally do not pursue stories against other media companies and when they do, they frame the stories in the form of someone-said-this-about-that, instead of hard hitting investigative reports with documentary evidence and the whole nine yards.

The reason, I believe, is simple: Mutually-Assured Destruction.
Miss MN, for example, is known to be fiercely protective whenever mainstream media is criticized on social media, even in times when the mainstream media outfit  or the mainstream media man  is clearly in the wrong.
Well, what are the risks of doing otherwise? Imagine Miss Mainstream Journalist agreeing to a criticism against Journalist X or media outfit Y. Given Bubby Dacers scale of operations, theres bound to be someone sympathetic to X or Y who would croak about Miss MNs previous black ops work.

On the flip side, I have written in a previous section that mainstream wholeheartedly accepted ex-PR person Miss Mainstream Journalist because many of them owe Mainstream Journalist a debt of gratitude. And besides, Miss Mainstream Journalist likely has enough ammunition to destroy most journalists who get in her way.
Yeah, if one croaks, then the other croaks too. Hence, zero exposs.

But were not done yet.

The Duterte EJK Saga
Everybody knows that the single biggest criticism against the Duterte Administration is the alleged thousands of extra-judicial killings (EJKs) committed by his administration.

At first, the EJK Bible was the Inquirers Kill List: it was the most oft-cited article when someone talks about EJKs. The problem, however, is that by September, the lists growth has someone slowed down, and what little transparency in methodology it had led keen observers to notice its damning flaws [TP: Illogicalities]. For one, some of the people it listed turned out to be alive.

Despite its monumental flaws, it was the go-to reference for any critic of the Duterte administration. That is, until college sorority blog Rappler came along.

Overeager to steal the limelight, Rappler came up with its own tally. No, it was not even a list: it was just a tally that Rappler employee Michael Bueza claims as official data from the PNP, something that PNP spokesperson Dionardo Carlos vehemently denied [TP: Bad Math]. For one, over half of the total in Buezas list comprise of deaths under investigation, which means that their link to the the narco-trade have yet to be established. 


These two lists have served  or have been serving  as the justification for many an article against the Duterte Administration, despite the fact that these two lists, especially Buezas, are essentially fake news.

Despite this, we have been witness to several coordinated media blitzes in the past several months, with journalist Krizette Chu observing two: one on 09 December 2016, and another on 30 December 2016.

The timing of these two blitzes is nothing short of interesting, as it suggests (costly) attempts at PR damage control.

The first blitz was right after VP Leni Robredo resigned from the cabinet [CNN], while the other was in the heat of the #NasaanSiLeni controversy, or when Robredo flew to the US for a family vacation despite the knowledge that a supertyphoon is about to hit her hometown [TP: Thief in the Night].

And dont even get me started at mainstream medias general unwillingness to publish stories that are  unfavorable to the Liberal Party [TP: LeniLeaks] or  favorable to the Duterte Administration.

Internet empowered PR firms
Corruption in journalism is as old as the journalism profession itself, the practice of PR companies paying journalists to write heavily spun  if not outrightly false  stories is already a given.

Whats more interesting, however, is the magnitude at which they do it right now.

The advent of affordable high-speed internet and the rise of social media has exposed mainstream news outfits to unprecedented levels of competition. With the digital shift, many publications have shut down while those that remain suffer dwindling readerships.

Worse, websites do not generate as much revenue, and publishers are struggling to reconcile meager income with bloated operating expenses.
The best example would be Rappler.com, or the college sorority blog thats pretending to be a news outfit. Since its 2011 launch, Rappler has posted total comprehensive losses of Php 162 million, and it has yet to turn a profit in any single fiscal year [TP: Bankrupt].

Despite this, Rappler keeps on going, and going, and going, with massive yearly capital infusions keeping it afloat, capital infusions that do not make financial sense until
Have you seen a single Rappler blog post that openly criticized Leni Robredo? Exactly.
This is aside from the fact that journalism as a profession doesnt pay well: I know of several veteran journalists who are worried about how they will send their kids to college. That's how little journalists get paid.

For every financially struggling journalist, the temptation to accept money from PR firms is real.

Thankfully, many journalists refused to join the dark side, but more of them do.

A Global Trend
I think this is the best time to quote Aphorism 46 of Nietzsches Beyond Good and Evil [Quora]:

He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

The publics growing distrust of mainstream media is not endemic to the Philippines. It is a global trend, and it is this same kind of distrust that propelled Donald Trump to the US presidency [DenverPost].

When I was in San Francisco in February, I had the honor of having a lengthy conversation with a senior member of the Philippine diplomatic corps. We talked about this seemingly one-sided view of the Duterte Administration in the international scene, and this is what the diplomat told me:
Western traditional media is financially dying. Media companies have become even more reliant than ever on funding from PR firms for them to stay solvent. These Western news organizations do not really care about the Philippines: its culture is so foreign and for many, its just as far as way as Mars. But why do American papers fixate on everything Duterte does? Its simple: because writing about him pays the bills. Now, as to who pays the PR bills, I have a few in mind.
Well, after the two anti-Duterte December media blitzes that all-too-coincidentally happened right after Robredo-centered controversies, I think I have a pretty good idea where part of the funding comes from. Note that I used the word part of the funding because aside from political parties, the funding may also come from foreign government.

Take for example the case of Ukrainian TV. 

Rappler and Omidyar
Last year, Kenneth Rapoza of [Forbes] wrote:
The best way to raise funds for a media project in Ukraine? Go full-bore anti-Russia to easily woo North American and European governments to give you money.
The article said the funders of Ukrainian Hromadske.TV include the GOVERNMENTS of Canada, the Netherlands, United States, Switzerland, Swede, Germany, and the European Union.

Interestingly, the same Forbes article mentioned the Omidyar Network in the same paragraph where it mentioned funding agencies of the seven governments listed above. Yes, the same Omidyar Network that has reportedly, in cooperation with the US government, helped fund the Ukrainian Revolution, i.e. the overthrow of the Ukrainian Government [Pando].

And why is it interesting for Filipinos? Because Omidyar is one of Rapplers funders [Omidyar].

You see, intervention by foreign powers are the exact reason why the constitution prohibits foreign ownership of local media except that some media companies, like Salim-owned TV5 and Philippine Star, know how to circumvent this constitutional provision.

And Rappler is just as guilty as the MVP-owned companies, after it accepted money from the same Omidyar Network mentioned above.

Countering PR Spin
How can we counter international PR spin when hiring PR companies is very expensive?
President Gloria was accused in 2007 of hiring Covington & Burling LLP, a hyper-influential US PR firm, for a US$ 50-million, six-month contract for pro-administration PR in the US, although then-Senator Mar Roxas said the contract may be for something more, perhaps like getting the US Defense and Military establishment to soften resistance to a new strain of Martial Law [Roxas] .
PR companies, however, may cost a lot less than that. But for a poor country like the Philippines, even one percent of that amount is a lot of money. Hence, we unfortunately are incapable of fighting fire (bad PR) with fire (Good PR), for the simple reason that the president is unwilling to spend that much on it.

And no, open letters to mainstream media will not work. Quoting Upton Sinclair:
It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it!
At this point, I think the best course of action, given financial constraints, is the reintroduction of the Press Attach in key diplomatic missions. I extensively discussed this in last weeks article Duterte vs the World: it's time to review our international PR strategy.

But let me be clear on this, press attachs cannot realistically reverse the tide of international opinion. However, it can, at least, ensure that international media agencies, while writing anti-Administration stories, will have no good reason not to get the Duterte governments side of story.

And on a final note, your feeling that theres some sort of media conspiracy against Duterte is not totally unfounded. Miss Mainstream Journalist is evidence that corruption in journalism existed during her time, and there are more Miss MNs who are active in the country and elsewhere today.

I am personally unable to see any definitive solution to the problems that people like Miss Mainstream Journalist cause, but I hope that through this article, youve gained a better understanding of the challenges we are facing today

You see, the first step towards a solution is understanding the problem, and here it is.",RJ Nieto,"April 16, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/04/on-manufactured-noise-anti-duterte.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Another Lavia and another Kidapawan Massacre if Usec Valdez stayed?,"And this story has something to do with the termination of Peter Tiu Lavia. AWESOME!

President Rodrigo Dutertes termination of Undersecretary Maia Halmen Valdez sent shockwaves throughout the country [Inq]. One of the most trusted aides of Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco, the Boholanon was the third to go onto the chopping block, after Irrigation Chief Peter Tiu Lavia [Star] and Interior Secretary Mike Sueo [Star].

Citing his uncompromising stance against corruption, Duterte fired Valdez after the latter usurped the powers of her superior after she extended the National Food Authoritys rice importation deadline, a task thats supposed to have been solely in the power of the NFA Administrator subject to the approval of the President [Inq].

Duterte, from the very start, prohibited rice importation during harvest season, as the massive influx of cheap imported rice at this time causes prices to fall drastically, hurting the livelihood of Filipino farmers.
Usec. Maia Halmen Valdez
Was Valdez just a tad too overzealous, or is there a reason behind what she did?

After asking around, it appears that the sacked undersecretarys father has much to gain from Valdezs moves.

The Power Structure
But before that, its essential for the reader to gain a basic understanding of the underlying power structure, i.e. who-does-who.

At the top of the food chain is President Duterte, and right below him is Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco. For unknown reasons and via Executive Order No. 1 [Gov], Duterte delegated the oversight of some twelve agencies to Evasco.
Sec. Evasco chairs these twelve agencies ex officio, or by virtue of his appointment. Of course, Evasco is just one man, so its virtually impossible for him to attend all the board meetings of all his agencies. As a remedy, he made Pres. Duterte appoint undersecretaries, undersecretaries who help him in overseeing the agencies operations.

The three Evasco-led agencies relevant to this article are:
National Food Authority (NFA)
Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA/Philcoa), and
National Irrigation Administration (NIA).
And heres where Undersecretary Valdez comes in.

Acting as a de facto executive assistant, Valdez is presumably close to Evasco. Palace insiders and I are not exactly privy to Valdez and Evascos shared background. However, she has to be someone whom Evasco trusts very well.

That is, Evasco chose Valdez despite [Palapos 2014]:
She was merely a political affairs officer for a Zamboanga congressman. A relatively minor post, a sudden appointment as undersecretary is a big leap. 
The Zamboanga congressman she worked for was Isagani Amatong, a member of the Liberal Party.
As an undersecretary, Valdez oversaw NFA, NIA, and PCA, acting as de facto Chairperson, being Evascos representative in these three agencies. 

Ricenomics 101
To begin, the reader has to have a working understanding of Philippine Ricenomics, which focuses mainly on controlling the countrys rice supply.

Rice shortages are common in the Philippines [Onofre 2008], and these are addressed through two mechanisms [RiceHQ].


FIRST is Government-to-Government (G2G) procurement, or the Philippine Government directly enters into a contract with a foreign government that has excess rice to export.

SECOND is the Minimum Access Volume (MAV) Program, which allows private importers to import rice with lower tariffs.
DEFINITION: TARIFF
Tariffs are taxes levied on imports, mainly as a source of government income, and also as a means to protect a local industry. Raising tariffs makes imports more expensive, allowing locally produced equivalents more competitive. Meanwhile, lowering tariffs makes imports more affordable for Filipino consumers.
MAV quotas are set yearly, with the NFA tasked with the issuance of importation permits to private rice importers and MAV is where corruption begins.

Now that that's out of the way, it's time for the writer to teach you corruption.

Minimum Access Volume Program
NFA's 2016 MAV Program sets our importation limit at about 800,000 metric tons [NFA], and NFA sources told the writer that the agency issued 193 permits to different private companies.

Now, NFA sources informed the writer that NFA officials from the past administration, in exchange for issuing rice importation permits, receive about Php 10 million in bribes per permit. With 193 permits issued last year, this translates to a total of around Php 1.93 billion in dirty money. 

Whoever received that would have been a very, very wealthy (and corrupt) man.
The bribes make business sense, as rice imported through MAV costs US$ 400 per metric ton on the average, so that 800,000 metric tons of imported rice costs US$320 million, or about Php 16 billion if converted with US$ to Php at 1:50.  

Clearly, Php 16 billion dwarfs Php 2 billion.

Even Rappler's Michael Bueza, who sucks in math, should know that [TP: Rappler's EJK Math].

Inefficient Rice Traders
Rice importers are businessmen, so they need to make the most out of the bribes theyve paid. Unfortunately, many of them are inefficient so they werent able to maximize their respective rice importation limits before the importation deadline expired on 28 February 2017 [NFA].

Cabinet Secretary Jun Evasco (L) and President Rodrigo Duterte (RO+)
Specifically, NFA sources said these permit holders managed to import only 580,000 metric tons, or just 80 percent of the MAV limit.

To address this issue, Usec Maia Valdez, without Sec. Evascos signature and without consulting President Duterte, attempted to extend the deadline to June 2017 [NFA]. Valdez essentially usurped Evascos authority and violated Dutertes directive that no rice shall be imported during harvest season, which starts in May 2017.

And that is why Duterte terminated Valdez. But why did Duterte prohibit rice imports during the local harvest season?

That is what will be explained next.

Duterte: No to Rice Imports for now
Basically, Duterte wants to prevent another Kidapawan Massacre, when the farmers got so poor and so hungry because of the drought that they protested until they got murdered by the Aquino Government.


Duterte wants to help poor farmers earn a decent living, so his decision against rice importation during harvest season means local traders will need to buy at higher prices, to the benefit of the farmers.

Dutertes policy may translate to higher costs on the part of the average consumer, but this is market socialism at work, this is income redistribution. That is, Filipinos with better-paying jobs pay more to help poor farmers who earn so little.

Truth be told, almost any job pays better than farming.
Valdezs unilateral decision to extend MAV means rice traders can still import rice during the harvest season at approximately P17 per kilogram. This means local farmers will have to compete with rice imports, forcing them to sell their produce at costs lower than what would have been if MAV was ended in February.

Its simple supply-and-demand.

Whats worse, the Department of Agriculture expect a bumper crop in May [Star]. That is, poor farmers generally expect a very plentiful harvest, which means they can use this seasons income not only to offset losses in the previous years due to El Nio, but also as insurance against future adversities.

With Valdezs decision, another Kidapawan Massacre [TP: Roxas Speechwriter] during the next El Nio is not unlikely.

Maias Defense
The article has so far focused on MAV, and has largely left out Government-to-Government (G2G) rice importation contracts, and heres where G2G comes in.

In their desperate attempt to convince the President to resort to G2G, the Agriculture Secretary, who has been meddling on the functions and affairs of the OCS, and the NFA administrator have made it appear as if there is a shortage of rice in the country, causing alarm and possible upward movement in the prices of commercial rice, Valdez said in a statement [MS].

Valdez accused Piol and Aquino of pushing for G2G, which she said will raise rice prices.

G2G imports, however, are stored by NFA and for sale only in cases when there is a shortage, real or artificial, with the latter caused by hoarders or speculators. Otherwise they are not for commerce, as they are provided to government agencies dealing with calamities [NFA].

In short, G2G rice imports are emergency stocks provided to government agencies, such as local government units, during calamities. They are not readily introduced into the local market, so they largely do not affect rice prices.

So her defense falls flat on its face. Valdez probably knows this, but why does she insist on it?

Personal gain [NFA], and that shall be elaborated in the next section.

Why did Valdez do what she did?
Valdezs illegal order to extend MAV could have been attributed to excessive dedication, something that, despite being illegal, could be considered admirable on a certain level. However, sources from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) disagree.

NBI sources said Valdez is under investigation for violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019) and the Code of Conduct for Public Officials (RA 6713). The sources said they received reports that Valdez received bribes from rice importers who have yet to fully utilize their respective allocated quotas.

In short, Valdez allegedly received bribes so corrupt rice importers can make more money, to the detriment of poor Filipino rice farmers.

But wait, theres more!

The same NBI sources informed the writer that they are investigating Valdez for allegedly colluding with her father, who shall benefit from MAVs extension after NBI received reports that he has links with rice smuggling.

Usec Maia Halmen Valdezs father Halleck Valdez [BCC] is the customs collector at the Port of Zamboanga [Ports].
With MAV, all that a rice smuggler has to do is fix rice importation documents. For example, a rice smuggler can opt to pay taxes on just half of the rice shipments and, in collusion with a customs collector, import the other half tariff-free. 
But without MAV, rice importation is downright illegal, so it makes their smuggling more difficult, as our ports cannot accept even a single grain of rice.
Assuming the elder Valdez has smuggling links, he stands to gain from MAVs extension.

But that means every corrupt customs collector in the country will benefit from MAVs extension too, so did the younger Valdez receive bribes from officials of other ports?

And the reader is probably already very familiar with how much Duterte hates rice smugglers.


NFA Administrator Jason Aquino earlier released a 27 February 2017 letter to the NBI requesting the to investigate the attempted MAV extension's links with unscrupulous rice traders engaged in smuggling [NFA]. 

Aquino did not explicitly mention Valdez in the said letter.

The Peter Tiu Lavia Angle
Valdez is just an undersecretary, yet she appears to exercise an incommensurate level of influence in the bureaucracy. The writer has reason to believe that Sec. Evasco, her principal, has no history of corruption. However, the fact remains that Evasco trusts her more than most.

But trust is a very relative word, so its important to gauge how much of Evascos trust Valdez enjoys.

Sources from the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) and the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) explained how much influence Valdez has on Evasco.

FIRST, Valdez allegedly conspired with several power players inside the bureaucracy to get NIA Administrator Peter Tiu Lavia fired by finding ways to show that the latter condones corrupt practices of NIA officials. Lavia was essentially terminated because the NIA officials under him are corrupt.

Going by that logic, Duterte should be impeached because there are corrupt public servants under him. That doesnt sound right, but it happened anyway, allegedly thanks to Valdezs machinations.

SECOND, Valdez allegedly convinced Evasco to the suspend PCA Administrator Avelino Andal.

Theres an alleged illegal collection of P1.50 per board foot of lumber in Basilan by Andals trusted employees. We also received sworn statements stating that he is the mastermind of such scheme, Valdez told the Philippine Star [Star] in March.

PCA sources rejected Valdezs claim and said Andal actually issued an order to investigate erring PCA employees. However, Valdez allegedly found ways to link Andal with the illegal acts of his subordinates.

Yes, it appears that Evasco highly trusts Valdez, who later appears to be less savory than expected.

Is this how Valdez expected to get away with the illegal MAV extension?

As to whether Evasco is complicit in Valdezs alleged acts or not, neither the writer nor his sources know, although Evascos alleged dislike for NFA Administrator Jason Aquino (not related to the Cojuangco-Aquinos) helped Maias cause.

Truth be told, Evasco even threatened to resign as NFA chairman over the MAV issue if Duterte doesn't fire Aquino [Evasco]. The problem, however, is that he remains NFA chair as long as he's still Cabinet Secretary by virtue of EO 1, so he can leave NFA only if he resigns from the cabinet.

Evasco, however, did not tender his resignation as Cabinet Secretary.

More importantly, did Valdez deceive Evasco? It's anybody's guess.

But Evasco appears so convinced that he even granted several exclusives to a college sorority blog [Rappler], even going as far as calling the Palace ""a snake pit"" [Rappler].

Oh, well.
Finale
Rice traders, especially those involved in rice smuggling, stand to benefit the most from Valdezs decision to extend the MAV program. And with MAVs extension, poor farmers, like those in Mindanao, will earn a lot less than they would if MAV was allowed to expire.

Valdezs decision, in short, lends truth to the saying:

The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.

With Valdezs decision, the poor Kidapawan farmers will be just as poor as they were last year, the same year they begged for food and were given bullets instead.

Will there be another Kidapawan Massacre if Usec Valdez stays?

Duterte vs the World: it's time to review our international PR strategy,"Social media is arguably one of the biggest factors behind President Rodrigo Dutertes surprise win in the May 2016 elections and his continuing popularity almost a year into his term. Despite the chronically slanted coverage of oligarch-owned mainstream news outfits, Duterte still enjoys sky-high ratings that exceeds even those of former President Aquino and his Cory Magic.

But Social Media is not enough.

[FEATURED: Switzerland-based OFWs stage a demonstration in support of the Duterte Government earlier this month.]


The Domestic Public Relations War
Clearly, Facebook has become the primary battleground for local political discourse, and Duterte-aligned social media influencers collectively enjoy higher engagement rates than those of the opposition combined [TP: Mosquito Press].
For example, oppositionist Liberal Party (LP) Senator Bam Aquino attributed VP Leni Robredo plunging net satisfaction scores to black propaganda. Whether Anti-Robredo news is black propaganda or an inconvenient truth depends on which side of the political spectrum one belongs. However, one thing is clear: the propaganda war against Robredo is waged largely on Facebook, and it is extremely effective.
Suffice it to say, Duterte, his communications team, and independent Duterte-aligned social media influencers, have managed to cement his grip on popularity, at least for the foreseeable future. That is, I have good reason to believe the that local Public Relations battle has already been won, and the task of maintaining Dutertes satisfaction ratings is just a matter of keeping the current supporter base within the fold.

This is the same reason why I, ThinkingPinoy, do not publish posts as often as I did a year ago. 
Just look at what the opposition did to Lascaas: instead of pushing for more local coverage, he was flown out of the country and has started to wreak PR havoc overseas. 
Sans any well-founded corruption issue against Duterte that may pop up in the future, Duterte will enjoy popular support until the end of his term, the same popular support that enables him to be as decisive as he is right now.

But the international PR situation is not as rosy.

Duterte vs the World
The international communitys opinion of the president can use some improvement, to say the least.

Let me state it more bluntly:
Thanks to overwhelmingly negative international media coverage, and his chronically acerbic language, most Westerners think hes a mass murderer, with some believing that his administration is the reincarnation of the Third Reich.
I have extensively discussed the summary execution issue in ""Duterte's War on Narcopolitics and Rappler's Bad Math,"" where I demonstrated how the oft-cited death toll statistic of 7,000 is the result of mangled definitions or worse, malice on the part of the reporter.


However, quoting part of an email from LP-aligned billionaire lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis:

""(It) doesn't have to be true. (It) just needs to look like that.

And that's exactly what happened.

In January, for example, the European Parliament has threatened to revoke our GSP+ status [Star], which will raise tariffs on our exports. But this pales in comparison to what happened just a few months before.

Late last year, US President Obama used sharp rhetoric to denounced what he perceived as Duterte-instigated human rights violations. At the rate theyre going, a Democrat win in the 2016 US National Elections might have resulted into intervention [TP: Goldberg]. Luckily for us, the Republican Trump won, allaying immediate fears of local political observers [TP: Good for PH].
Western Governments, which are mostly democratic like that of the Philippines, are composed of political animals who generally act in accordance with public opinion. The European Parliament in itself is amoral, and it derives its morality from what the general public has to say. The United States Congress generally works the same way, though I can safely say that it has less of conscience than Europe.

Europeans have an extremely negative opinion of Duterte, thanks to its media giants that have close ties with LP and Philippine mainstream media. Yes, the same Philippine mainstream media owned by the same abusive oligarchs that Duterte is desperately trying to rein in.

Take for example, the time when Senator Leila de Lima sent an aide to speak against the Philippine Government in the Human Rights International Forum in Geneva, and all we had as a defense is a passionate Filipina OFW:


I sincerely laud her passion and patriotism, but the fact remains that we have a better chance at being heard if the speaker has the imprimatur of the National Government. As a matter of fact, that Filipina's heartfelt statements fell onto deaf ears, as UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard, the same exact person that the Filipina was addressing, ignored her plea and continued disparaging the Philippine Government right after the event.

But I am digressing.

Time is of the essence
At this rate, it may only be a matter of time before we lose our GSP+ status. And worse, given Trumps catastrophic unpopularity further exacerbated by launching airstrikes on Syria, it may only be a matter of time before he gets impeached and consequently replaced by Vice-president Mike Pence, a known supporter of humanitarian intervention [GR].
Humanitarian intervention is a euphemism for the threat or use of force by a state, group of states, or international organization.
While it may be argued that an American-led invasion of an increasingly China-friendly Philippines is unlikely, a Pence presidency brings with it a great likelihood of more subtle, but just as destructive, destabilization efforts against the Duterte Government.
But before we go too far, let me make this very clear: Good Public Relations is not the end all and be all of successful diplomacy. It is, however, an integral part of it. And this dilemma is something that the internationally frowned-upon Duterte cannot sweep under the rug anymore.

Besides, I think Duterte owes much to Overseas Filipino Workers, the same OFWs who are suffering from the international PR backlash today. 


Just take a look at what his Switzerland-based Filipina had to say:


What can Duterte do?
Admit it or not, Duterte is a Western PR disaster and something has to be done so that international opinion will not translate to increasingly likely economic and military sanctions.

During their incumbency, Dutertes predecessors had a solution for this: they have been known to hire influential international PR firms, or what I personally call deodorants and sanitizers.
President Aquino hired in 2010 an unnamed public relations firm for his US State Visit [Star]. Meanwhile, President Arroyo in 2002 hired Burson-Marsteller ""to enhance the global image of the Philippines"" especially in the eyes of ""decision-makers from both government and private sectors [Star].""

The problem, however, is that Duterte seems put Public Relations at the end of his list of priorities. A cabinet secretary recently told me, The president thinks PR is important, but hed rather spend the money on infrastructure and food security, because he thinks theyre more important.

I cannot really blame Duterte for his disinclination in spending government funds on PR. The Philippines, despite having one of the biggest economies on the planet, is still very poor. The pie is large but the number of people wholl share the pie is so much larger.

The cost of hiring a PR company
A senior member of the Philippine Diplomatic Corps, who shall not be identified for lack of authority to speak on the matter, told me that they cost around US$3 million annually on the average.

Actually, Arroyo took it to the next level in 2007, as the beleaguered president allegedly hired influential US lobby firm Covington and Burling for US$ 50 million.

In fairness to Duterte, I believe that for now, his PR nightmare is not as bad as Arroyos in 2007. International Law scholar Paula Defensor-Knack herself explained that an ICC investigation is unlikely to lift off. Well, at least for now. Regardless, Duterte been espousal of austerity in public spending since his first day in Malacaang makes it extremely unlikely, even for his most trusted men, to convince him of doing what Aquino and Arroyo did. And even if he wanted to, Duterte will find it difficult to rival the drug-fueled pockets of the Liberal Party [TP: Jesse Robredo].

Even I would cringe at that kind of price tag: only LP drug lords will be okay with that!

But Duterte is the Patron Saint of Striking a Compromise and of Finding the Middle Ground.

His stance against corruption, drugs, and criminality are non-negotiables, and I am happy about that. However, his stance on other issues, especially those that he admittedly isnt very good at, can be negotiated.

Take, for example, the Php 2,000 SSS pension hike issue:
His three populist cabinet members  Agrarian Reform Sec. Mariano, Social Welfare Sec. Taguiwalo, and NAPC Chair Maza  were totally for it. Meanwhile, his three economic managers  Finance Sec. Dominguez, Budget Sec. Diokno, and NEDA Chief Pernia  were reportedly against raising pensions by P2,000, arguing that doing so would drastically shorten the SSS funds actuarial life. 
Duterte met them halfway: he approved a Php 1,000 pension hike [Inq].
Now, whats the halfway mark on the PR issue?

A Public Relations Compromise
To President Duterte and his men, I offer a compromise:
Please reinstate the Press Attach position in major embassies.
From what Ive learned through my friends in the Diplomatic Corps, Philippine embassies and consulates used to have press attachs that served as the single point of contact for media inquiries from their host state. 

With access to press attachs in their home country, foreign media organizations can get first-hand information about the issues they cover, instead of having to tap to their Philippine correspondents, who are mostly stringers whose primary employment is with Philippines Big Media.


And we know what Big Media thinks of the president [TP: Medias Ego], especially after his recents tirades against ABS-CBN and the Philippine Daily Inquirer:

Stringers are correspondents who are not on the regular staff of a news organization, especially one retained on a part-time basis to report on events in a particular place [Reuters].

Press attachs can also serve a lot of other purposes that Id rather not mention in this article in the interest of National Security. If the higher-ups want to know more, they can contact me and Id be more than willing to share my thoughts.

Overworked Ambassadors
Unfortunately, President Cory Aquino, upon assumption of her duties, decided to eliminate the press attach position in our diplomatic roster, so we have not had a single full-time press attach since 1986.

While some camps would say that ambassadors and consul generals can take over the press-related responsibilities, the fact of the matter is that almost every major embassy we have abroad suffers from serious personnel shortages. For one, I know of a few diplomatic missions where the head even has to occasionally man the embassys windows. Thats how bad the situation is.

Consuls and ambassadors are just too overworked as it is, and a dedicated press attach is necessary to fill the gap, at least in terms of handling the countrys image overseas.

Its safe to say that Duterte enjoys a certain degree of popularity in Asia while the South American and African States are already busy with domestic affairs, so we ned not reinstate press attachs in those three continents for now. Thus, we are left with the two continents to deal with: Europe and North America.

To cut on costs, my friends and I think that we can start with two key cities in the United States and two key cities in the European Union, i.e. we will open up only four press attach positions for the meantime and see if it works.

How much would each press attach cost? I bet it's just a small fraction of the US$ 3 million price tag I mentioned earlier.

With that said, having a press attach is not a PR panacea but it will, at the least, help cushion the negative publicity overseas. With press attachs, international media outfits will have no excuse for not getting the governments official side in every story. With press attachs, international media outfits will not have to source information from local stringers whose loyalties lie on their oligarchic employers.

Will the cost of having four press attachs outweigh potential losses from losing our GSP+ status? I think not, and dont even get me started on the American Front.

Duterte's War on Narcopolitics and Rappler's Bad Math,"When Duterte said Filipinos arent inherently good in math, I think he was referring to Rappler's employees.

In September 2016, Rappler published Michael Buezas IN NUMBERS: The Philippines' 'war on drugs, which supposedly serves as a tally of the deaths resulting from President Rody Dutertes War on Drugs. Bueza has updated the list 75 times since September 2016, with the latest version (the 75th update) dated 07 April 2017.

On the 75th update, Bueza, citing revised PNP data, came up with a total of 7,080 casualties by combining 2,555; 3,603; and 922, which are the deaths from police operations, DUIs, and concluded investigations, respectively.

Rapplers tally has so far been used by various international news agencies as the basis for the death toll of Dutertes War on Drugs. It has been quoted by major organizations such as the [Financial Times, [Newsweek, the [Guardian, and even the [New York Times, and it has also been used as the basis for a [Human Rights Watch] report and a [European Parliament] resolution.

And most importantly, Vice-president Leni Robredo herself used this figure in a video address shown in a UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs side event, the same video that was featured on [Time] Magazine last month.

Yes, thats how oft-cited Rapplers article is, so lets ask a simple question that few mainstream journalists chronically fail to ask:
Is 7080 deaths an accurate body count?
Rappler vs Tiglao
In his 20 March 2017 column, Ambassador Rigoberto Tiglao accused Rappler of having misled the World, as he wrote:
The Rappler report is so patently wrong, I can only attribute it not to stupidity but to malice. It included 4,525 deaths under investigation or investigation concluded as killings related to the anti-drug war  which they arent!
Buezas simple and straightforward methodology uses the following formula:
T = P + D + C
where, T = total number of people killed in War on Drugs; P = suspected drug personalities killed in police operations; D = victims in cases of deaths under investigation (DUI); and C = victims in cases where investigation has concluded
And herein lies the problem: it appears to be a classic case not only of bad Math, but also of bad terminology.

Rapplers and Buezas Collective Confusion
The Rappler article did not provide any precise definition of any of the equations variables, and thats something that me, who is darned good in High School Math, find problematic.

Moreover, I do not understand how Rappler categorized all DUIs as drug-related. How would they know theyre all drug-related if an investigation is still ongoing in the first place?

And lastly, everyone suddenly use Buezas 7000 figure to describe the number of extrajudicial killings and summary executions, despite the fact that at least some of those killings must have been conducted in legitimate police operations.
This is just messed up! How many were lawfully killed during police operations? Did the PNP say all DUIs are drug-related? How many DUIs have been confirmed as drug-related? How many drug-related deaths are there in total?

Let me quote something thats often attributed to genius physicist Albert Einstein[QI]:
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
In Rapplers case, Bueza's formula is not only problematic, but also oversimplified.

The rest of mainstream media had almost a year to clear things up, but they appear to enjoy a willful ignorance on the matter. Some influential organizations have already called for economic sanctions against the Philippines, yet local mainstream media insists on displaying an appalling level of negligence reminiscent of the Malacaang Press Corps legendary indolence.

So why dont I, ThinkingPinoy, sort it out myself? 

Ironing out the definitions
But first, lets be clear about the definition of extrajudicial killings and summary executions

Senator Alan Peter Cayetano was right when he cited former President Benigno Aquino IIIs Administrative Order 35 to show the problematic definition of extra-judicial killings [Star].

There is no standard international definition of the term extrajudicial killings. Quoting Ballesteros of the [Manila Times], even UN bodies have interchangeably used the terms extrajudicial execution, summary execution and arbitrary execution to refer to intentional murders of crime suspects by law enforcers.
Hence, to ensure that you and I are on the same page, lets adopt the most common definition adopted the most vocal critics of the Duterte Administration  the Liberal Party-led Political Opposition. That is, for the purpose of this article, our preliminary definition shall be:
An extrajudicial killing is the drug-related killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process.
This is, a working definition, but I feel that its incomplete, as it precludes unknown vigilante groups that the opposition alleges to have committed drug-related killings with the States imprimatur. Thus, we shall revise the definition into:
An ""extrajudicial killing or summary execution"" shall be defined as the drug-related killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process, or by civilians with the explicit approval of the State.
Drug-related killings shall be defined as homicides where the suspect, the victim, or the suspects motive has a history of, or is connected to, illegal drugs.
This shall be the the definition used for the rest of this article.

Lets get the numbers, shall we?

PNP speaks
Instead of speculating, I decided to go to Camp Crame and ask the Public Information Office of the Philippine National Police (PNP-PIO) about it. A couple of days ago, I visited PNP-PIO and interviewed Police S/Supt. Dionardo Caloy Carlos, the PNPs official spokesperson.


Asked to confirm Rapplers 7,080 drug war body count, Carlos said:
The media reports over 7,000 extrajudicial killings and/or summary executions, thats their description, but we only have 6,011 homicide cases recorded from 01 July 2016 to 24 March 2017. These (homicide cases are) formerly (called) DUIs, or deaths under investigation.
Carlos essentially meant that 7,000 EJKs and summary executions is impossible because there are only 6,011 documented homicides under investigation to begin with. That is, the total number of EJKs and summary executions, if any, should be less than 6,011.
To further elucidate his point, Carlos said
So, all killings that occurred while we're implementing the campaign vs drugs are classified as Deaths Under Investigation. but we don't necessarily say they're all drug-related, that's why they're under investigation.
Asked if drug-related deaths are just a subset of DUIs, Carlos said:

Yes. Now, we are determining which ones are really connected to the anti-drug campaign and which ones are regular crimes.
Asked on how many of the DUIs have been confirmed as drug-related, Carlos said:
Among these 6,011 homicides, we have determined that there are only 1,398 cases that are drug-related, so its automatically wrong to say that there have been over 7,000 EJKs or summary executions that they attribute to the campaign versus illegal drugs There are names of victims, suspects, places, and not just numerical data.
Carlos said there are 1,398 confirmed drug-related homicides, but these killings have yet to be proven to be state-sanctioned.

To clarify the 1,398 confirmed drug-related homicides, Carlos said:
These are not necessarily deaths resulting from EJKs or summary executions. There are many possible motives. And among these 6,011 homicide cases, we so far determined that only 1,398 are drug-related.
In reference to Rapplers tally, Carlos said:
Its wrong to say that all 6,011 are EJKs or summary killings (executions) because the circumstances surrounding each of the 6,011 deaths differ. The motives vary.
I told Carlos that if there are 1,398 confirmed drug-related homicides among the 6,011 DUIs, that leaves us 4,613 DUIs that are still unaccounted for, to which he replied:
Aside from the 1398 (confirmed drug-related deaths), we also have 828 resolved cases but the motives are different, not connected to illegal drugs... (The motives are) fights over parcels of land, personal grudges, atrocities of armed leftists, love triangles, (etc.) ... We still have (around) 3700 cases that are still under investigation.
Subtracting 1,398 drug-related and 828 non-drug-related deaths from the 6,011 DUIs yields 3,785 DUIs with pending investigations.

Over 7,000 killed in Drug War?
I compiled the numbers Carlos provided and theyre shown in the following table:


In line with our definition of EJKs and summary executions, the oft-repeated statement over 7,000 EJKs and summary executions in Dutertes Drug War, which would have included all 6,011 DUIs per Buezas formula, is incorrect.
First, the 828 deaths that are not related to drugs are obviously not part of the War on Drugs.

Second, the 1398 drug-related deaths may be EJKs or summary executions, but it is still unclear if the killings were state-sanctioned.
Third, the remaining 3,785 DUIs are still being investigated upon, so it is still unknown if theyre related to drugs or not.
Thus, how can we say that these 6,011 are EJKs or summary executions when the essential elements of such a crime have yet to be proven?

In short, Rapplers article that features Buezas calculations provide, at best, an upper limit of potential EJKs and summary executions, and not the actual number of EJKs and summary executions.

But that makes Rapplers oft-cited article meaningless, which is best explained through an analogy:
I am technically correct when I say, I have, at most, a million fingers is technically correct because I have ten fingers and ten is less than one million. But is that statement meaningful? Does it help others get a better idea of how many fingers I have?
Rappler did the same thing. Rappler basically showed that there are, at most, 7,080 extrajudicial killings and summary executions, even if the actual number of proven extrajudicial killings, so far is a lot, lot lower.

Less than or equal to two
How many EJKs and summary killings in the Philippines so far? Less than or equal to two.

So far, there are only two clear candidates of EJKs and summary executions: that of Korean national Jee Ick-Joo and that of Mayor Rolando Espinosa.

According to Carlos, Jee Ick-Joos murder was found out to be a classic robbery-extortion case thats unrelated to drugs, with the culprits using the War on Drugs only as a camouflage.

Again: Jee Ick-Joos murder is not part of the War on Drugs.
Meanwhile, warrants of arrest have been issued for the suspects in Espinosas murder [Star], and the 19 suspects  all of them policemen  have surrendered [Star]. Their cases are still being heard in the local courts so under the presumption of innocence, they are still considered innocent until proven guilty.

For arguments sake, however, lets assume that the Espinosa slay is indeed an EJK or summary execution, then let me ask:
Does one clear case of EJK or summary execution warrant the international outrage against the Philippine Government today? 
Does it warrant the imposition of economic sanctions that can destroy millions of Filipino lives?
Why did Rappler say that the PNP gave a 7,080 EJK or summary execution body count even if the PNP clearly didnt do so?
Rapplers Willful Negligence?
Asked on what the PNP has done to correct Rapplers monumental error, Carlos said:
When we saw it after the first three months of the Duterte Administration, we wrote to Rappler so they can correct it They did nothing.
Asked about the date of that letter, Carlos said:
September 2016.
Carlos said Rapplers news desk did not just ignore PNPs letter, it even had the temerity to update that badly written article SEVENTY-FIVE TIMES.

Asked on what corrections they requested from Rappler, Carlos said:
We saw that the Rappler article shows different figures, and they claim the data comes from the PNP. (We avoid incidents like these) thats why we have an analysis portion every time we release information, so you cant just make up an interpretation of the numbers given. So Rappler didnt we didnt receive a reply pertaining to (the September 2016 letter).
Asked on what other measures PNP takes to avoid confusions like these, Carlos said:
Whenever I give them updates, I myself insert an accompanying note stating Deaths Under Investigation are not automatically extrajudicial killings and these are crimes of murder and/or homicide that are still being investigated on.
Carlos was referring to regular updates given to journalists covering the Camp Crame Beat. 

Camp Crame is the central headquarters of the Philippine National Police.

Seemingly exasperated over Rapplers chronic non-action, Carlos added:
How can they say differently when clearly, every time that I release the data, we put something like that (a note) there? It's more like questioning and playing with the use of words. They interpret it differently (from) the intention of the one that crafted the policy.
Bewildered by Rapplers logic, Carlos said:
If that's how (Rappler) sees it, then all crimes in 2016 before Duterte took office and in 2015 under a different leadership... ...so all of those are EJKs, going by their interpretation.
Presumption of Regularity
According to Carlos, 2,694 deaths resulted from legitimate police operations as of 05 April 2017, but they can neither be counted as extrajudicial killings nor summary executions because they were committed in the course of legitimate law enforcement operations.

Killings committed in the course of law enforcement operations are considered as justifiable homicides on the ground of self-defense, in accordance with President Rodrigo Dutertes oft-repeated directive:
Only if your life is in danger and the criminal is armed and hostile, shoot him [TP: Deaths].
Dutertes directive is in line with established law enforcement practices. For example, the directive merely resonated T.F. Martin and L.L. Priars 1955 paper Police Techniques in Gun Fights, published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology [Martin & Priar 1955, p. 401], which states:
Shoot only when life is in danger or a vicious felon cannot be apprehended. In case of an escaping felon, shoot as a last resort and when all means of apprehension have failed. In case of a firearm assault against the police, always shoot to kill.
Now, critics of Dutertes War on Drugs may argue that some of the 2,694 deaths must be extrajudicial killings or summary executions. However, the legal principle of presumption of regularity applies.
Presumption of regularity is a principle applied in evidentiary evaluation that transactions made in the normal course of business are assumed to have been conducted in the usual manner unless there is evidence to prove otherwise [US Legal].
That is, this globally-recognized legal principle implies that the 2,694 deaths are justifiable homicides, unless the critics manage to prove otherwise.

The problem, however, is that these critics never even attempted to file a single case against any policeman. The judiciary has shown a history of openly defying the Chief Executive [TP: Duterte vs Sereno], so these critics cannot claim unwillingness of the courts to hear these cases.

In the absence of evidence showing abuse of authority on the PNPs part, all these 2,694 deaths, except possibly for the death of Mayor Rolando Espinosa, are considered lawful.

So how many EJKs or summary executions are there?

One, at most, so far.

Why the international rage?
Despite the lack of evidence, relying solely on Dutertes fiery rhetoric, and without fully consulting the PNP, the opposition, led by vice-president Leni Robredo, propagated the grossly inaccurate death toll figure that genius Rappler employee Michael Bueza computed.

Michael Bueza, the same genius who not-so-subtly insinuated that Bilibid inmates could not have contributed to Senator Leila de Limas campaign because theyre not on the contributor list.
None of the contributors to the senator's 2016 campaign have been mentioned by the witnesses in the congressional inquiries on the reported drug trade inside Bilibid [Rappler].
Bueza is seriously a piece of work, along with his overlords Maria Ressa, Glenda Gloria, and Chay Hofilea, who allowed the publication of the article and its SEVENTY-FIVE updates.

This is the problem when a local news outfit is funded by foreigners. They need not care about customer feedback, because no matter how much they hemorrhage money, they still got lots in store. Screw accountability, screw dismal social media performance: all Rappler needs is good Search Engine Optimization and it can spread its fake news far and wide [TP: SPO4 Pia].

What's more worrisome is that NOBODY in mainstream media, except for the Manila Times, bothered to investigate this journalistic monstrosity.

Fitch Ratings and #MediaBias: ABS-CBN twists good news to make PH look bad,"How newswriters spin good news about the country to make the country look bad.
I was browsing through my news feed when I stumbled upon a recently published ABS-CBN News article entitled, Fitch affirms PH investment grade score under Duterte.

The article's first line reads:
Fitch Ratings... affirmed its investment grade rating with a positive outlook on the Philippines, citing sustained economic growth momentum under President Rodrigo Duterte.
Fitch evaluates sovereign credit ratings every six months, so the the last Fitch press release was on September 2016, covering the last three months of Pres. Aquino's term and the first three months of Duterte's.


Hence, I was immediately delighted because this is the first six-month evaluation period that's fully within Duterte's presidential term.

But then, the same ABS-CBN News article stated:
However, 'weak governance standards,' a narrow revenue base and per capita income and human development that are below the median for economies with similar ratings constrain the Philippines' score, Fitch said.
Yes, ABS-CBN said the credit rating agency cited the country's weak governance standards, and it even used quotation marks to emphasize the point.

That line saddened me, of course, as it seems to not-so-subtly reference the alleged 7000 body count from the War on Narcopolitics, which originated from Rappler's 7000-EJK hoax.

Then, I wondered, Did Fitch really say 'weak governance standards'?

So I went to Fitch's site to check the press release for myself.

Parang may karga na naman 'tong article e.

Fitch's Official Press Release
I went to Fitch.com and checked the official press release entitled, Fitch Affirms the Philippines at 'BBB-'; Outlook Positive.

The paragraph where that line was lifted from reads:
The ratings remain constrained by relatively weak governance standards, a narrow government revenue base, and levels of per capita income and human development that are below the 'BBB' median.
Thus, I cannot help but ask:
Why did ABS-CBN emphasize weak government standards through quotation marks, while quoting the other factors  verbatim  without quotation marks, and why did it leave the crucial adverb relatively?
As you can see from the Fitch press release, weak governance standards was listed alongside the other factors without any clear distinction on which is more important than the other. ABS-CBN newswriters, however, not-so-subtly emphasized it as if Fitch declared that it's the most serious constraint.
Moreover, the adverb relatively is crucial in painting a clear picture of what Fitch said about the Philippine governance, a crucial adverb that ABS-CBN news decided to drop.

Relatively, which means in relation, comparison, or proportion to something else is crucial because it clarifies whether Philippine Governance is weak as it is, or if it is weak compared to other similar sovereign states.

Think of it this way...

According to ""Forbes Philippines 50 Richest"", the three richest Filipinos individuals are Henry Sy ($13.7b), John Gokongwei ($6.8b), and Lucio Tan ($4.9b), and rounding up the list are Juliette Romualdez ($155m), Michael Romero ($150m), and Luis Virata ($145m).

Thus, among this group of 50 richest Filipinos, Virata is relatively poor, as the other 49 on the list posted higher respective net worths. Clearly, Virata is by no means destitute, i.e. Virata was labelled poor only because everyone else in the list were richer.
And the same thing applies to the Fitch press release. Fitch said the Philippines suffers from relatively weak governance standards, a description that Fitch also used for Malaysia [Straits]. Surely, Malaysia, despite its domestic problems, is nowhere near being failed state.

Pero syempre, ABS-CBN writers and editors will just reply, ""EH, BASTA!""

Semantic nitpicking?
Interestingly, reports by its local rivals Businessworld, BusinessMirror and GMA News didn't forget to quote relatively.

ABS-CBN's failure to quote relatively and its choice of emphasizing weak governance standards could have been easily attributed to innocent typographical errors and not from the news writer's biases, if not for the fact that the same article stated:
A ""deterioration"" in governance standards and political instability could cause a downgrade of the positive outlook to stable, Fitch said.
Kung hindi pa ba naman halatang ipinupukpok sa atin 'yan, ewan ko na lang.
Moreover, ABS-CBN all-too-conveniently forgot to quote the part where Fitch said:
The president's election campaign focused on improving law and order and promoting social justice, and he has maintained those priorities since taking office. Macroeconomic performance has remained strong despite the increase in incidents of violence associated with the administration's campaign against the illegal drug trade while domestic political stability has been maintained.
Yes, despite the alleged increase in violence, Fitch still said the Philippines enjoys domestic political stability... and ABS-CBN didn't report that.
SIDE NOTE: Alan Peter Cayetano 
Malacanang insiders informed me that Fitch representatives interviewed local officials recently, in preparation for their March 2017 report. 
The same person told me that Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez told Fitch that they must interview Senator Alan Peter Cayetano before they leave for Hong Kong. According to my source, Dominguez told Fitch that even if Cayetano is not an economist, he's the best person to talk to when it comes to the War on Narcopolitics. 
Suffice it to say, Cayetano might just have helped improve our economic prospects despite the negative propaganda from the opposition, including fake statistics from the Vice-president Leni Robredo.

Intentionally Negative Wording?
ABS-CBN's drama doesn't end there.

I checked Fitch's September 2016 statement about Philippine Sovereign credit, which said the Philippines had a BBB- credit rating with a stable outlook [Star]. Thus, it can be said that the country's credit rating has shown signs of improvement after six months as the March 2017 press release said we now have a BBB- credit rating with a POSITIVE outlook.

Despite this, ABS-CBN not only failed to mention that development in the article's title, but also in the article's body.

Curiously, during the last time Fitch changed our outlook from stable to positive in 2015 under the Aquino presidency, ABS-CBN optimistically titled its article,PH seen to get credit rating upgrade from Fitch.
Would it kill ABS-CBN's news writer to use an equally optimistic title, or 
Would ABS-CBN news editors kill that writer if he did, or most importantly, 
Would ABS-CBN's owners kill its news department if it did?
I don't know if it's just me, but the the writer's inclination to cite only the negative parts of this report suggest an agenda.

All of these is Duterte's fault: he is not an Aquino. #Sarcasm. For one, PNoy-era DBP wrote off P1.6 billion in Lopez loans [Inq], and Duterte is clearly unwilling to extend ABS-CBN a similar favor.

At this rate, maybe Duterte should really let ABS-CBN's franchise automatically expire in 2020. 

Despite these heavily-spun articles, mainstream media men still wonder why they consistently receive major ass-whooping in social media. 

Oh, wait! Varona insists that all uproar in social media is just ""manufactured noise"".

"People vs Robredo: Leni counter-attacks, cries ""persecution""","Will Robredo's impeachment backfire on Duterte?

In Friday's The Impeachment Numbers Game: Will Leni and Bolet enjoy South Africa?, I explained how the presence of a Lower House supermajority makes the transmittal of Articles of Impeachment against Vice-president Leni Robredo almost certain. I also explained how the prosecution, in a prospective Robredo impeachment trial, has pretty decent chances of getting a two-thirds majority conviction, as 18 out of the 24 sitting senators belong to the majority.

I have explained several other things in the same article, but the gist of the entire thing is this:

Vice-president Leni Robredo is facing a very real threat to her hold on power.

On the other hand, we all know that an impeachment complaint against President Rodrigo Duterte will not prosper for three reasons:
First, Duterte enjoys the support of the supermajority and the House Speaker, so that the transmittal of anti-Duterte Articles of Impeachment will require a congressional coup, something that typically spineless congressmen are incapable of. 
Second, even if a senate trial were to ensue, Duterte enjoys the support of the 18-member senate majority bloc. Moreover, at least 9 senators will certainly acquit Duterte:  Cayetano, Duterte's 2016 running mate;  Pimentel,  Zubiri and  Pacquiao, the Mindanawons;  Gordon and  Lacson have been generally supportive of Duterte and vocal about it;  Villar, whose son [TP: Mark Villar] is Duterte's Public Works Secretary;  Ejercito, whose father Erap strongly supports Duterte; and;  Binay, whose father, ex-VP Jojo Binay, hates the Liberal Party's guts, and the last thing she'd want is another LP presidency. 
Thus, a two-thirds conviction against Duterte is impossible.

Third, Duterte is currently a very popular president, and his removal will inevitably result into mass unrest. Imagine a repeat of Duterte's Miting de Avance but with an angry mob this time.
In short, vis-a-vis the impeachment complaints against the two highest-ranking officials in the land, Duterte is certainly safe, while Robredo is certainly in great danger of losing her post.

I think it's safe to say that Duterte will not be impeached, so let's focus on the Robredo impeachment issue.

Public Clamor for Robredo's Impeachment
According to WeAreSocial's Digital in 2017 Global Review [WaS 2017], the Philippines experienced an astounding 25% growth (12 million new users) in number of social media users compared to the past year. There are 60 million Filipinos active on Facebook right now, compared to about 48 million a year ago [WaS 2016], or an increase of about 12 million users.
With a national population of a little over 100 million, approximately 60 percent of the country use Facebook and with ease of access, Facebook has become the primary battleground of political discourse...and VP Robredo is being clobbered in it round-the-clock. For example, a quick look at the most popular political pages can be depressing from the Robredo camp's vantage point:

The Facebook Insights snapshot shown above, taken on 26 March 2017 at 12:00 PM UTC+8, lists the analytics data of the most popular pages of each political camp based on likes and engagements.

The anti-Robredo pages in the list are Thinking Pinoy, Mocha Uson Blog, and For the Motherland  Sass Rogando Sasot. Meanwhile, the pro-Robredo pages in the list are Leni Robredo's official page, Friend of VP Leni, Juan Nationalist, Silent No More, and Superficial Gazette.

Note that I did not include pro-Robredo pages with negligible engagement rates, i.e. those with below 100 thousand. And for brevity, I also didn't include other major anti-Robredo pages like Lapu-lapu, Duterte Today, Mindanation, and Crabbler.

Partidahan na natin, kumbaga.

The combined engagement rates of all five major pro-Robredo pages is less than 800 thousand, while the combined engagement rates of the three major anti-Robredo pages is around 4.4 million.

Suffice it to say, if Facebook were to be used as a gauge of public clamor for Robredo's removal, then yes, Filipinos want Robredo ousted.

Now, Robredo die-hards may argue that, despite the enormous disparity between the pro- and anti-Robredo stats, all of these numbers are just, as a self-proclaimed veteran journalist puts it, manufactured noise.

So let's check the other signs

Crowdsourced Funding for #PalitBise
A couple of weeks ago, pro-Duterte musician Jimmy Bondoc and company thought of organizing a mass demonstration in support of President Duterte who, at the time, was besieged by an impeachment complaint lodged by Trillanes-aligned Magdalo party-list Rep. Gary Alejano.

Bondoc named the April 2 event Palit Bise: Suporta sa Presidente, which roughly translates to Replace the Vice(-president): Support for the President.

Okay, I think you know what that means... then Bondoc did something unprecedented: he turned to crowdfunding to finance the event, arguing that the demonstration must not involve the support (or present) of any traditional politician.
On the evening of 20 March 2017, Bondoc launched a crowdfunding campaign for #PalitBise with a goal amount of US$20,000, or roughly Php 1 million. Bondoc said the amount will be used to pay for the sound system, security, and other miscellaneous expenses of what is anticipated to be a massive event.

Bondoc's call for donations was shared by OFW groups, Duterte-aligned social media pages, and private citizens.

In just three days, crowdsourced donations reached a total of US$45,640.49 [GavaGives] or about Php 2.3 million, exceeding the goal by over 128 percent.
There are more than 1079 givers but due to numerous DDoS attacks on the website caused a bug on the counter.

Save for a couple or so donations of $1,000, all other contributions were very small at around $30.

Let's take a look at the messages from some of the donors:



Graze Sequerra, who donated $4, wrote:
This is the first time nationalism gets (sic) through me. For the Motherland! And for my support for PRRD  nasa likod mo lang kami (we stand behind you). #ImpeachLeni #PalitBise


Sherry Mae Embay, who donated $20, wrote:

TRANSLATION: As an ordinary Filipino, I am taking a stand to fight for the future of my country and my would-be children.)


Alma Tahil, who donated $38.40, wrote:

TRANSLATION: For the voiceless and the destitute and for our beloved President... President Duterte, you're our country's last hope. So even if I can contribute only a small amount, I hope this will help protect you so you can continue your work for the poor.
All the other donors shared similar sentiments: support for the president and contempt for the vice-president.

The April 2 #PalitBise rally will be first crowdfunded mass demonstration in Philippine History.

Now, what does that say about the public's stance on the Robredo Impeachment Issue?

Risks with Impeaching Robredo
A turnout of at least 100,000 warm bodies in Luneta in the April 2nd #PalitBise Rally will galvanize the notion that there is indeed public clamor for Robredo's removal. A turnout of 200,000 can even sway some anti-impeachment senators' opinions. And finally, a turnout of 500,000 or more can make Robredo's removal practically inevitable.

But the issue is not as simple as taking away the vice-presidency from Our Lady of Naga, as Robredo's international propaganda machinery can spin this prospective removal to their favor.

Actually, Robredo's counter-attack has already commenced.
In a speech in Dagupan yesterday, Robredo said, The leadership journey [on which] I have embarked has brought me much persecution. There are so many lies being bandied around. And social media has been the frontier to disguise lies as true (sic) [Inq]

Robredo has started painting herself as the martyr persecuted by the powerful Duterte administration. With the help of the Liberal Party's massive financial war chest, she has the option to repeatedly hammer this notion ad nauseam to the international community for the duration of a potentially months-long impeachment trial.


And I think I forgot to mention that LP's funds for international PR is likely to receive a boost next week, when Leni flies to South Africa to meet the international Liberal Democrats (LibDem), thanks to LP's German LibDem financier Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung fr die Freiheit (Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom) [Freiheit].

Yes, the potential side-effect of removing Robredo is the reinforcement of Duterte's international image as a ruthless despot.

Uh, oh!

Countering Robredo's Counter-attack
Robredo's counter-attack looks promising, but it is by no means fool-proof. For pro-impeachment forces to counter this counter-attack, a two-pronged solution is necessary:
First, Duterte should distance himself from the impeachment issue as much as possible.
This allows him to wash his hands by arguing, during and after the impeachment process, that Robredo's removal is purely the work of the People and that he had nothing to do with it.
Second, the Filipino People should visibly and massively show its support for Robredo's removal. 
The best rebuttal to Robredo's and Varona's prospective manufactured noise spin is a photo that looks similar to this:

Duterte's May 2016 campaign rally at Quirino Grandstand, Luneta

Duterte, so far, has been doing his part  the first prong  through the following acts:
 On 23 March, Duterte told his supporters to stop any attempt at impeaching Robredo [TV5]. 
 A day later, he asked Robredo to sit next to him during the PNPA graduation ceremony [GMA]. 
 Yesterday, Malacanang confirmed that Duterte invited the Robredo family to dinner in the palace [ABS].
Thus, the ball is already in the people's court, i.e. it's time for the Filipino People to do its part: the second prong.

If you want Robredo to be removed with minimal side effects, I highly suggest that you join the 02 April #PalitBise: Suporta sa Presidente mass demonstration in Luneta, and continue to voice your opinions on the streets and in social media for the duration of the impeachment trial.

Remember that Article II, Section 1 of the Philippine Constitution states [Gov]:
The Philippines is a democratic and republican State. Sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them.
With that said, don't you think it's time for us to have a say on who stays in power and who does not?

If Vice-president Leni Gerona viuda de Robredo y querida de Banal will go, then she will have to go for good .",RJ Nieto,"March 26, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/03/impeach-leni-robredo-counter-attacks.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
The Impeachment Numbers Game: Will Leni and Bolet enjoy South Africa?,"It appears that Leni Robredo can look forward to several sleepless nights while on her South African escapade with Fafa Bolet next week.

In retaliation to Leni Robredo's controversial UN/DRCNet video and Trillanes' Duterte impeachment complaint, House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez first mentioned his plans to impeach Robredo on 17 March 2017 [ABS]. Alvarez's stance wasn't very definitive at that time, until his word war with Robredo escalated on 20 March 2017 [ABS].

Yes, on that day, the prospect of a Robredo impeachment trial  and subsequent removal  has become oh so real.

How did LP react?
Prior to Alvarez' March 20 anti-Robredo remarks, LP was largely silent about the Duterte's impeachment case, essentially leaving all the acoustic tasks to Trillanes, its de facto attack dog. However, after Alvarez demonstrated his resolve on the 20th, LP's rhetorical strategy changed.

On 21 March 2017, Deputy Speaker Miro Quimbo, an LP stalwart, declared that House LP's will not support Trillanes' anti-Duterte impeachment complaint. Quimbo knows that his statement this is more of a symbolic gesture than anything else, considering that a vast majority of LP's members have bolted to PDP-Laban to form a supermajority in as early as June last year [TP: Plan B].

And what does it symbolize?

The Liberal Party essentially says that they want a truce vis-a-vis impeachment. They know that the numbers are not in their favor.

Then the picture got even clearer two days later.

On 23 March 2017, Vice-president Leni Robredo, LP's chairperson, said,Impeachment whether against the President or me would put a halt to the things Congress should focus on. It is going to be very divisive in our country. It wont be good in the long run [Inq].

Why the sudden opposition to impeachment after Alvarez floated the idea of a counter-attack? Because LP knows that the the administration have the numbers in congress, the crucial numbers that it painfully does not have.
LP, or at least that part of LP that still supports Robredo, is deathly scared of losing the vice-presidency, and this fear arising from the lack of numbers is best evidenced by a statement from no less than Robredo legal counsel Barry Gutierrez.

Gutierrez said yesterday, I would still like to believe that when members of congress vote, they do so with that in mind... Otherwise, if you sayeven if it's practically trueif you cynically say it's just numbers... [Star]

Yes, Gutierrez acknowledged that there's a pretty good chance that Leni will be impeached by the Lower House.

But wait, what impeachment complaints are we talking about?

Impeachment Complaints and Duterte's Opposition
At least two impeachment complaints will have been filed before May 4th, or the start of the next congressional session: one from Atty. Oliver Lozano [Star], and another from the group of lawyers and academics [Inq].

We can dismiss Oliver Lozano's complaint because he's just a serial filer, i.e. he files these just for the sake of filing and, sources say, with little regard to the substance of the complaints. Case in point: he has filed impeachment complaints against every president after Marcos, none of which got past the House Justice Committee.

There's also a pretty good chance that House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez will file the third impeachment complaint [TV5].
Upon his arrival from a State Visit to Myanmar and Thailand, President Rodrigo Daddy D Duterte has made his position on the matter clear: he doesn't want Leni impeached.

Look, we just had an election. Guys, lay off. Stop it. You can do other things but do not tinker with the structure of government. I will not countenance (support) it, Duterte said [CNN].

Despite this pronouncement, Speaker Alvarez decided to defy the President when he said in Filipino, I respect the President's statement. We may agree with him on many issues, but this time, we disagree with him [Star].

Ano ba talaga, Daddy D?

At first glance, I think many Filipinos received mixed signals from the Duterte Administration. On one hand is Duterte's opposition to Leni's impeachment, and on the other is Alvarez' open defiance to the president's wishes, i.e. Alvarez wants Leni impeached.

Okay, hold on one second.

From Lower to Upper
Duterte said he doesn't want Leni impeached, but one of his men  DILG Assistant Secretary for Plans and Programs Epimaco Densing [DILG]  was actually part of the panel of lawyers and academics in yesterday's press Impeach-Leni conference [TV5].

Well, that says something.

Yes, one of the President's men is supporting one of the sets of impeachment complaints. Either Densing is a rogue bureaucrat, or a part of Duterte wants Leni removed, despite the other part calling for the preservation of the status quo.

Whatever the case may be, the Alvarez-led Lower House supermajority [Star] makes one thing clear: Articles of Impeachment will most probably be transmitted to the Senate in as early as May 4th, that day when the Lower House resumes its regular session. Yes, at the rate things are going, an impeachment trial is almost certain, and it's just a matter of time before it commences.

With that said, I think it's important for you, the reader, to have a better idea of the political scenarios that may ensue post-transmittal because unfortunately, the situation is not as simple as Let's kick Leni out then business as usual.

No. It's not that simple. Let me explain the why and the how.

Another Numbers Game in the Senate
Let's assume that the one of the impeachment complaints (or a consolidated complaint) will be transmitted to the Senate as Article of Impeachment.

The Senate will form an impeachment court after it receives the Articles of Impeachment from the the House of Representatives. The constitution says the Chief Justice will preside if the one on trial is the President [Gov] but it's the vice-president on trial this time, so Senate President Aquilino Koko Pimentel will preside.
OFFTOPIC: That's kinda unfortunate. It would have been fun if it's Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno. Her EQ is so low, her biases will surely show, exposing her to public scrutiny.
Historically, the impeachment trial commences a month after the transmittal. Assuming that the complainants manage to get 100 votes (the required one-third equals 99 votes then let's just add 1 as insurance) right away, the transmittal will be on May 4th (start of congressional session), so we can expect an impeachment trial to commence on or before mid-June. We can also expect the impeachment trial to last for at least two months.

Let's skip the impeachment hearings for now and zoom to the day of reckoning, or the day the senator-judges cast their votes.


A conviction requires a two-thirds majority vote from the Senate [Const]. With 24 senator-judges, that means 16 convict votes are required to remove Robredo. There are sixteen non-LP senators in the generally pro-Administration Senate Majority, 2 LP senators in the majority (Recto and Villanueva), and six in the minority (De Lima, Aquino, Pangilinan, Hontiveros, Trillanes, and Drilon).

At this point, we shall modestly assume that all minority senators, plus the other two LP senators, will vote acquit.


This is a precarious situation, as we will never know if one of the 16 senator-judges from the majority will vote convict, or if some of them will suddenly decide to vote acquit.

For one, majority Senator JV Ejercito expressed his opposition to both Duterte's and Robredo's impeachment, saying that impeachment processes are both destructive and divisive [Gov], suggesting that he may vote to acquit Robredo should a trial ensue. That brings down the maximum number of convict votes to just 15, one short of a two-thirds majority.

However, Ejercito is just a first-time senator whose term ends in 2019 [Gov], i.e. he's up for re-election in 2019. What political gain will there be for him if he acquits Robredo?

Ejercito voting to acquit Robredo would be political suicide, although it's up to the Filipino public to make him realize it at the soonest. The same goes for the other re-electionist majority senators... and there's a lot of them.

Yes, the prosecution has the opportunity, but it faces a tough road ahead.

Potential Temporary Allies
However, senate sources told me that there's a chance that Senators Ralph Recto and Joel Villanueva, despite still being part of the minority Liberal Party, may be convinced to vote convict.

My senate sources told me that Recto is unhappy with the Liberal Party since the time former Pres. Aquino vetoed his bills (e.g. the January 2016 SSS Pension Hike Law) in the previous congress. The same source told me that Recto has become an LP pariah, as he was not even invited by other LP senators during their June-July discussions about who will become the Senate President.

Remember the time when administration-aligned Senator Manny Pacquiao recently chose to nominate Recto as Senate Pro-tempore [GMA] after the majority ousted LP Senators from their chairmanships? Yes, that's a clue.


Meanwhile, Senator Joel Villanueva has always had bad blood with Senator Leila de Lima, who recommended the filing of graft charges against the former when the latter was still Justice Secretary [Star].

Yes, Villanueva and Recto, with a little prodding from administration party PDP-Laban, may vote convict, bolt LP and join PDP or some other party.

After all, despite their being in LP, they still chose to remain in the Senate majority.

Fewer than 23 Senator-judges?
Senator Leila de Lima, however, is currently in detention and I see no reason how she will be freed in the next three months, so it's safe to assume that she will not be a senator-judge, considering that Trillanes was not allowed to participate in sessions of the 15th Congress (2007 to 2010) prior to his 2010 pardon, courtesy of then-President Noynoy Aquino.

With that said, there will be at most 23 senators who will decide on the case. Two-thirds of 23 is 15.33, so a conviction will still require 16 votes, as 15 votes is less than two-thirds.

Note, however, that I still used the term at most because...

...there's a catch, a very interesting catch.

Senator Antonio Sundalong Kanin Trillanes is known to be Edgar Matobato's protector, with the latter being in his custody up to now [TV5]. Thus, it's theoretically easy for the prosecution to argue Trillanes' lack of partiality and have him forcibly disqualified as a senator-judge under Sec 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court [AM].

Of course, he could voluntary inhibit but his reputation for arrogance makes that scenario unlikely. So yes, he has to be forcibly removed as a senator-judge.

Assuming that Trillanes does not participate by forcible disqualification, that leaves us with 22 Senator-judges, two-thirds of which is 14.67, so that a two-thirds majority vote will just be 15.

A 15-vote requirement to convict gives the sixteen-person senate majority (plus the two LP wildcards) provides the pro-impeachment side lots of wiggle room, i.e. it makes Robredo's removal much more likely.

Now, another source  one of the lawyers preparing the impeachment complaints  also told me that they can even potentially asked for the forcible disqualification of Franklin Drilon, after the lawyer claimed that they have evidence showing that Drilon helped fund or organize anti-Duterte black propaganda.

If Drilon will be disqualified as a senator-judge, that brings down the total number of judges to just 21, making a two-thirds majority vote equal to just 14, providing the pro-impeachment clique even stronger, though I doubt that the prosecution will push it this far because it may erode the legitimacy of the prospective impeachment court... although desperate times may call for desperate measures. Who knows?

Whichever the case, I think it's safe to say at this point that the odds are stacked against Leni Robredo, that a conviction is, at the least, slightly more likely than an acquittal.

TP's Takeaways
Let me summarize what I have discussed.

FIRST, Alvarez' fury and the Duterte-aligned supermajority makest Leni impeachment in the Lower House almost certain, i.e. a Senate Impeachment Trial is extremely likely.

SECOND, there are sixteen senators in the Duterte-aligned Senate majority, exactly the number required to convict Robredo. There's a risk however, that some of these majority senators like Ejercito may acquit Robredo, so it's still gonna be a tough task ahead for the prosecutors with this kind of setup.

THIRD, minority senators Recto and Villanueva, both disgruntled with LP, may convict Robredo if given the right deal by Duterte-aligned forces, so that total number of potential convict votes is 18.

FOURTH, the prosecution may move to disqualify Trillanes. With De Lima unable to participate due to detention, the total number of senator-judges is 22, so that only 15 votes are required for a two-thirds majority conviction. That provides more wiggle room for the prosecution because they can get a conviction even if three of the 18 senators choose to acquit Robredo.

Note, however, that two high-profile attorneys I consulted have differing opinions on the issue of inhibition/disqualification of senator judges. The first one said senator-judges may be forcibly disqualified, while the other argues that only voluntary inhibitions are possible per precedent.

Hence, the feasibility of this #ByeByeTrillanes scenario is still in question.

FIFTH, the prosecution may also move to disqualify Drilon, though unlikely. If the prosecution decides to push it this far, this brings the total number of senator-judges down to 21, so that only 14 votes are required for a two-thirds majority conviction. Yes, this will become very easy for the prosecution, although it brings with it the risk of irreparably eroding the credibility of the impeachment court.

Hence, even the worst-case scenario in a Robredo Impeachment Trial brings with it the real possibility of a two-thirds majority conviction, and the other scenarios only make the odds better.

Yes, the prospect of a Private Citizen Leni Robredo is becoming clearer by the day, and this will probably result into several sleepless nights for VP Leni Robredo and Fafa Bolet as they go on their South African escapade.

Now, it's time to look at the bigger picture:
What are the political risks that Duterte may face during and after Robredo's impeachment trial?
I'll save that for the next article. This one is already running long.",RJ Nieto,"March 24, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/03/the-impeachment-numbers-game-will-leni.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Robredo's ""Army of Truth"" vs Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano?","Data Security and the Internet really isn't the Liberal Party's strongest suit.


In Is Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano a PH citizen?, the Philippine Daily Inquirers Rodel Rodis, a US-based immigration attorney, cast aspersions on Senator Alan Peter Cayetano by questioning his citizenship.

Rodis prefaced his story by mentioning a Wikipedia article listing former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality, a list that contains Alan Peter Cayetano.

Yes, a lawyer-journalist citing Wikipedia. Yes, I know. Yes.

Rodis then went on to write:

As a child of a Philippine citizen father and a US citizen mother, Alan Peter was born as a citizen of both countries but, by the age of 21, he had to choose one or the other, and he chose US citizenship.

Rodis also claimed that the results of Cayetanos 2007 citizenship case lodged at the Comelec is unknown.

Rodis rambled throughout the article, even citing the presidential candidate Sen. Grace Poes COMELEC Case and also Yasays tiff with the Commission on Appointments.

He went on and on without even consulting Cayetano or even Google.

Google is a friend
A quick Google search shows that Comelec junked Capcos case in 2007.

Speaking on behalf of the Comelec en banc, then-Chairman Benjamin Abalos said, Weve finally decided to put an end to the citizenship issue of Congressman Cayetano affirming the resolution of the second division, meaning he is a natural-born Filipino. [GMA]""

At this point, I think its pretty clear that the issue has been settled.
Capcos choice not to raise the issue to the Supreme Court is Capcos problem, not Cayetanos.

I will not argue anymore about Cayetanos citizenship as I believe that Cayetano has clearly explained it in a statement published several hours after the Inquirer articles release [Cayetano].

Whats more interesting, I believe, is what happened behind the scenes.

Wikipedia and Disruptive Editing
Any self-respecting journalist, let alone a lawyer-journalist, refrains from citing Wikipedia as a source for the simple reason that Wikipedia is prone to disruptive editing.

Wikipedias user manual defines Disruptive Editing as a pattern of editing that disrupts progress toward improving an article or building the encyclopedia.

For example, a Wikipedia article youve read just now can be totally different from the same Wikipedia article youll read tomorrow.

And disruptive editing  if not outright vandalism is what exactly happened to the page that Rodis cited.

Let me explain that in a bit. Heres where it gets really fun!
To help guard against disruptive editing, each Wikipedia article has a View History tab, which allows readers to check the articles edit history, and thats what I did to the Wikipedia article List of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality.

Was the article edited recently?
The timestamps on each Wikipedia edit use the UTC+0 time zone. Meanwhile, Inquirer uses Manilas time zone (UTC+8).

UTC+8 is 8 hours ahead of UTC+0, so that Rodis Inquirer article,which was published at 1:21 AM of 16 March 2017 (UTC+8), was published at 1721 hrs (5:21 PM) of 15 March 2017 (UTC+0).

Now, heres a screencap of the recent changes in the Wikipedia article:
The latest edit is by RMS125A, a Wikipedia moderator, so there should be nothing fishy about that.

Whats interesting, instead, are the next two edits by a certain 202.78.90.129.

The Two Controversial Edits
You can edit Wikipedia articles without logging into an account. However, the system uses logs your IP address and shows it as your username. Clearly, those two edits were done by an amateur.

The first edit, shown below, was at 2030 hrs of March 15, where Alan Peter Cayetano was replaced with Ebenezer Ramos Bonbon. It appears that this was a typo error on the Amateur editors part, as he immediately edited it three minutes later.



The second edit was at 2033 hrs of March 15. This edit was much more extensive, as the editor virtually deleted everything about Cayetano, including all the reference links.
Now, why would someone delete the write-up about Cayetano?

Based on the time stamps, both edits were performed about 5 hours AFTER the publication of Rodis' Inquirer article.


A closer look at the deleted sections show that one of the references cited is a GMA News article indicating that the Comelec junked the case filed by Capco against Cayetano. Yes, that amateur editor, whoever he is, tried to save Rodis article, because leaving the Wikipedia article as it is would make Rodis Inquirer article fall flat on its face.

Yes, the amateur editor really needed to delete the reference links because the same Wikipedia article that Rodis cited would have been enough to debunk Rodis' own article.

Rodis the ""Lawyer""
But wait! How could something as simple as that slip Atty. Rodis eye?

Judging from reviews written by his former clients, Rodis is a crappy lawyer. Rodis' Avvo reviews indicate that he's ""unprofessional"", ""awful"", a ""nightmare"" and ""just horrible"" [Avvo].

Avvo is an online legal marketplace where users can post reviews of their experiences with lawyers.

One of Rodis' client reviews, written in 2014, reads [Avvo]:

""Rodel Rodis represented my family in a trust dispute, and came across as unprofessional in his correspondence, and significantly incredibly unknowledgeable regarding trust laws and litigation. He was embarrassing in his representation.""

Another 2013 review reads [Avvo]:

I had nightmare with this guy. Not responsive, nor responsible, and on top of these bad qualities, he does not catch up with current immigration law. It was often the case he could not answer my questions without looking at internet. Don't risk your life with this guy.

Is this the same reason why Rodis reportedly closed down his San Francisco offices [Yelp]? That is, he got so many negative Yelp reviews that he either  closed his Yelp page or  closed down his San Francisco office altogether?


But theres one question that we havent answered yet

Whos that amateur editor?
So far, we know two things:

1. That the editor mistakenly typed Ebenezer Ramos Bonbon into the article [Wiki]
2. That the editors IP address is 202.78.90.129

I tried to geolocate 202.78.90.129 and the online tool [IPLocation] yielded a (latitude, longitude) pair of (14.6627, 121.0328) which, in turn, translates to somewhere in Project 6, Quezon City [LatLong].

Internet service providers in the Philippines typically use dynamic IP addresses, so that a connected computers IP address may change over time. However, it would be safe to say that that that amateur editor was located somewhere in Northern Metro Manila when he edited the Wikipedia article.

So we have our first clue: hes somewhere north of Metro Manila.

Now, a quick google search using Ebenezer Ramos Bonbon CV yields, well, the CV were looking for [Scribd].

In particular, I found out that based on his 2011 CV, Mr. Bonbon lived in Northern Metro Manila.

A closer look at the CV shows that Bonbon is closely affiliated with Akbayan Youth. Bonbon must be very close to Akbayan because he even chose Akbayan Youths then international secretary, Prof. Adonis Elumbre, as a character reference.

Based on these data, I have a reasonable suspicion that the amateur editor is actually Mr. Bonbon.

After all, electronic data security is not the oppositions strongest suit, as shown in #LeniLeaks, where LP-aligned Global Filipino Diaspora Council were so careless that they unwittingly made their confidential email conversations available for public consumption.

But wait, Akbayan?
Yes, its Akbayan, the same political party with strong links with VP Leni Robredos Liberal Party. Senator Risa Hontiveros, an LP stalwart, is from Akbayan. The same goes with UP Professor Sylvia Claudio, the Rapplerette who penned the satirical article 10 Reasons Im now a Dutertian.

Yes, Akbayan and LP are practically the same.

Yes, it appears that an Akbayan member may have tried to cover up Rodis blunder to keep Rodis poorly-written and poorly-researched article viable for a longer period.

With that said, its logical to ask the following questions:

Is it really Bonbon who edited the article and if so, is he a part of Robredos Army of Truth?

For one, Rodis is part of the Diaspora Council, so that makes him part of Robredo's international propaganda machine, so does Ebenezer Bonbon work under Pete Silva?

"#NasaanAngPangulo: Mamasapano, Mar Roxas's ambition, and a PR operator","A close friend and I hung out for dinner with former National Youth Commissioner and former MTRCB Board Member Michael Mike Acebedo Lopez last week. Unsurprisingly, what started out as a small talk quickly shifted to conversation on politics, a conversation that is as juicy as it gets.

He said then Interior Secretary Mar Roxas, in a desperate attempt to salvage his presidential ambitions, engaged in a multi-million-peso PR campaign against then President Aquino, a campaign aimed at pinning all the blame over Mamasapano on Aquino.

These kinds of stories, my friends, is what I live for.

 But first, I think its important to give you a short background on the Mamasapano Clash.

Mamasapano 101
The 25 January 2015 Mamasapano Clash was a bloody confrontation between the PNP Special Action Forces (SAF) and the BIFF-MILF. Intended to kill or capture Malaysian terrorist Marwan, the clash led to the deaths of 44 SAF policemen, arguably a steep price to pay for the death of just one terrorist.

A bungled operation, the Mamasapano Clash was made more controversial by the fact that it was headed by Aquino and then PNP Chief Alan Purisima, who was suspended from service at the time. Interior Secretary Roxas, who had authority over the PNP, was reportedly not notified of the operation.


For oppositionists, the Mamasapano Clash became the symbol of incompetence of the Aquino Administration, with a sitting president opting to delegate authority to a suspended general and totally disregarding the Interior Secretary, despite the latters authority over the police.

Yes, Aquino left Roxas was out in the cold, making the latter appear inutile in the eyes of the general public.

And with a little over a year before the May 2016 Elections, Roxas much-delayed presidential ambitions have suddenly become under threat.

The dejected Roxas, who stepped aside in 2010 to allow Aquino to be the Liberal Party presidential bet, suddenly faced the prospect of having to delay his presidential hopes for another six years, given the massively negative PR fallout of the Mamasapano clash.

Now, lets go back to Mikes story.

Aquino vs Roxas vs Aquino 
The lifeless bodies of the slain SAF44 were transported back to Manila in the morning of 29 January 2016. Present to honor the slain policemen were former President Ramos, then Vice President Binay, and top officials of the military and the police. Aquino, who was widely being blamed for the incident, was conspicuously absent in the arrival ceremony, having opted to attend the inauguration of a Mitsubishi Plant in Laguna.

And heres where Lopezs story begins.

Lopez said a publicist-friend, a well-known figure in the political PR industry, contacted him later that afternoon.

The publicist-friend, whos fully aware of Lopezs chronic disdain for the Aquinos, asked Lopez for help in coming up with a list of anti-Aquino Twitter hashtags relating to the Mamasapano Clash, for use in a PR campaign to be launched at 6:00 PM of the same day.


That lady knows how I feel about PNoy, Lopez said.

Lopez said he vividly remembers all the events of that day because it was also when his mother was rushed to the hospital because of a medical emergency.
Lopez said he asked her about the purpose behind the request.

According to Lopez, she said Roxas DILG Chief of Staff Tomasito Villarin commissioned her to launch a PR campaign aimed at pinning the blame over Mamasapano onto Aquino, with the hope of minimizing the bad publicity that Villarins principal, DILG Sec. Roxas, would receive.

Lopez obliged and shortly thereafter, he sent the publicist-friend a list of 10 to 15 anti-Aquino hashtags.

The publicist-friend used one of the Twitter hashtags Lopez made.

The Twitter hashtag? #NasaanAngPangulo. (#WhereisthePresident).

#NasaanAngPangulo
Lopez said the anti-Aquino black propaganda campaign, instigated and funded by the Roxas camp, was launched later at 6:00 PM.

Lopez said his publicist-friend maintains a fleet of major social media influencers with hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of followers, enabling the latter to manipulate Twitter trending topics to her clients favor.


The hashtag quickly trended worldwide, creating over 500 million impressions, and with major evening newscasts TV Patrol, 24 Oras, and Bandila reporting about it later that night.
Lopez said since then, his publicist-friends PR firm reused this amazingly successful hashtag every time Aquino went missing in the middle of a crisis.

Lopez declined to name this publicist-friend, although he said shes very well known in political circles, and that shes popular for being one of the glitziest PR operators in the country.

Truth be told, Lopez didnt have to name her, as Lopez has provided me with enough information to find out who she is.

And thats what I did. But first, I had to make sure that Lopez isnt just making this all up.

Senyora Santibaez
Lopez said his publicist-friend pool of influencers include social media superstar Senyora, formerly known as Senyora Santibaez, the same Senyora whose Facebook Page was recently unpublished.

Incidentally, I know who Senyora is in real life, so I asked her about it.
Yes, THIS Senyora.
Senyora said she used to work with the PR firm that handled #NasaanAngPangulo, although she has cut ties with the company not long after that, citing the publicists habit of shortchanging her social media influencers.

Senyora admitted that she was asked to help trend #NasaanAngPangulo, although she wasnt able to focus on it because she was busy with school work at the time, so she wasnt compensated for the project.

Senyora is 21 years old as of this articles writing, and she was still in college when she was contacted regarding #NasaanAngPangulo.
Many major social media influencers make money through native ad placements, or advertisements that follow the influencers general theme so that followers will find it harder to distinguish it from regular postings.

For example, Senyora can crack a joke about corned beef, mentioning a particular brand of corned beef in the process. That brands manufacturer, through the PR firm, will then pay Senyora thousands of pesos for mentioning the brand. The problem, however, is that the PR firm handling #NasaanAngPangulo has a history of giving compensation in kind, and whose value is a lot lower that the going rate.

To cut the long story short, Senyora basically corroborated Lopezs claim that the latters publicist-friend handled #NasaanAngPangulo.

At this point, I am inclined to believe Lopezs story, but I am not done yet.

Let me ask the question: Who is Lopezs publicist-friend?

ThinkingPinoy investigates.

Scouring ThinkingPinoys Network
One of the things Lopez said was that his publicist-friend was a tattle-tale, i.e. she finds it difficult to keep her mouth shut. That is, she took ownership of the #NasaanAngPangulo hashtag project and in defiance of common sense, used it in sales presentations to other political camps.
I have gained an invaluable network of political contacts over the past year and half, so I contacted each of them. I specifically asked:

Has any PR firm ever shown you a sales presentation using #NasaanAngPangulo?.


Two camps said yes, and one of them even provided me a copy of the excel file that the PR firm gave them as part of the sales presentation.

The filename was CaseStudy2015.xls, and you can download it here.

Examining the Excel file
Of course, theres always the possibility that an excel file has been tampered with, if not totally fabricated. However, after right-clicking on the files icon and selecting Properties, and navigating to the Details tab, the following information was diplayed:


Let me re-type some of the information shown in the screenshot.
ORIGIN
Last saved by Joyce Ramirez
Program name Microsoft Macintosh Excel
Content Created 7/10/2011 6:49 PM
Date Last Saved 08/02/2015 2:41 PM
Content Created refers to when the file first existed. The original file couldve been an old excel spreadsheet template used for a new data set, so it wont matter. Whats more important, however, is the Date Last Saved field, which indicates that it was last saved on 02 August 2015, or about seven months after #NasaanAngPangulo trended worldwide.

Sounds just about right.

I created a copy of the same file and attempted to modify its document properties using MSExcel, but Excel does not allow changing Joyce Ramirez and the dates.

In short, I have good reason to believe that the file is authentic, and that it was originally created using the computer of a certain ""Joyce Ramirez"".

I asked Senyora if that PR firm lady is Joyce Ramirez.

Senyora said yes.

Who exactly is Joyce Ramirez
Based on her LinkedIn Profile:
Joyce A. Ramirez is the Lead Publicist of PR ASIA Worldwide - a leading entertainment PR and creative communications agency that works with a diverse roster of clients ranging from A-list global stars to content creators to consumer technology companies...
Meanwhile, based on PR Asia Worldwides LinkedIn Company Profile:
PR ASIA WORLDWIDE is the Philippines' leading ENTERTAINMENT and CELEBRITY PR agency. Founded by International Publicist Joyce A. Ramirez in 2004, the agency now represents some of the biggest brands in the world
According to the company websites about page:
PR Asia Worldwide (PR ASIA) is a leading publicity network with main headquarters located in Manila, Philippines with an international booking office in Los Angeles, California. The agency, recognized across Southeast Asia as the leading digital PR agency in the Philippines and one of the most popular PR firms in the region, is consistently recognized for its worldwide trending campaigns and unique, original executions.
Senyora confirmed that this is the same high profile publicist Joyce Ramirez that double-crossed her. The two political camps I contacted earlier also confirmed its her who delivered the presentation.

Meanwhile, Lopez refused to confirm that this is the same publicist friend, although his rather shocked facial expression gave it away.

What the Excel Sheet says
A look inside the excel file shows the title CASE STUDY: #NasaanAngPangulo .

The spreadsheet is divided into seven columns, namely:
1. MEDIA OUTLET, or where the PR material was published
2. SECTION, or the section of the media outlet where the material was published
3. CATEGORY, which is either Public Affairs or Opinion
4. COVERAGE, which can be TV, Online, Radio, or Print
5. PR VALUE, or the return on investment
6. TIME, or the airtime allotted for the PR material in cases of TV or Radio broadcasts
7. ONLINE LINKS, or references to help the prospective client verify the claim
According to the spreadsheet, the #NasaanAngPangulo project's Ron is US$2.45 million which, at the time, was equivalent to Php 107.8 million. A snapshot of a section of the spreadsheet is shown below:

First on the list is INTERXN 1800H ACTIVATION. INTERXN is Ramirezs network of social media influencers, while 1800H refers to the time of the campaigns activation, i.e. 6:00 PM.

Afterwards,  it was then picked up by mainstream media.

On the list were major newscasts of from the Big 3 TV networks.  Also the list were DZMM, Yahoo Philippines, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Abante Tonite, Pep Ph, Spot.Ph, Canadian Inquirer, FHM Online, Manila Standard Today, Philippine Star, Abante Online, Online, Global Voices, Tempo Online, Inquirer.Net, Philippine Star, Asian Journal, Philippine Star, Tempo, and ANC News, among others.

The spreadsheet is unclear about the methodology behind the PR value estimate.

However, by the sheer size of the list, I have reason to believe that at least some of employees of the abovementioned organizations benefitted from Ramirezs financial machinations.

Regardless of the fine print, I believe its safe to deduce that the Roxas Camps black propaganda against then President Aquino, despite its astronomic cost, was very effective in hammering the message that Aquino is to blame.

That is, its clear that as #NasaanAngPangulo entered public consciousness, Mars task of fending of criticism against him became much, much easier So what did Roxas do while this PR campaign was being rolled out?

After initially denying any knowledge of the Mamasapano operation before it took place, Roxas backtracked in February 2015 when he said that he knew of the operation and texted PNoy about it to which the latter replied, Thank you.

Why? Because Ramirez is already taking care of it?

Questions, Questions, Questions
These discoveries led me to ask the following questions:

First, just how desperate was Mar Roxas to become president?
While Ramirez supposedly claimed that Roxas right hand man Tom Villarin was her contact person, there is no way Villarin, who hails from LP-aligned partylist Akbayan, could have funded that operation. That is, Mar, the scion of a one of the richest families in the country, must have provided the money, right?

Is Mar so desperate to become president that he doesnt mind throwing delicadeza out the window? Mar screamed, Ituloy ang Daang Matuwid!, in May 2016 so what exactly did he mean with Daang Matuwid? Surely, spending millions of pesos in destroying a close ally via black propaganda isnt Daang Matuwid, right?

Second, up to what extent can mainstream media be manipulated?
I think its pretty clear that Ramirez operation is aimed at manipulating public discourse,  and that mainstream media fell prey to it. So, just how many times have the public been manipulated?  SURELY,  this is not the only project of this kind.

Is this the same technique used in the recent anti-Duterte media blitzes?  Just how much have these anti-Duterte media blitzes cost the opposition so far?

Its interesting to note that mainstream media has been on the offensive against bloggers, accusing the latter of lack of accountability and irresponsible reporting. This is despite the fact that they themselves fall prey to fake, manipulated news.

Third, how much does Leni Robredo know about this?
A person who wants to lead the country must, at the least, be cognizant of the internal struggles of her own political party. Surely, Leni Robredo, being the standard-bearer of the Liberal Party, should have known about this. Did she choose to run for VP even if she knew that her running mate, Roxas, was a backstabbing bitch?

Did Leni Robredo accept the VP nomination without batting an eyelash, or was she totally clueless about this issue, just like most other issues facing the country today?


Epilogue
The English author and satirist Douglas Adams once wrote:
It is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
And boy! Im so glad that Mar didnt make it but then, I cannot help but ask:

If Robredo supporters are hell bent on replacing Duterte with Robredo, are they basically amenable to the idea that they will be putting back to power the Liberal Party, whose own members betray each other?

And lastly, a President Leni Robredo means she gets to appoint a new VP from the senate.

Are Robredo supporters amenable to a VP Hontiveros, de Lima, Trillanes, or, God Forbid, Drilon?

And how certain are Robredo supporters that her appointed vice president will not stab her in the back, similar to how Mar Roxas backstabbed Aquino with a hundred-million-peso knife?

Power should only be given to men who want it least.

Surely, that person is neither Roxas nor Robredo.",RJ Nieto,"February 17, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/02/nasaanangpangulo-mar-roxass-ambition-pr.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
SPO4 Pia Ranada's Rappler invited foreign owners to avoid bankruptcy?,"In January 2016, butthurt college sorority blogger Chay Hofilea, with help from fellow college sorority bloggers Paige Tinola and SPO4 Pia Raada-Robles, accused Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Sec. Martin Andanar of having political bloggers Sass Rogando Sasot and ThinkingPinoy (TP) on PCOOs payroll [Rap], essentially showing that Malacaang is doing something similar to the Office of the Vice-presidents (OVP) direct manipulation of Robredo-aligned netizens [TP: #LeniLeaks].

The investigative piece was based solely on one anonymous insider source, and Rappler took no effort in getting the side of the accused prior to the articles publication.

In response, I wrote a scathing rebuttal last week [TP: Hofileas Delusions]. In that article, I showed how Hofileas piece qualifies as a college sorority blog post at best.

With that said, let me, ThinkingPinoy, show Hofilea how a real investigative piece looks like.

Now, what should I write about?

I was thinking of an appropriate topic then I remembered that Hofilea, in her college sorority blog post, conveniently assumed that Malacaang funds dominant Duterte-aligned social media personalities Sasot and TP then argued that its unethical.

So why dont I talk about Rapplers finances?

Lets do that.


NOTE: This article was originally entitled ""SPO4 Pia Raada's Rappler violated constitution to avoid bankruptcy?"", but I updated the title recently to make it more relevant to current events.
Rapplers SEC Documents
Despite having launched in January 2012, Rappler Inc. started pre-operations in 2011, so I acquired its Audited Financial Statements (AFS) for the fiscal years ending in , , , , and .
DEFINITION: A Financial Statement (FS) is a summary report that shows how a firm has used the funds entrusted to it by its stockholders (shareholders) and lenders, and what is its current financial position. An Audited Financial Statement is an FS that has been audited by an independent accountant.
I have also acquired Rappler Inc.s [2016 General Information Sheet] (GIS).
DEFINITION: A General Information Sheet (GIS) provides information about a companys basic information, including SEC registration details,
Rappler Inc.s 2016 AFS still isnt available because it has yet to be filed.

Moreover, I also acquired Rappler Holdings Corporations [2016 GIS], along with its AFS for the years  and .

Rappler Holdings Corporation is Rappler Inc.s parent company.

The process of acquiring Rapplers docs wouldve been tedious, but I was lucky enough to get in touch with a few SEC people who hate Rapplers juvenile guts, so I got the documents in a jiffy.
For easy reference, here are links to Rapplers Documents:

Audited Financial Statement  2011

Rappler Holdings

General Information Sheet  2016
Audited Financial Statement  2015
Audited Financial Statement  2014


Lets start.

What is Rappler?
In its 2015 AFS, Rappler Inc said its primary purpose is to develop and sell news, information, social network services through various delivery formats, and that it is a subsidiary of Rappler Holdings. That is, Rappler Inc is the company that directly owns and controls the website Rappler.com, so its also the employer of college sorority bloggers Chay Hofilea, Paige Tinola, and SPO4 Pia Raada-Robles.
Now, a quick look at the Rapplers latest 2016 GIS shows that it used the Industry Classification Other Monetary Intermediation, despite describing itself as a news company.

According to The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Rev. 4 [UN, p. 216]:
6419 Other monetary intermediation
This class includes the receiving of deposits and/or close substitutes for deposits and extending of credit or lending funds. The granting of credit can take a variety of forms, such as loans, mortgages, credit cards etc.
What financial service does Rappler Inc provide, 5-6?


Now, a closer look at Rappler's 2016GIS Page 1-A shows that the nature of its business is ""Property Investment and Development""!

What the f*ck?

Rapplers chosen classification raised suspicion from my end because an appropriate industry classification is available to begin with, particularly [UN, p. 207]:
5813 Publishing of newspapers, journals and periodicals
This class includes publishing of newspapers, including advertising newspapers; publishing of periodicals and other journals, including publishing of radio and television schedules. Publishing can be done in print or electronic form, including on the Internet.
Or if Rappler will argue that it isnt a newspaper, then it can still use 5819 Other Publishing Activities.

But why did Rappler, despite having been pretending to be a news outfit since January 2012, still choose to be classified as Other Financial Intermediation?

Something sounds fishy, right?

I think the Securities and Exchange Commission needs to summon Rapplers accountants and its external auditor.

But what exactly is so scary about being legally considered as a news (i.e. mass media) company?

The answer lies in the constitution.

Constitutional Restrictions on Mass Media
Article XVI, Section 11 , of the 1987 Constitution states:
The ownership and management of mass media shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations, cooperatives or associations, wholly-owned and managed by such citizens.
The rationale? Foreign ownership of mass media companies allows foreign entities to influence the shaping of public opinion. Thats bad, especially if the foreign entity has more financial muscle than the Philippine Government itself. Yes, this is an issue of national sovereignty and national security.

Just imagine China or the US owning ABS-CBN or Inquirer. Wouldn't that freak you out?

Exactly.
Thats why the constitution requires mass media companies to be 100 percent Filipino-owned.

And that is what Rappler is not.

In May 2015, Rappler proudly announced that it received investments from Malaysia-based North Base Media (NBM), which traces its roots to billionaire George Soros [Rap]. More on that later.

Six months later, Rappler also proudly announced that it received investments from the US-based Omidyar Network (ON) [Rap], whose owner is known to have destabilized foreign governments. More on that later.


Yes, two of Rapplers investors are foreign entities, which gives rise to two questions: Is Rappler considered mass media? And If so, did Rappler violate the constitution by receiving foreign funding?

Is Rappler Mass Media?
Opinion No. 24 s. 1986 of the Department of Justice (DoJ) states [ChanRobles]:
The term mass media in the Constitution refers to any medium of communication, a newspaper, radio, motion pictures, television, designed to reach the masses and that tends to set standards, ideals and aims of the masses.
That is, internet-based news outfits, or at least those who declare themselves as one, are considered mass media.

Yes, Rappler Inc is a mass media company, so how does Rappler get away with getting foreign funding?

Both of Rapplers press releases cited in the previous section mention a certain financial instrument called Philippine Depositary Receipts.

In its 2013 Stock Market Outlook Report, RCBC Securities stated:
Philippine Depositary ReceiptIssued by a company facing foreign ownership restriction, such as a media company, in order to allow foreigners to invest tin the company. A PDR is an evidence of ownership of a foreign/foreign based entity in a Philippine corporation.
In short, PDRs allow foreigners to skirt foreign ownership restrictions. Obviously, PDRs, which Rappler uses, are tools to cheat the constitution. Anyone who disagrees should take a drug test.

Rapplers Creative Accounting
Rappler enjoyed its biggest capital infusion in 2015, where it received a whopping P170 million from the issuance of stocks per 2015 AFS.

In theory, and without the existence of PDRs, the new capital stock should have been issued to Omidyar and North Base, but of course, the law prohibits that.


Instead, the additional stocks were given to Rappler Inc.s parent company Rappler Holdings, who now owns 98.84% of the news outfit per Rappler Incs 2016 GIS.

This can only be possible if Rappler holdings issued P170 million in PDRs to Omidyar, North Base, and possibly, some other investor.

And here lies another problem:

Rappler Holdings gave Rappler Inc P170 million, but Rappler Holdings 2016 GIS shows that is just a company worth less than P12 million! Moreover, despite Rappler Holdings being the majority owner of Rappler Inc, it did not declare the latter as a subsidiary, in contravention with SEC regulations.

How could a P12 million company with a reported 2014 income of just 355 pesos (yes, just 355) and a 2015 reported income of just P13,188 have P170 million to give away?

It's as if P170 million came out of thin air!

It could only mean one thing: through financing activities, i.e. issuance of capital stocks or availment of loans. Rappler Holdings reported neither in 2015.

Magical! SEC Chair Teresita Herbosa, I think some people in Estancia need to do some explaining.

But were not done yet.

The Foreign Funders
Rappler funder Omidyar Network owner Pierre Omidyar co-funded Ukraine revolution groups with US government [Kyiv].

Thats one red flag, but theres more.

North Base Media and Omidyar Network have one common denominator: the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros.

In 2015, [TechinAsia] reported:
NBM is a fund for independent journalism founded by three prominent journalists: Marcus Brauchli; Sasa Vucinic, founder and former head of the Soros-backed Media Development Investment Fund; and Stuart Karle...
Meanwhile, Soros is one of Omidyar Networks venture partners in India [Omidyar].

And who is Soros? Heres a short description.

Soros is a Hungarian-American billionaire who made his money by betting massively against the British Pound in the 1990s, causing a massive currency crisis in the UK [Investopedia]. Hes also convicted of insider trading in the US [NYTimes].

Soros, a major Hillary Clinton donor, has also funded Media Matters, founded by David Brock, who operates on behalf of Clinton in several dubious capacitieslike running the Correct the Record SuperPAC, which hires Internet trolls to spread pro-Clinton ideologies on the Internet [Observer].


Alright, so two of Rapplers funders have strong links to destabilizers Perfect!

And you know what Rappler is doing to the current Philippine Government, of course.

But wait, theres more!

Rapplers Financials
ONs and NBMs respective decisions to invest in Rappler could have been defensible if Rappler was financially viable. That is, ON and NBM could have argued that Rappler is a legitimate financial investment, that Rappler is financially viable.

But that isnt the case.

Throughout its history, Rappler relied primarily on capital infusions to keep itself afloat. Based on its financial statements from 2011 to 2015, Rapplers has posted multi-million peso net losses year after year.
Based on Rappler's AFS from 2011 to 2015.
Rappler, in its five years of operations, was NEVER profitable. So why would two investment-savvy foreigners risk their money on a company that never made real money?

Is there a reason other than money?

But it gets worse: juxtaposing these Net Loss figures to their cash assets at the end of the year tells a grimmer story.

As we can see, the net loss of any given year has always been greater than the cash held at the start of the year. That is, it is imperative for Rapplers owners to RAISE CAPITAL EVERY YEAR in anticipation of the massive financial hemorrhages it chronically suffers. That is, acquiring new capital is the primary reason why Rappler still managed to stay afloat since its inception.
As you can see, Rappler continues to get capital infusions every year, despite the monumental losses it posts yearly. So why do people continue to fund in it? Do Rapplers investors care little about whether then can recuperate their investments?

Imagine that Rappler is your own sari-sari store. Your store loses more than it earns and you have to shell out money from your own call center salary to restock the store every day. Imagine youve been doing this since 2011. Now, how would you convince your friend to invest in your store when your friend knows its a money drain?

Well, Rapplers sari-sari store managed to do it.

Does Maria Ressa ask would-be investors, ""Open-minded ka ba?""?

This defies logic under normal circumstances, but the circumstances are anything but normal.

Rapplers funders are two government destabilizers. Now why did these financially savvy destabilizers give Rappler money? For profit? For financial returns?

I dont think so.

Rappler is dying, and funding from two foreigners with links to government destabilizers is what keeps it alive, so let me ask this:

College sorority blog Rappler's Chay Holifena and her delusions,"I have less than two hours to write this article. But it's just a rebuttal for a Rappler article, so two hours is all I need.

Rappler Rants
In Inside Martin Andanar's man cave"", butthurt college sorority blogger Chay Hofilena, with help from fellow college sorority bloggers Paige Occenola and Pia Ranada, brazenly accused PCOO Sec. Martin Andanar of using taxpayers' money to fund bloggers Sass Rogando Sasot and me, Thinking Pinoy.

Hofilena clearly attempted to disparage major social media players like Sasot and I for the benefit of journalists, whatever Rappler's definition of journalism is.

And Hofilena failed.

Miserably.

Let me address Hofilena's points one by one.

Hofilena's B.S.
Hofilena wrote:
Early on, after Duterte won as president, the first thing that Andanar asked the Malacaang Press Corps (MPC) officers was if bloggers like ""Thinking Pinoy"" could be accredited as members of the press corps. Clear about the distinction between the role of the press and that of pro-Duterte bloggers, the officers said no.
Chay, what exactly is the role of the press and what does it mean to be a pro-Duterte blogger? For you to be able to call me a pro-Duterte blogger, you must have read the 200-or-so articles I wrote in the past year.

Are you a closet ThinkingPinoy fan? I am seriously flattered.

To refresh your memory, I have castigated Duterte for his rape joke, scathingly criticized the PCOO, exposed the dirt involved in the the Senate Presidency power tussle between Senators Cayetano and Pimentel, humiliated Pimentel for his indecision, and even went as far as calling out the massively popular PNP Chief Bato dela Rosa for his ill-timed Las Vegas trip.

Does that make me a Duterte apologist? Supporting an administration is different from being an administration apologist. Using your logic, Rappler would be Robredo apologist.

And trust me, at this time, being a Duterte apologist is way, way better than being an apologist for Leni Robredo.

Moreover, who exactly is MPC to define the role of the press?

Which constitutional body accorded MPC that right?

Gandang-ganda sa sarili? Ganern? 
Social Media beats Mainstream
Darling, MPC membership is a privilege and not a right, and you might have forgotten that Malacanang has the final say on who gets into MPC and who does not, and Malacanang simply exercised prudence when they chose to adopt MPC's decision on the matter.

And I agreed with Malacanang, not because you said no, but because despite my exclusion from MPC, I have been kicking mainstream media's ass for the past year. Just imagine my delight when I learned how to use Facebook Page Insights and discovered that mainstream media has lost its monopoly on information.

Today, even without MPC membership, my engagement figures have exceeded Rappler's and Inquirer's figures COMBINED.
Actually, TP > CNN + Rappler + Inquirer, but I like CNN Philippines.

So please, stop trying to make it sound like I am itching to get into MPC.

MPC has lost credibility, the same reason why you got your panties in a bunch right now.

The tables have turned, Ms. Hofilena, social media has taken over the task of shaping public discourse.

Truth be told, it's the same reason why I was initially apprehensive to write a rebuttal, as I do not want to give you publicity.

Today, it's mainstream that needs publicity from social media, and not the other way around.

Stop deluding yourself.

Iayon ng arte sa ganda.
Taxpayers' Money
Hofilena wrote:
An apologist of the President and a public official who gets paid by taxpayers money, Andanar is embarking on a dangerous path of propaganda and media control... Palace insiders said that, starting September 2016, money was released to groups that had maintained an online presence in support of the President. The same insiders said some of these groups are identified with Andanar.
Again, here we go with Rappler's all-too-familiar anonymous source, a device that Rappler has all-too-often used to justify its rants.

You see, Miss Hofilena, a writer can use anonymous sources only if the writer possesses enough credibility in the eyes of the populace, something that everyone in Rappler sorely lacks.

And you're a Rapplerrette, just in case you forgot.

And you seriously believe that Rappler still has that credibility?

After Paterno Esmaquel publicly humiliated a Rappler reader, after Pia Ranada editorialized an article despite the requisite neuron count, after Ressa launched a four-part rant with nothing but anonymous sources?
Seriously, Hofilena, get a grip: your ego gets in the way of your logic. Face the reality that the public sees you as self-entitled, self-absorbed assholes.

Have you not learned about what happened to Pia Ranada not too long ago?

Darling, heto ang kape, at nang kabahan ka naman.

Bloggers like Sass and I have gone past the phase where we still need to gain legitimacy.

If Rappler, with its self-proclaimed supremacy in Social Media, just knew how to use analytics, it's easy to see that the public already sees us as more credible than you are.

Just look at the performance of your social media posts during the past several months.

There's one word that best describes it: nilalangaw.

Hofilena wrote:

This is exactly the problem. The article I wrote, if you just bothered to actually read it, shows that #LeniLeaks is mainly about the OVP propaganda email and not the ouster plot.

Which part of the title Inside Leni's Propaganda Machine did you fail to understand, or are you too stupid to even attempt to understand it?

And intimidate journalists?

If you feel so secure about yourselves, you wouldn't be intimidated by insignificant bloggers like me. Did I threaten you with anything illegal?

Such as a sissy.

All I said was that I will be reporting Pia Ranada's every move. Is accountability too much for the Fourth Estate?

Wow, Chay, mas manipis pa ang balat mo kaysa kay Michael Jackson!

MPC's Singapore shopping
Hofilena wrote:
He reported that only he and a handful of others were at a hotel lobby in Singapore waiting to ambush-interview officials. However, this is not how the media works and gathers news. Journalists do not base their stories solely on officialdom but countless other sources, depending on issues they are pursuing and monitoring. Ambush-interviews likewise do not yield the best of stories because officials tend to give answers on the fly.
This is the stupidest thing Hofilena said in the entire article.

Chay, tell me, who were the multiple sources that Pia Ranada was so busy interviewing that she wasn't able to spare even a minute in Shangri-La Singapore's Hotel Lobby?

Does Pia think those sources are more authoritative than cabinet secretaries themselves?


Who did Pia Ranada interview, the security guard in Lucky Plaza Mall? 

Tell me, what did Pia Ranada do in Singapore during the times when she wasn't attending a press conference? I yearn to know.

Honestly, there's a part of me that screams:
""Lintik ka Pia, sana iniwan ka na lang ni Duterte sa kanal noong campaign period.""
Boosts and Failure
Hofilena then went on to cite analytics data that  Lo and Behold!  are NOT independently veriable by third parties. Hofilena showed a graph showing Facebook interest on the #LeniLeaks issue, a graph that's customed-made by Rappler.

Kumbaga, ganda lang Rappler ang puhunan ng mga data na 'yon. 

Ang problema? Hindi naman kagandahan ang Rappler.

You still don't get it, Chay. Publishing unverifiable data requires credibility, something that Rappler lacks, something that you lack.

Hofilena then tried to attack the newsworthiness of #LeniLeaks by showing that the public is not interested in it. This raises two issues:

FIRST, newsworthiness isn't gauged by the number of people who read the article. Go back to journalism school Chay.

Is popularity the main criterion upon which Rappler decides which gets published and which does not? Is this the same reason why Ryan Macasaet, along with another Cebu-based correspondent, resigned from Rappler?

And if it is, e bakit nilalangaw pa rin ang mga posts niyo sa Facebook?

SECOND, you accuse Andanar of manipulating public discourse, yet you conveniently forgot the fact that #LeniLeaks is about the OVP manipulating public discourse.

So does that qualify you as a Liberal Party apologist?

And by the way, have you answered the question Who's Pete Silva?

Here you go lambasting Andanar for allegedly supporting bloggers like me, but you turn a blind eye on Your Lady of Naga for manipulating social media?

Tangina Chay, 'wag na tayong maglokohan dito. Nagmamaang-maangan kayo dito. Sige, pwede niyo ipilit na hindi ito newsworthy, pero wag kayong magtaka kung bakit sinasagasaan lang ng ThinkingPinoy ang Facebook performance niyo. 

Tapos, ang kapal pa ng mukha at kaliskis ni Maria Ressa na magbigay ng Social Media seminars, e ang tatanga niyo sa social media.

Chai further wrote:
For Andanar, whether in Malacaang or in his man cave, the distinction between journalists and bloggers, as well as news and propaganda, are all a blur.
Here we go again.

Ms. Hofilena, there is no distinction between journalists and bloggers, and in its absence, you're not the authority to define it.

Show me books that distinguish the two. There aren't any. 

Miss Hofilena, here's a NEWS FLASH: Rappler is NOT God's Gift to Journalism. Paige, Pia, and you, are NOT God's Gift to Journalism. Truth be told, you three are a disgrace to it.

Journalist's Ethics
And now that you have raised the issue of money exhanging hands, despite having no solid proof of it, can the public start calling your articles Fake News?

Rapplerettes claim to be journalists, but their ethics go directly against Journalists' Code.

FIRST, Rappler used a graphic showing Facebook stats without issuing the appropriate disclaimers, in total contravention with the Philippine Press Institute's (PPI) Journalist's Code of Ethics (JCE) which states:
In using scientific polls, the sample size and the margin of error should be disclosed. 
 In using non-scientific surveys, the manner in which they were taken and their limitations should be clearly explained in print. Merely labeling a survey as non-scientific is not sufficient. 
 Surveys that do not meet minimal scientific standards of validity and reliability should not be identified as polls, nor should they be portrayed in language suitable to scientific polls. 
 Great caution should be used in employing non-scientific polls to address substantial questions of public policy or to describe the popularity or approval rating of public officials or public actions.
Since you love citing anonymous sources, let me cite one of mine.
SECOND, Rappler, just like what it did in the anti-Duterte P. Guevarra article, chronically fails to get both sides of the story, in total contravention with the PPI JCE which states:
All efforts must be exerted to make stories fair, accurate and balanced. Getting the other side is a must, especially for the most sensitive and critical stories. The other side must run on the first take of the story and not any day later.
A Malacanang insider informed me that Pia Ranada requested for an accounting of PCOO's expenses in during the Singapore and Beijing State Visits which, unsurprisingly, are the two state visits that I covered. The insider said Ranada requested it last week and per FOI guidelines, it should take about three weeks for PCOO to comply.

Despite that, Ranada still failed to inform Hofilena that PCOO's reply is still pending, and even if she did inform Holifena, the latter  failed to mention that PCOO has yet to reply to their accusation.

Madaling-madali na ba kayo kasi palugi na nang palugi ang Rappler?

THIRD, Rappler gauges newsworthiness through popularity, and not through its effects on public interest, in contravention with the PPI JCE which states:
Public importance. The expected news story should be of such public interest that its news value clearly outweighs the damage to trust and credibility that might result from the use of deception.
Now, which part of Leni emails her supporters specific details on counter-propaganda does Hofilena fail to understand?

Ay! Wait, college sorority blog nga lang pala kayo. Sorry naman.
Funding Issues: TP vs Rappler
I am about to finish this writing this article and at I feel really terrible at this point.

Why? Because Hofilena's article is so crappy it doesn't even deserve a rebuttal. 

Syet, nagpa-manicure na lang sana ako.

Rappler calling me a paid hack is the worst thing Rappler can do to itself. I, ThinkingPinoy, have over 400,000 followers, followers who have helped sustain me financially, followers who donate their hard-earned money to help me cover as many events of public interest as I can. 

My almost-half-a-million readers will not be very happy.

And now that Hofilena has mentioned money, has she forgotten that Rappler is funded by foreigners, in violation of the Philippines' foreign ownership laws? Maybe it's time for a Senate Investigation on something that REALLY matters.

Chay, assuming without conceding that I am funded by taxpayers's money, are you saying that the Filipino public, 84 percent of which are satisfied with Duterte, will find a foreign-funded sorority more acceptable than a locally-funded blog?

I do not think so.

Now, will my followers accept Rappler's accusation that Malacanang sustains my blog instead of them?

I think not.

So Rappler, I suggest that you tell your Facebook moderators that they will have to work overtime.

They will have hundreds of thousands of people to ban.

And Chai, I have one last question for you:

Who is Pete Silva?

Tanga. Oo, tanga ka. Kasimpleng tanong, di mo masagot.

Rappler, you are a college sorority blog. Nothing more. Deal with it.

Let me challenge Rappler and MPC:
Let MPC's best representative debate with me on FB Live. and I'll make him eat his shit.
And no, I will not proofread this article anymore. It's not worth the time.",RJ Nieto,"January 26, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/01/college-sorority-blog-rapplers-chay.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#LeniLeaks: Mainstream Media's deception and how it'll backfire,"Two weeks ago, I published Inside Leni Robredo's international propaganda machinery. The article featured emails published in the Yahoo! Group Global Filipino Diaspora Council (GFDC), a civil society group led by billionaire lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis, her sister and former Commission on Filipinos Overseas chief Imelda Nicolas, and a several other extremely influential members of the Overseas Filipino community.


In that article, two basic things were shown:

First, that the Office of the Vice-president (OVP) actively controls its side of the ongoing propaganda war, as shown a forwarded email-directive supposedly sent by a certain Pete Silva.

Second, that the OVP is supported by a network of influential and wealthy individuals  including the powerful Nicolas Sisters  who disseminate, promote, and/or implement these email-directives.

The article quickly went viral in a few hours as it garnered hundreds of thousands of hits and tens of thousands of social media shares.

Yes, it became a full-blown scandal.

Reaction Times
Vice-president Leni Robredo's office reacted just like how it did during the #NasaanSiLeni (#WhereisLeni) scandal of the preceding week [TP: Pregnancy Doctor], where it took the office several days to issue a clarificatory statement.

Truth be told, I was not totally surprised by the glacial pace at which Robredo's PR Team works because one of my contacts in the Senate, who used to be aligned to Liberal Party (LP), explained to me that the standard operating procedure of many PR operators is to let the issue simmer for two to three days before issuing counter-statement.

The problem, however, is that social media doesn't sleep.

This SOP, while generally considered effective in the era of TV, radio, and print, doesn't work in the era of the internet, an era where people have access to content on demand.

What's worse, the OVP's silence was further accentuated by mainstream media's failure to pick up the story right away. For two full days, not a single mainstream outlet wrote anything about it. Whatever mainstream's reasons are, this deafening silence only managed to magnify the OVP incompetence, whether real or perceived.

Let me borrow the words of Robredo benefactor and billionaire lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis [Yahoo]:
(It) doesnt have to be true, (it) just needs to look like that.
But mainstream eventually picked it up, and how they treated the #LeniLeaks issue was nothing short of fascinating, and let me cite the most prominent ones.

Inquirer's Oscar Franklin Tan
In his column, the Philippine Daily Inquirer's Oscar Franklin Tan called the #LeniLeaks issue a bizarre nonstory, as he focused on the ouster plot angle of my original article [Inq]. Tan has a penchant for writing Inquirer articles with clickbait titles, but this one was particularly sneaky.

Specifically, Tan wasted no time citing Mocha Uson as a reference, despite the fact that it was my statements that he attempted to rebut. And how was I cited in his column? I was called one.
Why did he do that? Well, if he said Thinking Pinoy, his readers would have visited my website. They would have seen that the issue is not the ouster plot per se, but Leni Robredo's shady propaganda email.

Imagine this: if Tan mentioned Thinking Pinoy, his readers would have discovered that Leni Robredo told her followers to flip the memes and show unflattering pictures of BBM (Bongbong Marcos), that Robredo suggested that her followers use issues such as coccaine addict, fake diploma, and Sandro is stupid.

The problem: the OVP email was #LeniLeaks' central topic and NOT the ouster plot.

But of course, the ouster plot is easier to rebut, but the OVP email isn't, so why don't we just mention Mocha Uson and her alone?

I guess Tan can't find an alibi for Pete Silva's OVP email.

Rappler and Tony La Vina
College sorority blog and Liberal Party apologist [Rappler] also published a rebuttal, where it cited three loopholes in my original article, namely:

First, that theres a call for Dutertes resignation, but not a move for his ouster.

On the first point, Former Ateneo School of Government Dean Tony La Vina is right when said that calling for the Presidents resignation is a free political exercise. The problem, however, is that he conveniently forgot to mention that the ouster plot is NOT the central topic of my article. Instead, it's the OVP email from Pete Silva.

Second, that Robredo and Lewis deny meeting in the US over the holidays, with Robredo claiming that the last time they met was in the first half of 2016.

On the second point, Robredo's denial works only if she told the truth. But as De La Salle Professor Antonio Contreras pointed out, Robredo and Lewis met at an Overseas Filipino event held in August 2016, where Robredo was the keynote speaker while Lewis was a panelist [NYConsulate].

Yes, Robredo lies.

Third, that there is no connection between Pete Silva and the OVP so far.

On the third point, I would concede that a connection between Pete Silva has yet to be established. But for the sake of argument and in consideration of the damning contents of that email, isn't it incumbent upon the vice-president to  deny that the email came from her office and  at least offer to investigate this email?
Not long after #LeniLeaks erupted, Robredo cried foul over her disinvitation from Malacanang's Vin d'Honneur, saying that If they are mad at me, so be it. But they should have given my office a little respect [Inq]. Yes, Robredo wants her office to be respected, but she's fine with not denying the email and with Pete Silva using her office's name to propagate black propaganda?

And just like the Inquirer, Rappler conveniently forgot to cite the source of #LeniLeaks. That's just like telling their audience that something is wrong, without telling them exactly what that something is.

What is Rappler so afraid of? Surely, an unknown blogger is no match for Her Majesty Maria Ressa and her scales.

Anyway, let's go to the third and final article. I saved the best for last.

Businessworld's Greg Macabenta
I can smell the fear among mainstream media men, but I found one dissenter who was brave enough to mention Thinking Pinoy: Businessworld's Greg Macabenta [BW].

The problem? Macabenta is not very smart and, to say the least, hyper.

Macabenta's first twenty-or-so paragraphs were basically rants in the form of ad hominems, where he suggested that I was in the business of fear-mongering, so I skipped that part. After all, Macabenta already successfully made himself look like an idiot without my help.
Suffice it to say, the first half of the article was mostly pambalot sa tinapa. What's interesting, however, was everything that followed next.

Midway through the article, Macabenta acknowledged meeting with GFDC's members in Atty. Rodis' residence, something that my original blog post never mentioned. And his article went round and round this admission.


I do not know if Macabenta has been sniffing glue, but it appears that he was rebutting a Thinking Pinoy article that he never read.

Macabenta wrote, Neither David nor Pimentel was at the Rodis residence. But I was. And so was Loida Nicolas-Lewis. And so were many other prominent Filipino Americans...

Alright, so Loida's GFDC is alive and kicking, that's what I can deduce from this admission. But then, GFDC is not the focal point the original article, instead, it's Pete Silva's OVP email. But the ouster plot is easier to tackle, right?

Betrayal of public trust
Just like Inquirer's Tan, Macabenta chose to fixate on the ouster plot, not the fact that the OVP may have committed a grievous ethical breach by using government funds to undermine the government.

The discovery of the email-directive was solid. It's a solid story. It's just that these mainstream outlets hate citing social media blogs like mine because they are afraid of making us look more legitimate, and they're too proud to even paraphrase our discoveries.

Too bad we don't need mainstream media's validation anymore.

Pete Silva's email that was supposedly from the OVP and was forwarded by no less than CFO Chair Imelda Nicolas is the most important discovery in the #LeniLeaks emails. And did I mention that that email that also happen to have been published in pro-Leni pages Silent No More and Educators for Leni Robredo, on the same day that Nicolas received it?

Today is the 22nd of January, or almost two weeks since the #LeniLeaks controversy blew up. As of this article's writing, the OVP has neither denied the authenticity of the email nor offered to investigate the matter.


Did Tan, Rappler, and Macabenta  members of the mainstream media  find this detail so trivial, or are they just running out of excuses for Our Lady of Naga? Yes, mainstream media's half-assed treatment of the #LeniLeaks issue serves only to validate their personal political biases.

Too bad everybody knows about #LeniLeaks already. If there's one thing that I realized during this whole #LeniLeaks saga, it's that the Filipino People hardly need mainstream media anymore.

Public Trust on Mainstream media
The public doesn't trust mainstream media anymore, and social media is starting to take over.

As of January 2016, 74 percent of the 48 million Filipinos on Facebook are over 19 years old [WeAreSocial], that's about 35 million voters who get their first taste of the latest news on Facebook, and we expect more voters to join the platform as the internet penetrates an even larger part of the populace. The remaining 26%, who are aged 13 to 18, will reach voting age by 2022. That is, by the next presidential elections, around 48 million will be online.

What is my point?

More than just exposing the duplicity of Vice-president Leni Robredo, #LeniLeaks showed us that mainstream media has finally lost its monopoly in information. With social media, the regular Filipino can be directly informed about the latest developments in the national scene.

If Duterte's continually stellar satisfaction ratings [Sunstar] despite mainstream media's anti-Duterte barrage is to imply something, that would be the reality that most Filipinos have started to trust social media players more than their mainstream counterparts, as the strongest social media players right now  Mocha Uson, Sass Sasot, and ThinkingPinoy  are largely pro-Duterte.

The Future of Mainstream Media
Mainstream media, of course, will not necessarily die. But I am pretty damn sure that it will just become a shadow of its former self.

Mainstream media vs social media will be like Kodak vs digital photography.

In 2016, we were witness to one of the most aggressive mainstream media ad campaigns of the presidential candidates. Despite the billions that Roxas, Poe, and Binay spent on ads, it was Duterte  who spent the least  who won the polls [TP: SOCE].

Yes, it appears that pol ads have lost their once-mythical efficacy, and I expect that trend to continue in future, as more and more people ditch mainstream media for online platforms.

I think that by this point, most politicians have realized that expensive TV, radio, and print ads are not as effective as they were in the past, and I believe that in response, they will start recalibrating their campaign strategies in recognition of this development.

The 2022 election wars shall be fought online. Mainstream media companies, whose incomes rely heavily on political ads, are bound to suffer. That is, the news arms of mainstream media companies will most likely downsize in the not-too-distant future.

Ah, writing about mainstream media people losing their jobs will be fun! [TP]

"#LeniLeaks is about Leni, Our Lady of Naga","Sass Rogando Sasot's first post about a leaked OVP email, followed by my article, #OustDuterte: Inside Leni Robredo's international propaganda machinery, is what launched the #LeniLeaks scandal. Since then, the #LeniLeaks scandal has gotten so big, it took on a life of its own.

Administration officials have issued various warnings to various oppositionists. Oppositionists have issued various denials and alibis. And as for netizens... Ugh, where do I even start?

I think that after five days of nonstop bickering, it's time to put things back into perspective. Why? Because almost everybody is talking about the wrong issue, almost everybody is attacking a strawman.

Let's get started.


#LeniLeaks Origins
The #LeniLeaks issue started with Sass Rogando Sasot's discovery of a forwarded email published in the Global Filipino Diaspora Council (GFDC) Yahoo! group message board. In the GFDC board message, former Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) chair Imelda Mely Nicolas published an email from a certain Pete Silva,  an email that contained instructions from the OVP.

I am sorry to burst the bubble of conspiracy theorists, but the GFDC is NOT some clandestine organization, as it has been mentioned several times in news articles and press releases in the past. In 2014, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas described GFDC as the first global network of overseas Filipinos from 25 countries [CFO], and the said organization has been visible in mainstream news for a long time [Star, ABS].

Yes, GFDC is an established worldwide network of overseas Filipinos, a network led by several people who happen to wield a disproportionate amount of influence given their economic, social, and political backgrounds, several people who staunchly support the oppositionist Liberal Party, and who staunchly criticize the administration.

According to the leaked emails, the GDFC believes in the following assumptions:
that the Marcoses are evil
that Duterte is evil
that Leni is (or can be) an awesome leader
Now, let me clarify two things.

First, on Disproportionate Influence
I used the term disproportionate influence because GFDC's anti-Administration, pro-Leni, anti-Marcos leaders, who happen to be filthy rich or incredibly powerful or both (e.g. Loida Nicolas-Lewis), claim to be the voice of overseas Filipinos[MB] at large, even if they are not. For one, Duterte and losing VP candidate Marcos overwhelmingly won in the May 2016 Overseas Voting. Marcos, in fact, got almost twice as many votes as Robredo [Inq].

So who does GDFC represent? Apparently, GDFC's board's own interests.

And how many members does the GFDC board have? Sixty-two.

Ergo, disproportionate.

Second, on Criticism and Free Speech
Criticizing the administration is a perfectly legitimate exercise of free speech. My issue, however, is what GFDC leaders can do if their statements fall on deaf ears. You see, unlike the vast majority of Filipinos, GFDC leaders have the influence and finances to make things happen.

I think this is best described through an analogy: imagine you have a gossipmonger neighbor who's spreading a particularly disparaging rumor about you.

If you're a regular minimum-wage earner, the best you can do is to confront that gossipmonger and possibly give him a whack or two and that's it. You have neither the time nor the money to file a libel or slander case. But if you're rich and powerful...

You get the drift.

Why call it #LeniLeaks?
That is exactly the point why I TANGENTIALLY discussed the #OustDuterte issue. The problem, however, is that National Media  and even the government  decided to focus on the ouster issue at large instead of the central topic, which is a the VP undermining the government through a propaganda machinery that, at least partially, benefits from public funds.

Yes, the central issue is the existence of a well-oiled, well-funded, well-organized propaganda machinery, led by no less than the Office of the Vice-president.

And where did we discover its existence? The Leaked OVP email.

Hence, #Lenileaks.

And for those who don't read a lot, #LeniLeaks is a portmanteau of Leni Robredo, our alleged vice-president, and Wikileaks, a (in)famous whistleblower site.

And this issue is what the Office of the Vice-president continually evades, similar to how single women evade issues like unwanted pregnancies.

But how did the email imply the existence of a propaganda machinery?

Well, let's look at the email first.

The OVP Socmed Email
Pete Silva's email, as forwarded by Mely Nicolas and supposedly from the Office of the Vice-president's social media arm, contains a set of detailed instructions on how to do damage control in the aftermath of the #NasaanSiLeni controversy, i.e. the PR nightmare that followed VP Leni Robredo's decision to go on a US vacation despite having known that a super typhoon was about to hit her hometown.

To refresh your memory, the said OVP email reads:

--------- Forwarded message ---------
From: Facebook
Date: Wed, 4 Jan 2017 at 12:05 AM
Subject: New message from Pete Silva
To: Imelda Nicolas

Pete Silva
Pete Silva 11:35pm Jan 3
FROM OVP SOCMED:

Good morning!

Pro BBM/Duterte groups and influencers have launched simultaneous attacks on VP Leni starting 12 midnight today (Please check Maharlika, Sass, and Mr. Riyoh).

Here are some of the issues that need immediate response from our communities:

1. Late visit for the victims of Typhoon Nina + VP Lenis rehab is slow statement.
-The attacks from their camp:
A. Everything shes doing now is too late and just for a PR Spin.
B. VP Leni has no right to say the rehab is slow because she was not even there.
C. PRRD has visited way before she did.

-The Responses:
A. VP Leni has always been on top of things. The team was mobilized even before Typhoon Nina hit. She has organized and mobilized private efforts to donate for Bicol, Marinduque, Batangas, and Mindoro.
B. She does not have the mandate and financial capacity to do this, but she has made sure that efforts are consolidated and communicated the needs of the victims to the donors.
C. The dissatisfaction with VP Leni does not come from Bikolanos. It comes from troll influencers (Mocha, Sass, Thinking Pinoy) who NEVER organized or mobilized efforts to help out the typhoon victims.
C. VP Leni cannot shoulder everything. The national government (and other agencies eg DSWD) is the one who needs to step up.
D. Rehabilitation is different from relief operations. It needs building houses, electrification, and making sure that sources of livelihood pre-typhoon are working. We need to call out the national government on this, and take the offensive against their camp for having a simplistic view of the problem.
E. Compare the Duterte and the Robredo visit in Bicol. Digong just gave a speech for the ceremonial giving of donations. He did not go to the far flung areas to know their concerns. He never interacted with his constituents. He went there with the media only because he needs to be seen there. VP Leni, on the other hand, visited far flung areas and met with the people. She is on ground zero. 

2. The BBM Camp has released several memes to have a show of force. Their messaging is to make their memes viral to make it appear like more people voted for BBM as the real VP.

Our attack:
-Flip the memes and show unflattering pictures with controversies of BBM and use their the real VP narrative. (suggestions: Cocaine addict, fake diploma, did not graduate college, Sandro is stupid  not even from Oxford which they are claiming)
-Call out BBM and ask where he was during Typhoon Nina (he was in Balesin! ITO BA ANG REAL VP???).
-Use the photos of BBM supporters during the Luneta rally and/or Duterte youth during the Marcos burial rally. The messaging should be: theyre numerous online, but they never deliver the real bodies needed when the battle is offline. They are a fake and paid army.

We would also like to request you and your communities to coordinate with us whenever a new campaign is launched for them and/or against her. You are a very crucial ally in protecting the truth, democracy, and the real mandate of the people. Let us continue fighting the good fight.
--------- End of Message ---------
A post with identical content also exists on the Facebook page EDUCATORS FOR LENI ROBREDO [FB].

Now, what does this email mean?

Leni's Propaganda Machine
The leaked OVP email shows several things, including:
 The OVP itself actively instructs its supporters on how to deal with anti-Leni criticisms.
 The OVP is not above disparaging the national government and even private persons, just to save its own neck, in light of the statements, We need to call out the national government on this, and take the offensive against their camp for having a simplistic view of the problem. and Sandro is stupid.).
 The OVP uses alibis that are not backed by data, in light of the statement,  The dissatisfaction with VP Leni does not come from Bikolanos
 The OVP's use of irrelevant and pathetic alibis, such as setting the expectation that losing VP candidate Bongbong Marcos has some sort of legal responsibility to do the same things required from the OVP.
 The OVP has this notion their social media critics' supposed inability to set up relief efforts somehow puts OVP and its critics on equal footing.
The list goes on and on, and I think this can best be discussed in a follow-up article.

Regardless, I believe that it's clear at this point that #LeniLeaks primarily focuses on the suggestion that OVP possesses a well-organized, well-funded black propaganda machinery, something that the OVP has failed to deny so far.

But for a Propaganda Machinery to exist, two elements are necessary:
 A propaganda leader
 A vast network of loyalists to support and follow that leader
The existence of the first element  the propaganda leader  is already clear after the leaked email: it's the Office of the Vice-president. Even if there are other propaganda leaders, what's clear is that Vice-president Leni Robredo, who operates using public funds, is one of them.

The second element, however, remains to be shown, and that is where the rest of the Global Filipino Diaspora Council Yahoo! Group board messages come in.

As explained in a previous article, GFDC is a group whose members are highly influential, considerably wealthy, or both. I am not exactly sure if GFDC is the OVP's sole propaganda disseminator, but I am certain that it is one.

The anti-Duterte media blitzes of the past several weeks? GFDC has a hand in that.

The November 30 anti-burial rally? GFDC also has a hand in that.

And they even want to use the Marcos Burial Issue as a springboard for bigger anti-duterte demonstrations.

But what if GFDC doesn't get what they want? Will they just go home and cry, or will they use their vast resources to shift the tides?

And that is why I called upon the help of Malacanang to investigate this possible angle.

Again, an ouster plot is possible, but not certain, and that's why the National Security Council needs to look into it.

What's far more certain, however, is corruption in the Office of the Vice-president, as it appears to be using people on public payroll to manage an anti-government propaganda machine.
 
Authenticity and Admissions
Now, some would argue that the GFDC page could have been totally made up, but I have dealt with that issue in the follow-up article, #LeniLeaks: Sec. Raffy Alunan's Challenge and Mainstream Media's Reluctance.

Oh! And OVP Spokesperson Georgina Hernandez admitted the group's existence when she said, ""The so-called leaked information came from a public Yahoo group account which means that there is transparency in this information [Star].""
Yes, the lame-brained OVP spokesperson basically admitted that messages posted on the GFDC message boards were for public consumption, but that forces me to ask two questions:

FIRST: If GFDC Yahoo groups were supposed to be transparent, then why is the GFDC message board hidden now?

The #LeniLeaks scandal seem to have caught the OVP by surprise. OVP was so unprepared that it had no time to coordinate PR damage control messaging with its stakeholders.

SECOND: Does Hernandez' admission also mean that the OVP intended the Pete Silva email for public consumption?

I do not think so, as that would imply stupidity of intergalactic proportions on the VP's part. The OVP telling its followers to call Sandro Marcos bobo? That goes totally contrary to LP's attempt at turning Leni into Our Lady of Naga.

Epilogue
This bears repeating: #LeniLeaks focuses on corruption in the OVP, with a potential ouster plot on the side.

If a congressional investigation in aid of legislation is to be conducted, I recommend that it be about potential reforms in
laws governing public accountability of government officials, especially since I predict that VP Leni will disown the unethical actions of her social media employees, similar to how Mar Roxas and Noynoy Aquino threw command responsibility out of the window after the Mamasapano Debacle.

As for the ouster plot, I'll leave that to the National Security Council. Yes, a case of sedition against GFDC is weak, but the fact remains that the emails suggests a tendency of GFDC members, with all their money and influence, to go that route.

#LeniLeaks : Sec. Raffy Alunan's challenge and Mainstream Media's reluctance,"In yesterday's #OustDuterte: Inside Leni Robredo's international propaganda maachinery, Sass Rogando Sasot and I gave you a glimpse of how Vice-president Leni Robredo's well-oiled, well-funded, and hyper-influential PR machine works, thanks to billionaire Fil-Am lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis and the Global Filipino Diaspora Council (GFDC), of which Nicolas-Lewis is part.

The #LeniLeaks issue quickly gained traction as it trended on the number one spot on Twitter yesterday.


Refutations
Over the past year, I have established a reputation for writing well-researched articles with meticulous citations [TP: Aika Robredo]. Regardless, I still expected people to question the authenticity of sources cited, and that's perfectly reasonable.

After all, the key to the credibility of my articles is not the person who wrote it, but the quality and accessibility of my sources. Active citation links allow my readers to verify the facts by their own, allowing them to become part of the investigative process, allowing them to make value judgments of their own.

In the context of #LeniLeaks, it's clear that the question is whether the group indeed existed. This challenge is best encapsulated by a Facebook reaction from one of the commenters on former Interior Secretary Raffy Alunan's facebook posts.


UPDATE (3:37 PM 07 January 2017): I have been notified that this comment was written by a commenter on Alunan's post, not by Alunan himself and I apologize for the error. Regardless, the essence of this article remains the same. The article has been slightly modified to reflect this development.

The reaction reads:
Is this even VERIFIED or is this just being circulated as chismis? To be honest, I can type this up including the date and time stamps with just a shot of diligence and send to a newly-created yahoo group if I wanted to. The tone of composition is very fishy as well  same tone as many assumption and conspiracy theorists going around, not the tone of an insider.
I think it's fair critique, considering that the GFDC yahoo group administrator set the erstwhile publicly-accessible message board to private several hours after I published my article. That is, after setting the messages to private, the citations in yesterday's article that link to pages within GFDC's yahoo groups will be rendered useless.

Hence, the #LeniLeaks issue suddenly faced the possibility of dying a quick natural death.

TP's workaround
But not quite yet: those links can still be brought back to life.
Suffice it to say, I try my best to keep TP hyperlinks live for as long as reasonably possible. However, the problem with the article yesterday is the fact that GFDC's administrator intentionally hid their yahoo group message board, rendering some critical links useless.

However, there is a way to revive these links using a combination of two tools: Google Web Cache, and the online utility Archive.is.

Let me explain how this works.

Tool 1: Google Web Cache
Google Search is useful because it allows netizens to search for virtually anything in just a few seconds. This is made possible through Google's Cache.

Google has special programs called crawlers that scour the web for webpages, whether these pages are new, old, or modified. These crawlers take a snapshot of those pages and stores those snapshots to Google's Cache.This way, Google will just have to search its Cache whenever a netizen enters a search term, enabling Google to return results much faster than it would if it manually search the entire World Wide Web each time [GoogleGuide].
To cut the long story short, Google still has cached copies of many of the pages in GFDC's yahoo group. That is, we can look for Google's snapshots and use those snapshots as a substitute target page for the dead TP links.

There are many ways to access cached pages, but I chose the most convenient, cachedview.com, which allows me to access cached copies of any given URL, if available.

Tool 2: Archive.is
Cached pages, however, are temporary pages. Google regularly updates it caches every now and then. That is, a page's snapshot may be gone after some time. Thus, it's important to freeze a snapshot so that it can still be viewed even after Google updates or flushes it cache.

To do this, I used Archive.is, a website that stores snapshots of web pages. This way, we can freeze the snapshot and make it accessible far longer than it would.

The alternative to this 2-tool process is saving the pages on my own PC, but that may cause some sort of chain of custody issue because files saved on a PC can be tampered, roughly similar to how the Smartmatic modified the source code during the May 2016 elections [TP: BBM vs Leni].

With the Google Web Cache (CachedView) and Archive.is combo, however, we can be assured that contents of the page have not been tampered with, as the process is entirely automated. Moreover, both utilities are owned by third parties who are disinterested in the #LeniLeaks issue.

I think the best way to explain the process is through an example, and let's use the one of Nicolas-Lewis' GFDC messages with URL https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/globalfildiaspora/conversations/messages/5904, which is basically a dead link because of access restrictions. 
How to archive a page snapshot
Now, suppose I deleted that article for whatever reason, but some guy from somewhere wants to know what's in it. This is what we do:
First, go to cachedview.com, enter the desired URL, then click Google Web Cache. The site will then send you to the cached copy, or snapshot, of that URL.

Second, go to the browser's address bar and copy the cached page's address, which is usually in the form of https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:URL

Third, go to Archive.is, enter the newly-acquired cached page URL in the red field, then click save the page
Wait for the process to finish, and you will be sent to the archived version of the cached page, and the URL of that archive will be used a subsitute for the dead URL.

Hence, for the Loida example...
Original Article: https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/globalfildiaspora/conversations/messages/5904
Cached Copy: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/globalfildiaspora/conversations/messages/5904
Archived Cache: https://archive.fo/5YCVS
Now, we can use the Archived Copy as a substitute target page in case the original article is no longer available. And that's what I did to all the dead links in yesterday's article, since all the links leading to GFDC pages lead to a dead end. That is, all the dead links in yesterday's article are now back to life.

Fabricated Evidence? Writing Style?
Now that we have settled potential chain of custody issues arising from using substitute sources, I think it's time to answer the other part of Sec. Alunan's question, which is:
To be honest, I can type this up including the date and time stamps with just a shot of diligence and send to a newly-created yahoo group if I wanted to.
This will be true only if I have access to both Yahoo's and Google's servers, a feat that even Loida Nicolas-Lewis' camp, with all her power and wealth, cannot achieve.

Take, for example, the email containing instructions allegedly from the Office of the Vice-president [GFDC]. A screen capture of the top part of the archived copy is shown below:


This part shows where the snapshot came from, i.e. from Google's cache of the GFDC post, along with date and time at which Google's crawlers took a snapshot of that page.

Hence, the issue on whether Google's crawlers got it from the actual yahoo group is settled. The question now is whether this post is planted evidence or not.

To address that, a screen capture of the bottom part of the archived copy is shown below:


As you can see, the post has web elements that are impossible to modify without hacking skills that are good enough to fool Yahoo's own servers. The time stamp of Jan 4 6:55 AM, in particular, is not something that is easily modified.

If the reader knows how to bypass Yahoo's security, I sincerely plead that she teach me how.

Aside from that, the reality is that Leni virtually had no critics before the 2016 elections

If the GFDC Yahoo Group was indeed fabricated, how would that explain the existence of posts from , , ?

Moreover, it's interesting to note that this OVP Socmed message is corroborated by an identical message posted on Pro-Leni facebook group Educators for Leni Robredo about 11 hours after the 6:55 AM email [FB].

Now, dear reader, I understand your qualms about my writing style.

But substance over form. Substance over form. Do not make the same mistake as that committed by the #Disente crowd.

Epilogue
I am still giving mainstream media the benefit of the doubt on the issue of its reluctance to cover the #LeniLeaks issue, owing to the dead links yesterday.

But now that the links are live again, let's see if mainstream media men will finally have the balls to standup against their elite overlords.

What do you think, Maria Ressa?",RJ Nieto,"January 7, 2017",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2017/01/lenileaks-sec-raffy-alunans-challenge.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Inside Leni Robredo's international propaganda machinery,"Oh, Georgina! I pity you.
NOTE: GFDC has fixed their settings several hours after this article's publication. As a workaround, I looked for that webpage in Google's Cache and saved a permanent snapshot on third party utility Archive.is. 
I did the same for all the GFDC webpages cited within this article. This way, copies of those pages will be out of the Liberal Party's reach.
Last night, my friend Sass Sasot informed me about the existence of a restricted Yahoo group called Global Filipino Diaspora Council (GFDC) [Yahoo].

The more prominent GFDC members include:
Billionaire Fil-Am lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis  
Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) Chairman Imelda Mely Nicolas, Loidas sister  
CFO Commissioner Jose Molano, Jr.
Inquirer US Bureau columnist Ted Laguatan  
ABS-CBN Europe News Bureau correspondent Atty. Gene Alcantara  
Northern Europe civil society leader Filomenita Mongaya Hgsholm 
Judging from this list of very influential people, I now have a better idea why international media acts a certain way against President Duterte. Just look at the list: a billionaire financier, two bureaucrats who have access to overseas grassroots organizations, an Inquirer journalist, an ABS-CBN journalist, and a civil society leader.
Now, the chronically negative Western coverage of the Duterte Administration, along with the two Media Blitzes [TP: Mainstream; Plan 0117], suddenly make so much sense now.

For example, we all know that the 30 November 2016 anti-Marcos rally had relatively negligible attendance. A real people power requires over 200,000 people, and attendance on that day did not exceed 15,000, probably much less.

Despite the failure of the anti-burial rally, it was still reported throughout the world, and I think one of the message threads explain why.

Let's look at the 28 November 2016 [GDFC] message thread entitled 5878Re: [globalfildiaspora] dan and jojo, noted and all these groups have copies of this exchange of emails among us and them. thanks Mely Re: To Susan/other egroups, here are the email addresses of those in the US that people can contact re rallies Fwd: These are some suggested PLACARDS for the Nov 30 rally.

Part of that thread contains the following message:
On Mon, Nov 28, 2016 at 12:19 PM, Dan Songco wrote: 
Mely, can you request the groups abroad if they can photo document their rallies and send them to you so we release them to local media? Thanks.
Who is Mely? It's CFO Chairmain Imelda Nicolas.

Another section of the same thread provides us some insight into the size of GFDC's network, as it has people in San Francisco, New York, Chicago. Add that to GDFC's reach in Mainland EU via Sweden's Filomenita Mongaya Hgsholm and Italy's Rowena Sabugo; and the UK via Gene Alcantara and Loline Reed.



Yes, if there is a well-organized, well-funded, highly-influential propaganda machinery, this is it.

But wait, there's more!
Robredo's OVP Socmed pulls the strings 
While set as Restricted, the group administrator seemingly forgot to make conversations private, and that is how Sass stumbled upon the group's publicly viewable message board, where CFO chairman Imelda Nicolas happens to be the most active contributor. 

I am pretty certain that no one in GFDC intended the messages to be publicly available, especially since several of these messages are damning not only for their group, but also to embattled Vice-president Leni Robredo [TP: Thief] and the Liberal Party of the Philippines.
Take, for example, the message Imelda Nicolas posted on 04 January 2017 at 06:55 AM entitled 5915 From the Social Media Group of OVP [GFDC], which reads:

Subject: New message from Pete Silva

To: Imelda Nicolas


Pete Silva

Pete Silva 11:35pm Jan 3

FROM OVP SOCMED:

Good morning!

Pro BBM/Duterte groups and influencers have launched simultaneous attacks on VP Leni starting 12 midnight today (Please check Maharlika, Sass, and Mr. Riyoh).

Here are some of the issues that need immediate response from our communities:

1. Late visit for the victims of Typhoon Nina + VP Lenis rehab is slow statement.

-The attacks from their camp:

A. Everything shes doing now is too late and just for a PR Spin.

B. VP Leni has no right to say the rehab is slow because she was not even there.

C. PRRD has visited way before she did.

-The Responses:

A. VP Leni has always been on top of things. The team was mobilized even before Typhoon Nina hit. She has organized and mobilized private efforts to donate for Bicol, Marinduque, Batangas, and Mindoro.

B. She does not have the mandate and financial capacity to do this, but she has made sure that efforts are consolidated and communicated the needs of the victims to the donors.

C. The dissatisfaction with VP Leni does not come from Bikolanos. It comes from troll influencers (Mocha, Sass, Thinking Pinoy) who NEVER organized or mobilized efforts to help out the typhoon victims.

C. VP Leni cannot shoulder everything. The national government (and other agencies eg DSWD) is the one who needs to step up.

D. Rehabilitation is different from relief operations. It needs building houses, electrification, and making sure that sources of livelihood pre-typhoon are working. We need to call out the national government on this, and take the offensive against their camp for having a simplistic view of the problem.

E. Compare the Duterte and the Robredo visit in Bicol. Digong just gave a speech for the ceremonial giving of donations. He did not go to the far flung areas to know their concerns. He never interacted with his constituents. He went there with the media only because he needs to be seen there. VP Leni, on the other hand, visited far flung areas and met with the people. She is on ground zero.

2. The BBM Camp has released several memes to have a show of force. Their messaging is to make their memes viral to make it appear like more people voted for BBM as the real VP.

Our attack:

-Flip the memes and show unflattering pictures with controversies of BBM and use their the real VP narrative. (suggestions: Cocaine addict, fake diploma, did not graduate college, Sandro is stupid  not even from Oxford which they are claiming)

-Call out BBM and ask where he was during Typhoon Nina (he was in Balesin! ITO BA ANG REAL VP???).

-Use the photos of BBM supporters during the Luneta rally and/or Duterte youth during the Marcos burial rally. The messaging should be: theyre numerous online, but they never deliver the real bodies needed when the battle is offline. They are a fake and paid army. 

We would also like to request you and your communities to coordinate with us whenever a new campaign is launched for them and/or against her. You are a very crucial ally in protecting the truth, democracy, and the real mandate of the people. Let us continue fighting the good fight.
--------- End of Message ---------


The Email's Implications
Okay, I am not a BBM supporter, but it's stupid to blame BBM for being in Balesin when the fact of the matter is that unlike VP Robredo, HE IS NOT A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL RIGHT NOW.

But I digress.

Chairman Nicolas' email containing Pete Silva's Facebook message has several mind-boggling implications:
FIRST, that the Office of the Vice-president (OVP) actively manipulates its supporters. Here, we see that no less than the Office of the Vice-president is instructing Robredo's supporters how they would act on social media, even going as far as instructing Leni supporters to denigrate the president just to prop up the VP's problematic image.

SECOND, that the Office of the Vice-president's propaganda machine is supported by GFDC, a small group of people who wield great international influence and, by virtue of Loida's inclusion, wealth.

I can vividly remember the time when Rappler's Maria Ressa accused Duterte-aligned pages of being a part of some well-oiled PR machinery [TP: Ressa's Pride], when it appears that it actually is the other side that actually has the means to have such a thing.

THIRD, that the publicly-funded OVP is using government resources to undermine the government. Who pays for the salary of that OVP personnel who sent that message to Pete Silva.
Is it lawful to use government funds for the purpose of undermining the government? This, my friends, is a betrayal of public trust, if not a culpable violation of the Constitution. I have forwarded this email to a few high-profile lawyer-friends for examination.

Off the top of my head, however, I believe that this email may constitute Inciting to Sedition [RPC Art. 142], if not Sedition itself [RPC Art. 139], and/or a violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act [RA 3019 Sec. 3(e)].
While the Vice-president's immunity from suit is still contended, the OVP's social media personnel, which may include OVP Spokesperson Georgina Hernandez, may still be sued in a court of law. This also includes Pete Silva, and GFDC members who participated in disseminating the OVP's controversial email.

It's more than just THAT email
A deeper look at the message board showed what GFDC's Sister Act, Loida Nicolas-Lewis and Imelda Nicolas, have been doing the past several months.

Aside from lobbying in the United Nations against the appointment of Philippine Ambassador to the UN Teddy Boy Locsin [GFDC], Loida Nicolas-Lewis has been active in organizing protest actions calling for President Duterte's resignation.

Part of an Nicolas-Lewis' email dated 04 December 2016 states:
The only way to fight this evil Plot to unseat VP Leni is to ask Duterte to Resign.  
After all, he promised to resign in six months if he has not solved the drug epidemic in the Philippines.

He asked for an extension of another six months.

Extension Denied!!!

Join ""Duterte Resign Movement""
A cursory look at the email gives me the impression that while absurd, it is still within legal bounds to issue such a statement. A closer look, however, suggests otherwise.

It's clear that Nicolas-Lewis believes that VP Robredo will certainly be unseated if Duterte does not resign, but Nicolas-Lewis is no innocent college activist who would hope against all hopes that the old man will vacate Malacanang.

Now, what would you do you're certain that your bet Leni will lose her position, Duterte refuses to resign (ergo stays in power), and you have $600 million at your disposal?

Yes, that's one of the reasons why Malacanang accused Nicolas-Lewis of hatching an ouster plot. Malacanang appears to be so certain about its existence that it sent trusted Cabinet Sec. Jess Dureza to the US to meet no less than Nicolas-Lewis herself [GMA].

Duterte refuses to resign 
I think it's clear by now that Duterte will not resign in the foreseeable future.

In response to those who are supposedly planning to oust him, Duterte said in December [CNNPH]:
I'll give you a good fight, I'll give you a bloody nose.
Loida is a billionaire lawyer-businesswoman. She is not stupid. Her initial attempt at calling for Duterte's resignation must have been made for acoustic effect and little else, as it appears that she is actively supporting Leni's election-related cases.

Here is part of an email from Nicolas-Lewis dated 4 December 2016 [GFDC; Scribd]:

Ely, pls call Lilly my exec asst 212-756-8958 and ask her to connect you to me.

God's blessings,

Loida

>Show message history

Loida,

How do we go about supporting Leni's Legal Defense ?

Ely N.
The phone number mentioned in the email is registered under the Reginald Lewis Foundation, named after Loida's late husband [RLF].

Now, Loida is a billionaire, so what else would Leni need from Loida but... ?

And isn't it interesting that Leni Robredo visited New York City just last week, in absolute defiance to common sense [TP: White Christmas]?

Did Leni and Loida talk about something very important, so important that Leni totally forgot about those in the laylayan?

These discoveries fit perfectly to my article #OustDuterte: Leila, Leni, Lourdes, Loida, LP and Plan 0117.

Yes, LP is likely to have its last hurrah soon. Very soon.

Ressa, you have been looking at the wrong place... or was it deliberate?

FACT CHECK: Mocha Uson received P300K from BBM?,"Just when I thought I was done for the day with my newest article Mainstream Media's love affair with Leni Robredo, I was surprised to discover that various pages have been spreading an image that shows a cheque for Php 300,000, allegedly addressed to Mocha Uson and signed by no less than former Senator Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos.

The photo has been shared by Liberal Party-aligned pages with Oras Na Roxas Na leading the pack.

My initial reaction was shock, not for the allegation that Mocha received bribes from BBM, but for the fact its hard to believe that Mocha Uson could be bought for so little.

Pero sige, patulan natin.


The allegation
A screenshot of the cheque is show below.
As we can see, the image shows the cheque amounting to Php 300,000, dated 27 December 2016, addressed to a certain Margaux Uson, and bears a signaure similar to the signature found on a 2005 holiday card sent by former Sen. Marcos.

All other identifying marks in the check have been redacted, presumably the Silent No More, the original poster.
The image lacks information on the following:
Accountholders Name
Account Number
Check Number
Initial Observations
The name, account number, and check number have been redacted, and I found that absurd. The check, if authentic, would be a direct violation of bank secrecy laws. If it were fake, then it would be a violation of existing libel and forgery laws.

Regardless of its authenticity, Silent No Mores administrator has already committed a crime just by publishing the check, so why bother shading those three areas?

Or maybe because its harder to photoshop those parts?
For one, I could easily rip off a check from somebody else check book, blot the identifying arks, then forge the payee name, amount, and signature, then claim whatever.

But that kind of reasoning is not sufficient to completely debunk Silent No Mores libelous claim, so heres one more thing.

2016 PCHC Guidelines
All cheques have to go through the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC) for them to be completely processed. That is, cheques can be encashed only if they were prepared in accordance with PCHC guidelines.

As we can see from the image above, the payee name written on the cheque Margaux Uson, despite Mocha having a pair of first names, i.e. Margaux is not Mochas complete first name.

Note that the check is dated 27 December 2016.

So whats the problem?
Well, PCHC has been rejecting cheques with incomplete information since January 2016. Let me quote part of existing PCHC guidelines [PCHC]:
starting January 4, 2016 checks with INCOMPLETE INFORMATION will no longer be accepted for clearing When writing a check, necessary information should include the following: 
a. Date of the Check
b. Name of Payee
c. Amount Payable in Figures
d. Amount Payable in Words
e. Signature of the Drawer
Yes, the payee's name, as seen on the cheque, is incomplete, so per PCHC guidelines, theres virtually no way that check could have been encashed, as it was dated AFTER January 2016.

Nice try, Oras Na Roxas Na, but your administrators lack the requisite neuron count to pull this kind of sh!t off.


UPDATE 06 JAN 2016 1130 AM:
From a BPI Branch Manager:
INCOMPLETE INFORMATION  This means that for a cheque to be processed by PCHC, all information necessary should be indicated. Your claim that the cheque is incomplete because ""Margaux Uson"" is not Mocha's complete name, I believe is incorrect.
1. PCHC only processes the clearing of the cheque. PCHC only handles cheques deposited to another bank different from that of drawer. Example: i deposited a BDO cheque issued to me to my BPI account.
2. It is not PCHC's responsibility to check whether the payee's name is different from the depositor's name. Example: Payee's Name: Margaux Uson, Depositor's Name: Thinking Pinoy. They do not have access to the details of the depositor.
3. That responsibility lies to the depositor's bank. Example, I am a bank manager of a BPI branch, our job is to make sure that the payee is the same person as the depositor. We have this ""Know your Client"" Policy. So if I believe that Margaux Uson is the same person as Margaux Joy Uson for instance, I can allow the deposit especially if it is within my approval limit.
But the thing with this cheque is that it doesn't have any sign that it has gone through PCHC Clearing, or same bank clearing. It doesn't also have any sign that it has been encashed.

In short, it hasnt been processed yet. Meaning, you're correct that anybody can get any cheque then claim anything most especially if the cheque details are redacted.

Mainstream Media's love affair with Leni Robredo,"Vice-president Leni Robredos extremely conspicuous absence during and immediately after Typhoon Ninas onslaught, along with mainstreams medias treatment of the issue, has led me to a series of realizations that go way beyond the usual disgust for Lenis hypocrisy.


#NasaanSiLeni: The Background
Despite having knowing full well that a super typhoon was about to pummel her own hometown, Vice-president Leni Robredo still proceeded to fly to the United States, purportedly to attend a family reunion that was, in the words of her own spokesperson, planned over a year ago [TP: Thief in the Night].

The typhoon made landfall in the Bicol Region on the day Leni arrived in Newark Liberty International Airport. From that point forward, all we heard from the VP were through tweets, official written statements, Facebook posts, and announcements from her spokesperson Georgina Hernandez, i.e. messages that could have easily been written not by her, but by her support staff.

From the time Typhoon Nina struck Naga on Christmas Day up to Media Noche, VP Leni was nowhere to be found. Despite the proliferation of cheap communication technologies like Facebook Live, Viber, Whatsapp VoIP, and Snapchat, she failed to spend even ten seconds to send a personal message of consolation for the hundreds of thousands of people that Nina terrorized.

Yes, she wasnt even able to spare a few seconds out of the three minutes she spends waiting for her poop to drop into the toilet bowl.

She was THAT preoccupied. But with what?

Your guess is as good as mine, but I am not the kind whos fond with mindless speculation, so I tapped onto my network of contacts.

I found out that she had dinner with a geriatric pregnancy doctor the night before she left for Manila, at the risk of missing her long-overdue flight [TP: Pregnancy Doc].

She found at least an hour to spend with this doctor despite her inability to spend even ten seconds to record a personal message for Bicolano Typhoon victims.

Whats even more confusing? The Robredo camp claimed the VP was attending a family reunion, but it appears that Lenis siblings  the Geronas  were mostly in Canada during this period.

Now, if that doesnt raise more than a few eyebrows, I dont know what else will.

Leni Arrives in Manila
From December 25 to January 1st, mainstream media was largely mum about this issue, with the only news bit being the VP spokespersons statement that Robredo went to the US for a family reunion that was planned over a year ago.

Yes, thats basically it for mainstream, despite mainstreams vast resources, despite them having news bureaus in the United States.

Yes, there was deafening near-total silence on the issue, and its extremely disturbing.>
Leni arrived in Manila in the morning of January 2nd via a Cathay Pacific flight from New York City, with short a layover in Hong Kong. I have announced her arrival several hours in advance, and my over 300,000 followers (plus Mainstream Media people who follow my blog) knew Leni was arriving in a few hours.

Despite this, not a single mainstream media outlet was waiting at the airport to ambush-interview the vice-president. Not a single mainstream media outlet felt that the people deserve an explanation for the vice-presidents negligence. Yes, its as if everything is A-OK.

Leni, despite her propensity for calling too many press conferences, did not immediately call for on upon her arrival. Hours passed and she said nothing, only to suddenly appear in NIA road where a massive fire occurred days before her arrival, apparently to show that Leni still cares.

Too bad she was caught laughing while inspecting the site.

Lenis Press Conference
In a press conference held a day after her Manila arrival, VP Robredo said [ABS]:
""Andun ako (sa US) na ang sama sa loob na may nangyayari dito na wala ako...masama yung timing ngayon. Masama yung loob ko na nangyari yun na wala ako,"" she said, as she met with victims of the typhoon in Naga City.
TRANSLATION: I felt really bad while I was there and something was happening here. The timing was bad. I feel bad that I was not there (in Bicol) when it (Typhoon Nina) happened.

Robredo also said she found it hard to book return tickets as December was peak season.

Robredo added:
""Napakahirap maghanap ng limang tickets kasi kasama ko yung tatlo kong anak at nanay ko na 80 years old.""
TRANSLATION: It was hard to look for and book five tickets. I was with my three daughters and my 80-year-old grandmother.

I think I now have a better idea as to why Leni went on radio silence the entire time she was in the States.

The reason? Shes too stupid for her own good.

First, there is no such thing as a well-timed natural disaster. Did Leni seriously expect Nina to RSVP before it hits the country?

Second, she knew at least a day in advance that Nina is arriving, yet she still left. This clearly shows where her priorities lie. Bayan muna bago sarili (Country before self)? Leni knows nothing of that sort.

Third, two of Lenis children are already adults. Its not like they will be helpless if Leni goes back to the Philippines and leaves them behind for the lack of available flights. Bicol needed a vice-president, not the vice-president entire family.

Despite Lenis lame excuses, mainstream media still appears to be so convinced that Our Lady of Naga is still the best vice-president this country has ever had.

Yes, despite the fact that it shameslessly defies common sense.

Another Anti-Duterte media blitz
Criticism against Leni were confined in social media, as mainstream mass media chose to see no evil and hear no evil.

LP must be hemorrhaging millions in exhange for that deafening silence.


A day before Robredo flew to Manila, we were again witness to another anti-Duterte media blitz using the discredited witness Edgar Matobato, with CNNs Will Ripley leading the pack, with Ripley even going as far as using the words Killer with a conscience to describe Matobato. Then followed the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the Croatian Telegram, the Swedish Dagens Nyheter, the Philippine Canadian Inquirer, among others.

Is this media blitz an attempt to divert public attention from Robredos faux pas?

Your guess, again, is just as good as mine.

Regardless, one thing is clear: if one really wants to learn whats going on, the last place to learn it would be mainstream media.

Now, I wouldve have joined the Filipino public in its righteous indignation over mainstreams betrayal of public trust, but I am not the kind of person who unnecessarily gets mad.

I do not get mad: I get even.

A rock to bash ones own head with
I think that by now, its already clear that each time Malacanang invites mainstream media to its doorsteps is another opportunity for mainstream media to f*ck them over.

Not too long ago, I wrote an open letter addressed to President Duterte, with a tacit CC to Presidential Assistant Christopher Bong Go:

Dear Daddy D,

Good evening Mr. President.

I heard the news that you invited five news outlets so they can each conduct an hour-long 1-on-1 interview with you. Interestingly, all these come from the mainstream, and social media does not even have one representative.

You see, Daddy D, I understand that you come from a different time so you may not have the most comprehensive understanding of social media, but I want to respectfully let you know that mainstream is dying, and that you may inadvertently be neglecting the same platform that helped you win last May.

Honestly, we are the ones who actually help prop up your image despite the nonstop barrage from mainstream media.

Why do you still score high on satisfaction surveys? Among other reasons, it's because we help counter the unwarranted shit thrown at you.

I do not harbor ill feelings about your choices in this matter, but Iet me say, with all due respect, that you basically chose the five organizations that are more likely to fuck you over for the nth time.

Social Media is what galvanizes public support for you. Social media is what will help gather the warm bodies who will defend you if and when an ouster attempt materializes.

You know that. We know that. And that's why I wrote this short letter.

There's no point in beating a dead horse, Daddy D.

Please listen to those who listen to you.

Lovingly yours,
TP
And my claims here cannot be truer in light of whats happening today.

What exactly am I trying to say?
I urge Malacanang to stop treating social media entities like second class citizens. Yes, I heard that they are planning to grant social media access to Malacanang, but that access is nowhere near what mainstream media historically enjoys.

Mr. President, help those who help you.

Just look at my case.

I have been writing as TP since 2015, and despite the painstaking citations in each of my blog posts, I still am struggling to gain legitimacy in the eyes of public, thanks to mainstream players who feel threatened by the fact that scantily-funded political blogs like mine gain much more traction than their social media arms.

I have funded ThinkingPinoy through personal savings, Google Adsense revenues, and voluntary reader donations. That isnt a lot of money, but I have to make do with it because thats the reality.

I mean, just look at my situation right now: I have received a couple of death threats for publishing my latest article so I am currently hiding in a foreign country to shield myself from potential assassination attempts.

To make matters worse, I have dealt with death threats in as early as April 2016, when I exposed Sen. Trillanes hacker connections.

I have been dealing with death threats since then, and I have trained my brain to think of them as a fact of life. Despite all these, I still write with passion, with every fiber of my being, because I believe that the future of the Filipino is more important than my own.

And I receive nothing in return, except the hope that in the event of my death, I will be seen as a hero by a few.


You are what the people want. And I want to give the people exactly that.

So why, Mr. President, are you making it hard for us to help you?

Why, Mr. Go, why?


What can you do?
But enough of my ranting. Lets talk about you, the regular Filipino.

Powerlessness is one of the worst feelings anyone can have and you, the regular Filipino citizen, should be very familiar with it, especially after your collective interests have been chronically subverted by mainstream media for the past year.

But you are mistaken: you are not powerless.

Voice your thoughts on social media. You may lose friends in the process, but you will be able to sleep more soundly at night, with the knowledge that you did your part in making the Philippines a better place for your children and your childrens children.

Be not afraid. Make your presence felt.

Gone are the days when a single voice means nothing. Today, anybody can be the next Mocha Uson, the next Sass Rogando Sasot, or the next ThinkingPinoy.

Trust me, no matter how small your voice is, if it screams in unison with the rest of the masses, then no mainstream media outfit can drown it.

Speak your mind! This is the best time to become the best Filipino you can ever be!

Lets protect the Filipino democracy.

#NasaanSiLeni: Leni meets Fil-Am pregnancy doctor before Manila flight,"In my recently published article Globetrotting Leni humiliates self with New Year message, I explained that the Vice-president Leni Robredos silence after Typhoon Nina decimated the Bicol region is mind-boggling.


That is, Robredo has yet to make a public appearance up to this day, or seven days after Nina hit Bicol. So far, she has used only three avenues to communicate: Social media, written statements, and VP Spokesperson Georgina Hernandez.

Let me quote a part it:
Is Leni so busy that she cannot even spare two minutes to record a message of consolation for Ninas victims? What the hell is she so preoccupied with that a mere two minutes of talk time is too much to ask from her? Yes, its been seven days since Nina decimated Bicol, and Leni is still nowhere to be found.
Is she currently medically incapacitated?

Leni cant send a personal message, let alone visit, her typhoon-ravaged hometown just because she had to attend a family reunion planned over a year ago?

We all know thats bullshit, because this is not her style.

2014 Throwback: Leni and Typhoon Glenda
Let me quote a 2014 report about what Robredo did during Typhoon Glenda [PNM]:
The Bicol National Associations of America hosted by the Midwest chapter headed by Evelyn Tolledo will be held on July 25-27 at the Hilton Hotel in Rosemont, Illinois. Rep. Leni Robredo was scheduled to be the keynote speaker but cancelled her engagement because of the timing of the devastation of Typhoon Glenda.
VP Robredo, the Filipino People deserve one hell of an explanation for your absence. The problem, however, is you chose not to speak, despite your penchant for speaking too often.
There has to be something really pressing for Leni to defy common sense. There has to be.

But Leni has continually refused to provide a satisfactory explanation [TP: NY Msg] so we, the Filipino People, will try to find that explanation ourselves.

New Years Eve
After article came out, more information came in. I guess this is the cool part about having hundreds of thousands of followers: my followers become my eyes.

I need to be very careful in writing this article, so I asked the helped of several lawyer friends to make sure that everything on this article is above-board.

Lets go.
On 31 December 2016, a well-placed source told me:
Leni still in NY but is flying home Dec 31 midnight but she insists on a dinner that same night. She may miss flight kung ganyan. Maybe her dinner is with Loida. You never know.
The Loida part is too speculative. However, I can deduce the following from this piece of intel:
That she will be flying back to Manila on New Years eve at around midnight, depending on the time zone.
That she will meet someone for dinner, someone so important that she might actually miss her flight.
What piqued my interest was the second part: who did she meet?


A Geriatrics Doctor
Another source provided me with the answer in the form of photos and screenshots of the New Years Eve dinner, shown below:
The Robredo Family dining with an unidentified man.
Seen with the Robredo family is a certain Shmuel McBlow.

One Lincoln Plaza is in the heart of New York Citys cultural district. The apartments were built to an old time luxurious standard with the most up to date amenities [Ogden Properties].
Who is Shmuel McBlow?
A quick look at his Facebook profile shows:


 As it turns out, this Shmuel McBlow is actually Samuel Maghuyop.

Hmm, Shmuel McBlow makes sense, as Shmuel is a Hebrew variant of Samuel [AHN], while McBlow is a play on the Cebuano prefix mag- and huyop is Cebuano for blow [Binisaya].

Pretty witty, if you ask me. But I digress.


Who is Samuel Maghuyop?
Who is Samuel Maghuyop and why does he appear to be important, so important that Leni may miss her belated flight back to the devastated Bicol Region?

Leni can't spare a few seconds to record a message for the Bicolanos, but she had at least an hour to dine with just this man?
According to [USNews]:
Dr. Samuel Maghuyop is a geriatrics doctor in Brockton, Massachusetts and is affiliated with Signature Healthcare Brockton Hospital. He received his medical degree from University of the Philippines College of Medicine and has been in practice between 11-20 years. He is one of 4 doctors at Signature Healthcare Brockton Hospital who specialize in Geriatrics.
Dr. Maghuyop is a geriatrician [Dox], or a medical doctor who is specially trained to meet the unique healthcare needs of older adults [AGS]


Dr. Maghuyop also happens to provide offer healthcare programs for pregnant/postpartum women [AoA]. The physician directory LifeScript also lists Maghuyop under ""Doctors in Brockton, MA who treat or diagnose Pregnancy"" [LifeScript].

Hold on one second!
This bears repeating...
VP Robredo, the Filipino People deserve one hell of an explanation for your absence. The problem, however, is you chose not to speak, despite your penchant for speaking too often. But you have continually refused to provide a satisfactory explanation so we, the Filipino People, will try to find that explanation ourselves.
Now let me state the facts:
Robredo met geriatrician Dr. Samuel Maghuyop just a few hours before her midnight flight to Manila. My sources imply that Dr. Maghuyop should be very important to Robredo, considering that she could miss her flight if she meets with him at this time.
What debt of gratitude does Leni owe to Dr. Maghuyop for her to prioritize him over Bicolandia?

Now, here is the part where I need to be very careful:

FIRST, Dr. Maghuyop is a geriatrician. Geriatrics covers menopause, as evidenced by menopause being a common topic in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society [JoAGS].

SECOND, Dr. Maghuyop also caters to pregnant women [AoA].

THIRD, Leni turned 51 on 23 April 2016 [Politiko].

FOURTH, the median age of menopause for Asian women is 45 to 55 years [KKH].

FIFTH, pregnancy is possible during perimenopause [WHRI], or the the time when a women naturally starts having menopausal symptoms.

I leave the rest to you, the reader.

VP Leni Robredo, this is the problem when you dont talk, especially when the public is used to hearing you talk too often.

Georgina, good luck. [ThinkingPinoy.net]

Globetrotting Leni humiliates self with New Year message,"Vice-president Leni Robredo will need one hell of an alibi.


But first, here's a background.

USA over Bicol
On 22 December 2016, [GMA] reported that Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) will hit the Bicol Region on Christmas Day, and that Typhoon Nina is anticipated to become a Category 3 Hurricane.

Despite this warning, Vice-president Leni Robredo still decided to fly to the United States the next day [TP: White Christmas] to attend a family reunion planned more than a year ago, according to VP spokesperson Georgina Hernandez [Star].

A trip from Manila to the New York, with at most one 4-hour layover, takes anywhere from 20 to 33 hours [Flights], so its safe to say that she arrived in the United States on 24 December 2016, Manila Time.

By the time she arrived in the United States, she should have known that, Nina has further increased in strength [MB] and she should have also known by Christmas morning that Nina has become a super typhoon with winds of up to 250 kph [Star].

Nina hit Bicol on Christmas night, as anticipated.

Despite these dire developments, Robredo decided against going back home, opting to coordinate relief efforts through social media [Robredo].

Keep them coming
Robredos Christmas night tweet is as follows:
Compiling all reports now so please keep them coming. Meantime, please make sure you are all safe until the rains & winds have died down.
Now herein lies the problem.
The initial December 23rd GMA report predicted that Nina will become a Category 3 hurricane. When it hit, however, winds have reached 250 kph, indicating that it has become a Category 4 hurricane (Cat4).

The United States National Hurricane Center defines damage caused by Cat4 as follows:
Catastrophic damage will occur: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.
Alright, hold on one second: Nina is a Cat4 hurricane, so Nina is expected to down power poles so that by extension, it should also disable internet access in large swathes of land.

So what reports will the Office of the Vice-president be compiling when the fact of the matter is that those on the ground are unlikely to have access to electricity, let alone the internet?

But still, Leni decided to remain abroad.

A day later
On 26 December 2016, a day after Nina pounded Bicol, Robredo spokesperson Hernandez said [Yahoo]:
While we have faith in the resilience of our people, we still call on the Filipino public to help out in the ongoing relief efforts of all agencies and private sector partners to alleviate suffering in typhoon-hit areas during this very special time of the year.
Alright, theres another problem here: here is the Office of the Vice-president calling on the Filipino public to help out in the relief efforts, when she herself isnt there to help them, seriously?
Now, I mightve forgiven her for her ill-timed telecommuting, if not for the fact that she herself denounces what she was doing.Watch the following video:


In this October 2015 interview, Robredo said:
It is important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster.
Nina hit Bicol on Christmas day and Robredo was not in Bicol. A day later, she still wasnt in Bicol. Two days later, she still wasnt in Bicol. And today, on New Years day or seven days later, she still hasnt been to Bicol.

She is still in the United States, despite the fact that flights from the US to the Philippines were available the entire time.

Pricey, yes, but available.

Bicol is supposed to be her bailiwick while Naga City, one of the hardest-hit areas, is actually her hometown. How in the world can VP Leni convince herself that attending a family reunion is more important than attending to her own people? What the hell is this woman thinking?

Jesse Robredo must be turning in his grave. 

Six days later
Six days later on 31 December 2016, Robredo has yet to make a public appearance. So far, she only uses three avenues to communicate:
Social media (Twitter and Facebook)
Official written statements
VP Spokesperson Hernandez
Now this is very confusing for me:
Is Leni so busy that she cannot even spare two minutes to record a message of consolation for Ninas victims?

The fact that she chose a family reunion over Bicolano evacuees is bad enough. And now, she doesnt even deem the Bicolanos worthy of two minutes of her time?

Seriously, Leni, seriously?

Is this how Leni interprets her catch-phrase laylayan ng lipunan (fringes of society)?

This doesnt make sense. No vice-president can be THAT busy. Cant she even record a 30-second message while pooping in the toilet? Shes THAT busy?

Somethings wrong
No one is that busy. Even the President Duterte, who is about 20 years her senior and massively busier than her, found the time to visit Bicol. Does even one of the reports Leni compiled indicate how much damage Bicol actually suffered?




Lenis indifference is utterly surreal, so much so that there should be at least one intergalactically compelling reason why she is acting this way.
Is she too busy plotting an ouster with Loida Nicolas-Lewis [Plan 0117]?
Is she too busy with her personal relationships [TP: Frailties]?
Is she too busy enjoying the snow [TP: Hypocrisy]?
What the hell is she so preoccupied with that a mere two minutes of talk time is too much to ask from her? Yes, its been seven days since Nina decimated Bicol, and Leni is still nowhere to be found.
Is she currently medically incapacitated?
With Lenis absence, I cannot help but suspect that its Georgina whos been making the calls since Christmas day. Yes, I suspect that Georgina has been our VP this past week.

Poor Georgina, Leni should give her a pay raise for crying out loud!

Leni supporters rebut
A few Leni supporters went to the ThinkingPinoy facebook page and pointed out that she has finally released a recorded video several hours ago, so I went to Robredos official page to check it out.

The video they were pointing out was a New Years Day message from Robredo [FB]. A snapshot of the recording is shown below:

Okay, I will admit that I was initially surprised. I was like, Wow, I might actually be wrong!

But Robredo knows full well when New Years Day will arrive, so its easy to pre-record a New Years Day message before she flew to the United States.


Now, take a closer look at the dress shes wearing in the recording. It is actually the same dress she wore on 23 December 2016, or a day prior to her departure for the United States.
But Leni is known for repeating outfits [Inq], so maybe she just accidentally wore the same thing on different days, right?

Well, if she indeed recorded this video after December 23, then it must have been on the evening of December 24th (Manila Time) onwards. She couldnt have recorded it earlier than that because she was still on a flight. But if she recorded this on the evening of the 24th at the earliest, then she recorded this at a time when she was already aware of whats happening in Bicol.

But there was no mention of Typhoon Nina anywhere in the video.

Yes, this newly-uploaded New Years Day message was recorded on or before December 23rd.

PR Gaffe after PR Gaffe
Whats even more hilarious are some  of the lines used in the video.
Kung may katiwasayan sa ating mga tahanan, mananatili tayong malakas, kahit anong unos pa ang maaring yumanig sa ating bayan.
[TRANSLATION: If there is calmness in our homes, we will stay resilient, regardless of the storms that may shake our nation.]

Well, the Camarines Sur Sports Complex begs to disagree [Politiko]. Aside from the devastation, Nina also displaced over 380,000 people [Star], all while Leni is getting chummy with family in the United States.
The Camarines Sur Sports Complex before and after #NinaPH
Now, let's move on to the next one:
Ang taong mga lugmok sa kahirapan ay humihiyaw sa galit, at bakit naman hindi? Sila naman talaga ang dapat pinakikinggan ng ating pamahalaan at nating lahat.
[TRANSLATION: The helplessly poor are screaming in anger and why shouldnt they? They really are the ones whom the government and everyone else should listen to.]


Now, how can VP Leni expect the helplessly poor to tweet reports that she will compile? How will she listen to them when shes literally on the other side of the planet? How, just how?
Mahalin natin ang simpleng pamumuhay at simpleng kaligayahan.

[TRANSLATION: Lets embrace a simple lifestyle and simple joys.]

I doubt that a tri-state US vacation qualifies as a simple lifestyle. Moreover, preferring to attend a family reunion in the US to attending to poor Bicolanos (who are about to get annihilated by a super typhoon) hardly qualifies as simple joys.

Do not get me wrong: I have been to the United States myself, but unlike Leni, I never had the gall to promote a simple lifestyle and simple joys.

The hypocrisy is strong on this Robredo.
Palalimin ang paraan ng pagsisilbi sa ating minamahal at lawakan ang ating pang-unawa sa mga nasa laylayan ng lipunan.
[TRANSLATION: Deepen our ways of serving loved ones and broaden our understanding of those in the fringes of society.]

Well, it appears that Leni doesnt understand what a catastrophic hurricane means, so I doubt that she can ever sufficiently understand the struggle of those in the laylayan.

Now, its interesting to note that Leni awkwardly pronounced nawa and katiwasayan at the start of her video message, suggesting that she was reading from a teleprompter.

Leni, dont tell me that you didnt write that yourself. Did Georgina write it for you again? Maybe its time to kick you out of your office and let Georgina take over.

But I digress.

No, this video was recorded before Leni left for the US. Any self-respecting OVP employee would be smart enough to avoid those lines mentioned above, in light of the Lenis Year-end PR nightmare.

TPs Takeaways
To cut the long story short, the vice-president is still nowhere to be found seven days after a typhoon bulldozed her hometown. Apathy and misplaced priorities are possible explanations, but the OVP will deny both, of course. Instead, OVP should come up with an acceptable alibi for her absence.

Personally, I cannot think of any other possible alibi for her except medical incapacitation.
Was she suffering from the after-effects of general anaesthesia this entire week?
Is she suffering from a condition that we do not know of?

Maybe yes, maybe no, but I still look forward to witnessing more of Georginas creativity: I want to see what she'll pull out of her a$$ this time.

#OustDuterte: Will Goldbergs Plan Work?,"A few days ago, the Manila Times reported that former US Ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg outlined a strategy to oust the democratically-elected President Rodrigo Duterte from Malacaang.

Will the 18-month ouster plan work?

Goldbergs strategy: a run down
The Manila Times described Goldbergs strategic recommendations as follows:
Public Dissatisfaction: stoking public dissatisfaction with the President over unfulfilled election promises
International Isolation: isolating the Philippines from the rest of the ASEAN by extending military assistance to member countries except the Philippines
Economic Blackmail: limiting trade by some ASEAN member countries with the Philippines.
Liberal Party Funding: support for the Philippine opposition through aids and grants
Division: sowing discontent among the Duterte supporters
Political Disunity: cultivating the cleavage between the congressmen and the senators over the Charter Change issue
Ambassador Goldberg
Some may be inclined to dismiss MTs report as a mere conspiracy theory. The problem, however, is that Goldberg has a history of undermining governments.

In 2007, the United States was accused of funding opposition to Bolivian President Evo Morales by providing opposition leaders and critical think-tanks with millions of dollars [MT] through its philanthropic arm USAID.

In 2008, Bolivian President Evo Morales declared Goldberg persona non grata.

Morales eventually expelled USAID from Bolivia in 2013[BBC].

Yes, Goldberg did something like it not too long ago.

Moreover, Dutertes claim that US ambassadors are spies [CNBC] is not without merit, at least in the Philippine context.

Goldberg himself was the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research (US DoS INR) from 09 February 2010 [USGov] until 14 February 2014 [US DoS].

If Intelligence and Research doesnt scream Spy! to you, nothing else will.

And by the way, Goldberg was appointed Ambassador to Manila on 31 July 2013 [GMA], while he was still the US DoS INR head.

Goldberg apparently didnt waste time, as he got the ball rolling as soon as he arrived in Manila.


Funding the Liberal Party
In October 2013, USAID gave $24 million (Php 984 million) to the Philippines Gerry Roxas Foundation (GRF) [Star, USAID], purportedly to develop non-government organizations in the Philippines.
Named after Liberal Party (LP) President Mar Roxas father, GRF is headed by Roxas own mother, Judy Araneta-Roxas, and among the members of the board are Maria Rosario Charo Santos-Concio and Marixi R. Prieto [GRF].

Santos-Concio was ABS-CBNs CEO and President from 2008 to 2016 [Inq], and is currently its Chief Content Officer [ABS]. Meanwhile, Prieto is Inquirers chairman to date [Inq].

Nobody could have predicted Dutertes rise to power, so the 2013 grant, at best, could have been Goldbergs means to pay it forward, i.e. to gain the loyalty of LP and friends.

And the financial gesture is now bearing fruit.
Today, the Inquirer and ABS-CBN are the staunchest critics of the Duterte Administration, and both show a patent bias in favor of the Liberal Party [TP: Kill List; TP: Karen Davila].

I would like to expound more on this issue, but I think you already got my point, as the USAIDs gesture is in consonance with Point No. 4 of Goldbergs strategy, and that it is all-too-similar to what Goldberg did to Bolivia.

But

Golbergs strategy, while quite convincing, has several critical weaknesses that undermine its feasibility. In particular, Philip Goldbergs ouster plan requires at least three crucial elements:

 Time, as the ouster plan takes 18 months to implement
 Approval, as such a plot requires the State Departments imprimatur
 Replacement, as ousting Duterte requires an acceptable replacement
Time and Approval
I believe Goldbergs Seven-Point strategy can be implemented in 18 months. The problem, however, is whether Goldberg has the 18 months to do it in the first place.

I have reason to believe that Goldberg prepared this strategy with the assumption that Hillary Clinton, a known proponent of Humanitarian Intervention [WaTimes], will succeed US President Barack Obama. For one, Clintons likely Pentagon Chief already started advocating for more bombing and intervention in as early as June 2016 [Intercept].


Humanitarian intervention is a euphemism for militarily coercing other states to get things done [Global Policy].


Well, everybody thought Clinton would win. That is, until Republican candidate Donald Trump rained on Clintons parade in November.

Now, will Goldberg be able to convince a Trump-era State Department?

The answer is probably no based on three grounds:

FIRST: Unlike Clinton, Trump is predicted to be a generally inward-looking president, i.e. someone who is less likely to espouse Humanitarian Intervention [ATimes], when compared to the warmonger Hillary.

SECOND: Goldbergs career is too closely associated with Clinton and the Democrats [Star], a fact that the Republicans will surely detest.

THIRD: Among other things, Clintons 2009 appointment of Goldberg as coordinator of the implementation of sanctions against North Korea, was detested by American Career Diplomats[WaTimes], so Philip may expect resistance from the Diplomatic Establishment.

And theres one major challenge facing Goldbergs Strategy: Leni Robredo.

The Replacement
Any ouster plot requires a suitable replacement to one who will be ousted. In this case, it should be Vice-president Maria Leonor Leni Robredo of the Liberal Party, and even LPs senior management will agree that there is no other alternative replacement.

And thats the problem.

After quitting the Duterte Cabinet earlier in December, Robredos net satisfaction rating plummeted a mere +37 in December 2016 from +49 the previous month [Star]. Meanwhile, Dutertes satisfaction rating remained virtually unchanged at +63 in December 2016 from +64 three months earlier [Inq].

Now, imagine how the public would react if a +63 is replaced by a +37.

It wouldnt be pretty, to say the least.

But it gets worse: Lenis decision to take a vacation in the United States despite an impending disaster in her bailiwick is expected to exacerbate Lenis popularity issue [TP: White Christmas].

The Bumbling Replacement
This has led many to question Lenis true character.

In a 2015 interview, Robredo said it is very important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster.


Well, Leni was on the other side of the planet when Super Typhoon Nina was pounding the Bicol Region. And six days later, Leni has yet to release even a pre-recorded message to console the Bicolanos.

Right now, all she could manage are tweets and written statements, messages that easily be created by her staff, who are probably busy doing damage control while their boss is missing.

Meanwhile, Duterte himself went to Bicol to visit the typhoon victims, where he said:

I am here because I know that we have to be here during this time.


I am not sure if this is a swipe at Robredos obvious absence, but it sure appears like one.

And for an extremely popular leader to remind everything that his potential replaced is not there for them

Well, you know the drill.

We can expect Lenis +37 to go down even further come the next survey period, because what she did during the holidays is far worse than anything she did before [TP: Thief in the Night].

To cut the long story short, the Filipino People will not accept Leni Robredo.

Epilogue
I believe that Goldbergs Seven-Point Strategy will not work because it lacks the three crucial elements explained in the previous sections. This does not, however, prevent the Liberal Party from attempting their last hurrah.

Remember that LPs most powerful ally, the US Democratic Party [TP: Trump], is still in power until the Republican Trumps January 20th inauguration. That is, LP may still attempt a power grab before that date [TP: Plan 0117].

While I am confident that LP will still ultimately fail, I am also pretty certain that such a last-minute power grab attempt will be messy, if not bloody.

But in this world, nothing is certain except uncertainty, so let us all be vigilant. Let us not allow these scheming elites take away our right to choose our leader.


Our forefathers have sacrificed their lives so that we may be able to choose our nation's destiny. Because of their sacrifice, the governments power now emanates from us, the Filipino People.

#NinaPH: When Leni left us like a thief in the night,"My friends and I have talked about Leni Robredo since the time she rose to national fame after the death in 2012 of her husband, the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo. For the next couple of years, she established a reputation for having a modest lifestyle. Do you still remember the time when she ditched the SONA Red Carpet and used the Batasan Pambansa backdoor entrance instead?

Yes, she's the simple and meek widow that is Leni Robredo. For years, I had a positive opinion of her. That is, until I started my blog ThinkingPinoy, until I started looking harder into what have transpired in the past several years.


The First Red Flag 
I started having suspicions about Lenis qualifications as a government official when I first heard the rumor that she flunked her bar exams, a rumor that was later verified when Leni admitted it herself [Inq].

While failing the bar is not the end of the world, I was never able to wrap my head around the idea that someone who aspires to be the second most powerful person in the Philippines is not the sharpest tool in the shed.

When I chat with friends, I often explain my position on that matter by using an analogy.
I ask them, If you need to undergo a major surgery, would you be okay with having a surgeon who flunked the medical board?

They answer back, Of course, not!

Then I ask, If we need new and better legislation, would you be okay with having a legislator who flunked the bar exams?

They answer back, Of course, not!

Then I ask, ""And what if that legislator wanted to be vice-president?""

Then an eerie silence.

Yup, theres something wrong somewhere in this equation.

Lenis Contradictions
Yes, I started to have my doubts about the Leni Robredo as painted by the media, so I revisited the SONA Red Carpet Incident that basically transformed a simple widow into a national symbol of humility.

The story goes something like this:
Leni used the backdoor entrance to avoid the attention usually accorded to politicians and celebrities attending the annual State of the Nation address. I can only surmise that Leni didnt like the attention, the pomp, and the pageantry, and that she attended the SONA with a sincere objective of being the representative of the People and nothing more.
She purportedly didnt like the attention, but she publicized a photo of the incident herself [FB].

Hates the attention, then craved for the attention?
Robredos own office bragged about her humility. 

Wow! thats so humble of her.

Oh, and do you remember the viral 2014 Leni-taking-a-bus PR stunt?

The Inquirer described the photo (shown below) as taken by the lawmakers friend Keisha del Castillo last December 4, showed a woman waiting alone at a gas station in Magallanes, Makati City, donned in a striped shirt and denim pants and carrying two bags [Inq].

Photo Courtesy of Leni Robredo's Chief of Staff (she literally took the photo)
As it turns out, this Keisha del Castillo is not only Robredos friend, but also her long-time staffer. Based on her [LinkedIn] account, del Castillo was Lenis Head Executive Assistant at the time the photo was taken.


She then became Robredos Chief of Staff and eventually, the head of Private and Ceremonial Affairs Office under the Office of the Vice-president.

In short, Robredos own office bragged again about her humility, even going as far as creating a video about it two years later, for use as 2016 campaign material.

See no Evil in Roxas' Campaign Planes
And do you still remember the Liberal Partys campaign planes?


For someone who allegedly espouses good governance, I cannot, for the life of me, understand how she could stomach riding Roxass campaign planes when they were owned and funded by illegal miner Eric Guttierez, the same illegal miner who cheated on his taxes, destroyed an entire town, and terrorized its townsfolk [TP: Campaign Planes].
But I am a political realist, so I have resigned myself to the idea that every politician lies and cheats and the only thing that varies is the degree in which they do it. Thus, until election election day, Robredo was my Number 2 pick. That is, if my primary bet Alan Peter Cayetano loses, I sincerely wished that she win instead.

And she won, and she got worse.

Lenis SOCE
Leni managed to raise my eyebrows when I found out that she spent P418 million during the 2016 campaign, or about 30% more than the second-biggest VP spender Chiz Escudero [CNN].

And where did she get the money? She said she got it from creative volunteers, including a Lugawan [ABS].

Thats one hell of lugaw vendor if you ask me.


From that ABS-CBN report, it appears that she has a very good idea as to where her campaign money came from, yet she still failed to file her Statements of Campaign Expenditures on time. To make matters worse, she even cited an obsolete Comelec resolution to justify the tardiness [TP: SOCE].

Yes, heres a lawyer who doesnt know the laws that apply to her.

But it still gets worse.

Lenis Knee
Then came the Le-Knee incident, where she blasted the President for commenting about her knees.
Tasteless remarks and inappropriate advances against women should have no place in our society. We should expect that most of all from our leaders, Robredo told [CNN] a day after the November incident.
Yes, the humble and meek widow has metamorphosed into Our Lady of Naga.


But what I still fail to understand is how Leni could find a joke about knees anti-woman, when she finds physical contact with a married man acceptable?

Robredo (L) with QC Rep. Banal

The man closest to her at the moment, Quezon City Representative Bolet Banal, is married.

This also begs the question, Why still capitalize on the legacy of your dead husband when you seem to have a suitable replacement already?

Theres a word for it: Hypocrisy.

But it gets worse.

EJKs and HUDCC
Just three weeks into the vice-presidency, Robredo started to decry extrajudicial killings allegedly committed by the Duterte Administration [Star]. She yakked about it month after month, and she still yaks about it up to this day [CNN]. Five months have passed since she first mentioned EJKs, yet she still fails to provide even an iota of evidence showing that these killings were state-sponsored.

President Duterte, probably out of exasperation, even went as far telling her on 17 December 2016:

You can ask even one [of the government forces] if I ordered them to kill a person whose body was in a kneeling position and hands were tied at the back. Ask one of them. If someone says Duterte [ordered that], I will resign. I will resign tomorrow [SunStar].
It has been ten days since Duterte unleashed that dare, yet Leni has yet to respond.

After her much-publicized resignation from the Duterte Cabinet, many of her critics (and there are lots of them) see Robredo as a NATO leader.

Whats NATO?

Its a colloquial acronym for No Action, Talk Only.

Why so?

Because a closer look at her purported achievements shows that it's mostly made up of meetings, conferences, paperwork, and little else. Even the implementing rules and regulations of a small section of a 1992 Republic Act took her five months to draft [CNN].

Yes, it appears that Robredo suffers from the same illness Roxas had: Analysis Paralysis [IBTimes].

But then, there still was a small part of me that wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. After all, shes been in office of just five months.

Leni just had to have the right opportunity to show her capacity for action.

And that opportunity came. And the opportunitys name is Nina.

Nina and the ""Mother of the Nation""
On 22 December 2016, [GMA] reported that Typhoon Nina (International Name: Nock-ten) was about to hit the Philippines, and that it was expected to make landfall on the Bicol Region  Lenis own bailiwick  on Christmas Day. According to the report, Nina was anticipated to become a Category 3 Hurricane.

The United States National Hurricane Center describes a Category 3 Hurricane as:
Devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes [NHC].
By 23 December 2016 (Manila), NASAs Aqua Satellite showed Nina has intensified [Phys].


In preparation, the Duterte Government has evacuated hundreds of thousands of Bicolanos to safer areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is on heightened alert, while Social Welfare Sec. Judy Taguiwalo has activated response clusters to ensure close coordination and quick mobilization of assistance for communities likely to be affected by the typhoon [Star].

Yes, even on Christmas Day, the Duterte Government is at work: no vacations, no days off, no R and R... while Leni did the exact opposite.

Despite all thats happening, Robredo still decided to leave the country for a US vacation. Take a look at the following image taken at NAIA at 4:40 PM Friday, 23 December 2016.
Bon Voyage!
Like a thief in the night
This is the problem when a politician conducts too many press conferences: people notice bouts of deafening silence.

No, the US-bound flight was not part of an official trip, as Robredos official trips are very well-publicized ahead of time. This is a personal trip that Robredo herself knows is ill-timed.

This woman, my friends, is part of the group that calls for Duterte's resignation, the same group who's plotting his ouster [TP: Plan 0117]. The same woman who will become President should that call be heeded.

The same woman who loves to contradict herself.

Lets recall a 20 October 2015 interview where she herself said:
Most of our local officials look at disaster risk management as mere(ly) being ready with relief goods when a disaster strikes. I painstakingly told them that this is so much more than this The thing were doing now is more of a symbol than anything else. It is giving a message to the people that the government is there for them. Ive been in the local scene for so long, my husband was mayor for so long, it is very important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster.

Now, Robredo herself said it is very important for local folks to see their government officials during and right after a disaster.

Straight from the horses mouth, and  where was she while Nina was pummeling her hometown in Bicol?

Vacationing in the United States.

Leni left the Philippines last Friday knowing full well that shes badly needed by Bicolandia. She left despite her full knowledge that she must stay.

In short, she left the Philippines for the United States like a thief in the night.",RJ Nieto,"December 26, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/12/ninaph-when-leni-robredo-left-us-like-thief-in.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
A White Christmas: The Hypocrisy of Maria Leonor Gerona Robredo,"Earlier this month, Robredo said she will not allow the Vice Presidency to be stolen [Inq].

I am not exactly sure how the Vice-presidency could be stolen from her. Surely, no one would be stupid enough to launch a risky and costly coup detat just to steal a position with no power in it. But if Leni is talking about a potential loss in the Bongbong Marcos electoral protest case, then how can it be called stealing?

Will a prospectively adverse Supreme Court decision on the case be tantamount to stealing? Who is Leni to decide when stealing happens? Does Leni want to usurp the power of the judiciary too?

But I digress.


The word stealing is used with things that hold value, so Leni finds value in her position as VP. If being a vice-president is so valuable to her, why cant she be a vice-president when it matters the most? Is Leni VP just for the bragging rights? Did she become VP just for the sake of having the position?

Because apparently, she is not too keen with the responsibilities associated with the position.

Leni and Typhoon Nina
The Bicol Region braces for the arrival of Super Typhoon Nina tonight. With winds of up to 135 knots (250 kph) [Navy], Nina's is, in some respects, comparable to Typhoon Yolanda, which had winds of up to 125 knots (230 kph) [Tokyo]. Yes, Nina can potentially annihilate entire cities, similar to how Yolanda erased the cities of Guiuan and Tacloban in 2013.
In preparation, the government has evacuated hundreds of thousands of Bicolanos to safer areas. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is on heightened alert, while Social Welfare Sec. Judy Taguiwalo has activated response clusters to ensure close coordination and quick mobilization of assistance for communities likely to be affected by the typhoon [Star].

Yes, even on Christmas Day, the government is at work: no vacations, no days off, no R&R.

With the exception of Vice-president Leni Robredo.

Lenis US getaway
Yesterday, two independent sources informed me that Leni Robredo recently entered the United States via New York City and is said to be planning to stay in the said country until New Year's Day. She also visited New Jersey and is currently ""with family"" in Pennsylvania [FB].

It's bad enough that her attack dogs Sen. Leila de Lima and Sen. Antonio Trillanes showed an appalling lack of delicadeza [MT, MT].
But for her to visit New York City, the same city where billionaire Fil-Am lobbyist Loida Nicolas-Lewis is based... That just screams ""Scheming bitch!"" for me [TP: Plan 0117].

Is orchestrating a power grab more important for Leni than actually helping those in the ""laylayan""?

Millions of poor, innocent Filipino lives are at risk, while the countrys vice-president is too busy enjoying a White Christmas.

In defense, one of Robredos most ardent supporters argued that Leni went on a Christmas vacation in the United States because spending the holidays in Naga City brings back too many painful memories of the late Jesse Robredo.

Thats bullshit.

Lenis Feelings
The ""feelings alibi"" won't fly.

First, Jesse died four years ago and Leni has already found a replacement in Congressman Bolet Banal [TP: Lenis Frailties]. Besides, the entire Robredo family even spent Christmas Eve 2014 at Jesses grave. Just look at the screencap shown below.
Christmas Eve 2014

Second, are the personal feelings of an alleged vice-president more important than her mandate to serve the people or as the Liberal Party Youth puts it, her mandate to be the mother of this god-forsaken nation [KALIPI]?

After the storm has passed and thousands of homes have been destroyed, can she realistically tell Bicolanos, Sorry, I had to attend first to my feelings before I can attend to you., or worse, ""Sorry I can't be your leader today because I'm too heartbroken.""?

Third and most importantly, why the United States? Theres Pili, Daet, Legazpi, Sorsogon, Virac, Tabaco the list of cheaper (and wiser) alternatives goes on and on.

Leni' #Opulent Getaway
In her 2015 SALN, Leni declared a net worth of Php 8 million, with cash assets amounting to Php 10.3 million [Malaya]. Assuming a modest Php 1 million to cover her week-long family trip, does it mean that she is willing to throw away 12% of her net worth in the span of a week?

That doesn't sound very #Tsinelas to me.

Either Leni has terrible financial planning skills, or her trip was financed by someone else.

I know Leni isn't the sharpest tool in the shed: she flunked the Bar Exams [Inq], and she even showed her ignorance of the law [TP: SOCE], but I am inclined to believe that she cannot be that financially imbecilic, i.e. she probably got some financial help from someone else.

But if she indeed received travel perks, wouldn't that fall under the same category as PNP Chief Bato dela Rosa's Las Vegas issue [Inq]?

After January 1st, will Conchita be as busy as she was when Bato arrived from Vegas, or will Conchita play dead, like what she did on the de Lima drug case [Inq]?

Lenis Tsinelas
Like what I said yesterday, I personally wouldn't have cared where she spends her holidays. But last time I checked, she's all for modesty of public servants, hence her #TsinelasLeadership PR stunt.

Leni in her #Tsinelas
Lenis trademark #Tsinelas centers on modesty of public officials. How can she reconcile that with a Tri-state White Christmas in the US, while millions of those in the laylayan are at risk of death?

The hypocrisy is strong on this one.
We were given an early reminder of that reality when a grenade exploded during a Christmas Eve mass in Midsayap, North Cotabato, hurting 13 [Star].

Duterte immediately visited the blast victims the following morning [ABS], offering financial assistance and lightening up their mood by cracking jokes. Dutertes visit will not magically heal the wounded, but it will sure give hope not only to them, but also to the rest of the country who are in desperate need of it.


And wheres Leni? Too busy having a vacation on the other side of the planet.

Yes, I admit that the Office of the Vice-president has no real powers, except the power to replace Duterte if or when he dies, resigns, or is removed. However, isnt it incumbent upon the vice-president to at least serve her ceremonial duties to the fullest?

If the only thing the VP can do is lift peoples spirits up, then why dont she do it when it really counts?

No cant do: Lenis on vacay.

I don't know if it's just me, but if I fear losing something valuable, I will fight tooth and nail to show everyone I deserve it.

Leni, however, has better ideas on how to go about it.",RJ Nieto,"December 25, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/12/a-white-christmas-hypocrisy-of-maria.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"#OustDuterte: Leila, Leni, Lourdes, Loida, LP, and Plan 0117","Lets talk about what this new plan could be, a plan that I call Plan Q1 2017. In yesterdays #OustDuterte: Daddy D worries about a 1st Quarter Ouster Plot?, I enumerated the five major players involved in this plot.


They are:
LEILA: Sen. Leila de Lima handles international opinion7
LP: The Liberal Party handles political machinery
LOIDA: Loida Nicolas-Lewis handles finances
LOURDES: Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno keeps the enemy at bay, and
LENI: Vice-president Leni Robredo serves as Cory Aquino 2.0, Dutertes replacement.
You probably wonder: why Q1 2017?

Why should LP effect an ouster move in the first quarter of 2017?

Let me answer that.

Actually, calling the ouster plot Plan Q1 2017 is not very accurate, as that means the plan may take effect somewhere between New Years Day and the end of March. After some thought, I realized that if Plan Q1 2017 is to be implemented, it should be on the first half of January 2017.

For this reason, lets rename Plan Q1 2017 to Plan 0117, where 0117 denotes January 2017.

Lets ask a new, more specific question: why January 2017?

Why Plan 0117?
Why January 2017?

There are three reasons why an ouster plot should be complete by mid-January 2017.

First is international  recognition.
Philippine Presidents can be constitutionally removed in three ways: resignation, death, or impeachment. The first two are out of the question, and after the old man appointed Mark Villar, impeachment is impossible at least up to 2019 [TP: Plan B].

Thus, Leni and LP are left with three extraconstitutional, extrajudicial options:  assassination,  coup dtat, or  people power (not that theres much of a difference between  and ).
Should Leni and LP implement any of the three methods, the final result will be an extraconstitutional power transition, which would require the newly-formed government to seek international recognition.

And whats the single biggest step towards international recognition?

Getting recognition from the United States.

However, Leni and LPs political connections in the United States are largely confined within the Democratic Party led by US President Barack Obama and losing 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Thus, if Leni and LP will oust Daddy D, they will need to oust him while they are still in power. However, Obama is in power only until January 21, 2017 local time, as President-elect Donald Trump takes his oath of office at 12 NN EST, 20 January 2017 [Telegraph], or 1:00 AM 21 Jan 2017 Manila.

Second is BBMs electoral protest.
The entire ouster plot rests on the assumption that Leni will succeed Duterte, but this wont happen if Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos (BBM) replaces Leni per a successful electoral protest, and a closer look at the developments of the protest case doesnt bode well for Robredo.

Per Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET) Rules [A.M. No. 10-4-29-SC], there are 21 steps involved in hearing the electoral protest case. The ball started rolling pretty fast after BBM filed the case on 29 June 2016 [Star] and by August 17th, the case was already at Step 6 [BBM].

Now, step 7 is the part where the Supreme Court issues a Notice of Preliminary Conference. Four months after Step 6, the Supreme Court has yet to call for a preliminary conference.

Then everything stopped.
But who handles the scheduling for PET? Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, and I can see two major motives:
Lourdes is staunchly anti-Marcos. She even voted against the Marcos LNMB burial [GMA].
Lourdes is already losing her grip on the SC after nine justices denounced her machinations at the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) [Interaksyon], and shes about to lose it fully as Duterte appoints 10 justices from now until October 2019 [TP: SC Math].

By the way, Duterte is already about to appoint two: Justice Perez retired on 14 December 2016 [SunStar] and Justice Brion is set to retire on 29 December 2016 [Star].

Yes, a Duterte Presidency is bad for Lourdes, so Lourdes has to stall.

But she has been stalling for four months already, and BBM supporters  millions of them  are bound to notice really, really soon.

Third, the weather.
Sounds really stupid, but it really is an important factor.

Recall that Duterte can be ousted via assassination, coup dtat, and People Power. However, I think an assassination is out of the picture because the Presidential Security Group has a pretty good track record of keeping presidents alive. Thus, we are left with two: coup dtat, and People Power.
A coup dtat is insufficient by itself because of the military and the police being largely loyal to Duterte. Will AFP Chief Visaya or PNP Chief Bato stage a coup? Of course not, so its going to be someone whos not in the core leadership.

Why the loyalty? This.

Trillanes (or one of them drug-generals) do not exercise complete control over the military. That is, whoever minor general or officer stages a coup, he will not end up leading the military.

Heres where People Power becomes the primary mode of ouster, with the coup detat serving a supplementary role. But People Power requires lots of people, and the only time you can mobilize people for days is when the weather is kind.


People Power can never happen from March to May because the demonstrators will die from heatstroke. It cant be from June to October because of the rainy season (i.e. floods). And November-December is the Christmas Season: people are simply too busy with their own lives.

Yes, People Power is most feasible if held during the first couple of months of the year.

Plan 0117 Recipe 
Now that we have discussed the Why, its time to talk about the How.

Step 1: Set a deadline
The key date is January 20th, which is Trumps inauguration. If I were one of them ouster plotters, I will stage the People Power revolution just a few days after New Years Day. Remember that it takes several days for People Power to work, and several more days for the international community to react, so finishing the process several days before Obama steps down is crucial.

Just look at this meme that Silent No More posted on 20 December 2016 [FB].

Silent No More's December 10 2016 Facebook meme

As discussed earlier, the BBM electoral protest case, has been in suspended animation since September, so how in the world would the High Court rule on it if it hasnt even conducted a preliminary conference?

More than anything else, this meme is an attempt at mind conditioning.


The page suggests that if something has to be done, it has to be done before 10 January 2017.

Step 2: Gain local legitimacy
After gaining international legitimacy, the next step would be gaining recognition from the Filipino Public. This is tricky for LP, as Duterte has maintained high popularity ratings [CCTV] despite the negative coverage from local and international media.

LP and the gang recently tried to drum up support for Dutertes ouster by capitalizing on the Marcos Burial Issue [MT], but to no avail. It appears that Dutertes Teflon Status [TP: BangkoSerye] is still in effect up to this day.

If real local support cannot be obtained, then the next best thing would be to use something akin to real local support, which brings us to


Step 3: Mobilize People
Manileos are unlikely to join any LP-led People Power Revolution, because Manileos voted overwhelmingly in favor of BBM [GMA]. That is, if Leni wants a mass demonstration, she will need hakot crowds from nearby provinces such as Laguna.

Earlier this month, Greco Belgica said VP Leni was in Laguna on 11 December 2016 and met with a certain Mayor at a golf course to ask help to gather people  hakot  for a rally they will stage [FB: Belgica].

I tried to verify Belgicas intel, and I found out from an independent source that while a Jesse-Robredo-protg-cum-Laguna-politico declined Lenis request, many local politicos didnt. Add hakot crowds from Bicol and elsewhere, and the numbers should be sufficient to stage a massive demonstration a la EDSA People Power.

Step 4: Gain Military-Police Support
I doubt that any People Power-esque demonstration will be successful, as that would require military and police defections, which are unlikely [TP: Martial Law].

Loyalty of the military and the police, however, may not be as iron-clad as pro-Duterte camps would hope. For one, the drug-linked PNP generals [Journal] may still command some loyalty, especially to low-ranking cops who benefitted from the drug trade.


More importantly, some AFP generals loyal to Aquino or the Drug Cartels may still switch sides.

Yes, Duterte did not link AFP generals when he announced the first drug list in July, but given how corrupt the government is pre-Duterte, what are the odds that more than a few generals, colonels, and majors, also partake of the illegal drug largesse?

Thats something that the Duterte Government may want to check on.

Oh, and did I mention the intel I got a few weeks ago [FB]?

A source who belongs to a prominent group of active and retired military officers said a fallen lady cabinet member had two low key meetings with a former president, among others. One the other week, and the more secret one last week.

Source was already telling the others na may binabalak. Of course, our President has his sources too. It is a power grab trying to cite incompetence. They are trying to smear him and Dela Rosa. If you noticed, a lady senator's controversy is their smoke screen, and her fellow senator-ally is trying to drum up support in and out.

They have connections in the US Embassy, whose security officers are loyal to senator-ally. They are the ones feeding negative info and translations about PRRD.

Source said he/she got info that they are feeding info to international sympathizers. They are also trying to paint our president as a coddler of the corrupt and as the real crime and drug syndicate coddler. They are investing on PR firms. 2 big ones.

They are trying to set the stage for a people power and/or coup d'etat as the senator-ally, despite his infamy, still enjoys the loyalty of his classmates.
Go figure.

Step 5: Gain International Recognition
Leilas moves are already very well known. As a matter of fact, her actions since June 30th may already constitute a pretty strong case of inciting to sedition [TP: Sedition]. And to make sure that the international community never forgets LPs international propaganda, the yellows even orchestrated a global anti-Duterte media blitz in the first week of December, as pointed out by my journalist-friend Krizette Chu [FB].

The alleged extrajudicial killings in the Drug War should be enough for a prospective Duterte overthrow to gain international legitimacy, i.e. the anti-Duterte propaganda likely puts the global public at a better position to recognize the legitimacy of whoever replaces the old man, i.e. VP Leni Robredo [TP: Chito Gascon].

The success rate of this ouster plot wouldve been better if Hillary won, as the Liberal Party-aligned Washington lobby group US-Philippines Society, where Loida is a director and Manny V Pangilinan is co-chair, identify as Democrats. Loida even donated to the 2016 Clinton campaign [TP: Trump].

Too bad Trump won.

But LP and the gang has gone this far, so I guess they still feel that the show must go on.

What can we do?
Assassination attempts are best dealt with by the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP). For prospective coup attempts, itd be the AFP with the guidance of ISAFP. I am pretty confident that the government, by itself, can handle these two issues.

But not People Power.

I am not exactly sure how Leni will transport large hakot crowds from Laguna and Bicol. But if she somehow manages to assemble at least fifty thousand in Manila, then that will be a problem. The government has no way of effectively dispersing the crowd because of their sheer number. The government may also be accused of brutality as soon as it throws the first tear gas canister.

With this said, I call upon those against destabilization to be vigilant. Be on the lookout for any development from now until the end of January. Stay online and active on social media.

Should Leni and the yellow bleeding hearts stage a People Power Revolution, we will be left with no other option but to safeguard our collective political interests.

If Leni stages a People Power, lets stage a bigger People Power.

I still do not know who will lead our counter-protest.

But if no one steps up, Mocha, Sass, and I will.",RJ Nieto,"December 23, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/12/oustduterte-leila-leni-lourdes-loida-lp-people-power-duterte.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#OustDuterte: Daddy D worries about a 1st Quarter Ouster Plot?,"My friend Mocha Uson was kind enough to make me her plus-one when she attended the Malacaang Christmas Party held yesterday, December 20th. She and the Mocha Girls were invited to perform in the event. I went there as Mochas friend and not as ThinkingPinoy, so I took off my TP hat and watched everything from the point of view of an innocent bystander.

Unencumbered by the need to write anything about the event, I was able to observe everything that went on.

The President Arrives
The president arrived a couple of hours into the party, accompanied by his wife Honeylet Avancea and his daughter Kitty, plus the usual horde that is the Presidential Security Group.

As he was walking towards the venue, I noticed something different in him.

I have personally seen the President on many occasions, starting in 2010 when I was still a budding journalist in SunStar Davao. I have also seen him in action in Beijing and in Singapore. Hes usually very accommodating and personable. His penchant for cracking jokes to lighten everyones mood has even gotten him into a bit of trouble [TP:Le-Knee].

This time, however, the usually jovial President was in a pretty bad mood. He wasnt cranky or anything of that sort, but he wasnt as outgoing as he is known to be.

This time, however, I felt like somethings off. Theres something in the back of that old mans mind. Something that pisses him off enough that it actually showed.

The Presidents Speech
His speech contained the usual elements that even I admit are starting to get old. Theres the advocacy for Federalism vis--vis the historical injustices against the Moro People. Theres the human rights issues vis--vis the war on drugs. The whole nine yards.

I have transcribed and subtitled a countless number of his speeches so I my reaction to this particular speech, as it was happening, was, Okay, theres nothing too spicy about this one.

That is, until he ended it with:
I may be ousted like the others but at least, I will assure you, mark my word: it will never be because of corruption. I will be ousted there, I will be forced out, because I was desperate(ly) trying to help and preserve the Filipino People. Thats about it.
He delved on the ouster issue for several minutes, suggesting that there may indeed be a real threat looming in the horizon.

Of course, the president is a very important and very busy man, so its not as if I can just approach him right after the speech and ask, Psst, Daddy D, anyare?

But I have my own Plan B: I consulted with those who are in-the-know.

The Lead
I have managed to gain over 350,000 social media followers in the past year, some of whom happen to be occupying important positions in the government. Specifically, I have become acquainted with top-tier government officials who are more than willing to provide me with leads.

And a lead is what I got, and I got it from two unrelated sources: one is a high-ranking military official (MO), and the other is a high-profile legal counsel (LG).

Both sources told me on separate occasions that an influential religious group (IRG), widely believed to support Duterte, is actually hedging its bets because it wants to protect a member who happens to be drug-linked police general.

MO and LG said IRG also indoctrinated a high-profile Bilibid inmate, whose anger at Sen. Leila De Lima stems her extorting drug money not only to fund her senatorial candidacy but also to fund her lavish lifestyle. This is the same reason why de Lima was able to give Dayan a relatively ostentatious residence.

Both MO and LG independently confirmed to me that its not just Leila: many members of the Liberal Party are on the take.

Now, I am very careful when it comes to analyzing such information because of potential dezinformatsiya, or the tactic of disinformation aimed at undermining the official version of events [NYTimes]. In colloquial Tagalog, the intel community calls it nangunguryente.

However, I have reason to believe that at least one thing is true: that IRG has an interest in the illegal drug trade, as its the common denominator I got from my two sources.

Thats the lead I needed.

Lets start.

First, it starts with the War on Drugs
The War on Drugs is the root cause of LPs bid for Duterte ouster. With the drug war, Duterte stepped on the foot of powerful people and organizations who benefit, whether directly or indirectly, from the illegal drug trade. These includes not only those who trade illegal drugs, but also those who receive the illegal drug largesse.

whose targets may be benefiting powerful institutions
As discussed earlier, Influential Religious Group (IRG) benefits from drug trade, but this kind of news is not really new, as it has been documented before in other countries with serious drug problems.

Narcolimosnas, or the flow of illegal drug profits to religious institutions in the form of charitable donations, is a widespread practice in areas like Mexico, where drug cartels thrive [ElPaso]. But it doesnt end there. Narcolimosnas may actually be used for money laundering, with the US Government itself pleading to the Church to address this issue [Breitbart].
A good example of Narcolimosnas is when Mexican drug lord Javier Torres built a Catholic church in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico [Borderzine].

Sinaloa? Yes, the headquarters of the dreaded Sinaloa Cartel, the same cartel that expanded operations to the Philippines in as early as 2013 [TP: 400 deaths]. And what does any multinational company do when it expands overseas? Adopt best practices from its headquarters.

Does the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines or other major religious groups receive donations from drug lords?

I cannot definitively say for now.

However, the Diocese of Paraaques rabid opposition to the drug war (as evidenced by its morbid outdoor exhibit outside the Baclaran Church [ABS]) despite the lack of relevant evidence showing state-sponsored killings [TP: Destroy Duterte], should raise some suspicion. Moreover, the fact that its head, Bishop Jesse Mercado [CBCP], has an alleged history of swindling disaster relief funds [Catholic], brings that suspicion to a whole new level.

 and the Liberal Party.
I have reason to believe that many Liberal Party (LP) members fall into this category, as evidenced by the late Quezon Governor Rafael Nantes of Quezon, who alleged ran a drug transshipment point in his province [TP: Jesse Robredo]. Nantes was LPs national treasurer during the 2010 Presidential Campaign, where LP bet Benigno Noynoy Aquino won.

Drugs flourished during LPs occupation of Malacaang. Despite the rising drug problem, Aquino never mentioned it in any of his SONA speeches [TP: Aquinos Priorities]. Besides, LPs alleged links with the illegal drug trade is not really news, as I have explained in the July TP article PNP Generals and PH Narcopolitics: Jesse Robredos murder holds key?.

In 2012, Justice Sec. De Lima even issued new rules to immediately release drug suspects while their cases are under automatic review [Star].

A willful ignorance of the drug problem and preferential treatment for drug offenders: this best describes the Aquino Presidencys stance on illegal drugs. And did I mention that Ozamis politician-druglords  the Parojinogs  are connected not only to the Liberal Party [Star] but also to the illegal drug trade [Inq]?


No wonder Sen. Grace Poe recently demanded that Sen. De Lima (LP) explain why drugs flourished during the latters DOJ stint [GMA].

Its also interesting to note that todays Commission on Human Rights Chair Chito Gascon was LPs Director-General from 2009 to 2011. According to his LinkedIn Profile, he was running [the] day to day affairs of his party [LinkedIn].

Gascon has to be monumentally imbecilic if he didnt know that his own treasurer could be a drug lord.

But in spite of my disgust for Gascon, I would still concede that he is far from stupid.

And lets just be honest here: Dutertes pro-poor policies have been torturing the Liberal Party since Day One [TP: Chef Duterte].

Dutertes Ouster
On 17 September 2016, while he was turning over the latest still-undisclosed narco-list to the AFP , he said:
Ibigay ko ito sa Armed Forces. Ito ang problema natin... I'm just saying that the ultimate warriors of the Constitution, to protect the people is the Armed Forces of the Philippines. So bahala na kayo If it would outlast me, mawala ako nang bigla, hingin ko lang sa inyo to see to it that this country will not take a spin [GMA].
[TRANSLATION: I am giving this (list) to the Armed Forces. This is our problem I'm just saying that the ultimate warriors of the Constitution, to protect the people is the Armed Forces of the Philippines. So I leave it to you if it would outlast me, if I suddenly pass away, see to it that this country will not take a spin.]

Duterte said this in front of the AFP. He never said this in front of VP Leni Robredo of the Liberal Party, the woman who would take over his position should he prematurely lose the presidency.


Yes, it appears that Duterte finds a post-Duterte military junta more tolerable than another Liberal Party Presidency.

I guess we have a pretty good idea why.

Previous Ouster Attempts
Suffice it to say, Dutertes War against Drugs is against the oppositionist Liberal Partys interests and possibly, also those who indirectly benefit from the drug trade. And Dutertes unwaivering anti-drug stance forces his opponents to fight tooth and nail to kick him out of Malacaang. Well, the oppositions ouster plots are already a given: they have been at it since the old man won in May 2016:

First, there was Plan B, which Duterte thwarted through Mark Villars appointment [TP: Villar].

Second, there was Plan ICC, which was made unlikely because of ICCs weakening per the withdrawal of South Africa [NPR], potentially followed by a mass withdrawal of other African states [NewsWeek].

Third, there was US intervention , which was made unlikely because Loida Nicolas-Lewis LP-leaning US-Philippine Society is too closely connected to Hillary Clinton who, in turn, lost the November elections [TP: Trump].

And just when I thought that LP has ran out of tricks up their sleeve, here they go again with yet another plan, a plan that may actually work if we, the Filipino People, do nothing.

Dutertes 2017 Ouster: Leila, Leni, Lourdes, Loida, and the Liberal Party

But first, lets talk about what this new plan could be, a plan that I shall call Plan Q1 2017.

Theres nothing special about this name, except for the indication that whatever that plan is, it should be put into effect in the First Quarter of 2017 for reasons that I shall disclose later in the article.

Plan Q1 2017 has five main players and they are:

FIRST, LEILA
Sen. Leila de Lima who serves as the lightning rod and whose pronouncements against alleged extrajudicial killings sparked international outrage that would make Dutertes ouster more palatable for the international community.

SECOND, LP
The Liberal Party hierarchy provides the basic political machinery. LP can take care of all the ancillary support mechanisms during the ouster attempts, including grassroots mobilization.

THIRD, LOIDA
Billionaire Filipino-American Loida Nicolas-Lewis can provide the financial resources necessary to stage such a power grab. With a net worth of over $600 million [MorningNewsUSA],  1 billion ($20 million) should be a drop in the bucket for this woman and Duterte himself accused her of plotting to overthrow him [BW]

FOURTH, LOURDES
Supreme Court Chief Justice Lourdes Sereno, an Aquino appointee, can provide time by unilaterally delaying the progress of Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos electoral protest case, something that may actually be happening right now. More on this on the next article

FIFTH, LENI
In the event of an ouster via People Power, VP Leni Robredo can legally serve as Dutertes replacement, in light of the Supreme Court decision on Estrada v. Desierto [GR 146710-15] and/or Lawyers' League v. Aquino [GR 73748], where the High Court essentially recognized People Power as a legitimate method for removing a sitting president.

Now that we have the ingredients, its time to talk about the recipe. That is, let me explain to you how it exactly works.

How would these main players interact? How will they effect an overthrow?

Lets talk about that in the next article to be released later tonight.

PH Crime Rate drops significantly: PNP,"""The Philippines is now safer from theft, carnapping, robbery, physical injury, and rape.""

This is the statement of Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar as the Philippine National Police (PNP) released figures showing index crime volume declined 25,673 to 55,391 in July-November 2016 period, from 81,064 a year ago.

Citing the said PNP report, Andanar said index crime rate went down to 31.67 percent in July to November this year as compared to the same period last year.
Index crimes are defined by the PNP as crimes against persons (such as murder, homicide, physical injury, and rape) and crimes against property (like robbery, theft, carnapping, and cattle rustling). 
Data showed crimes against property posted a significant slide to 42.48 percent, while crimes against person dropped 12.25 percent.

Overall, crime incidents continued to decline across the country since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office.

PNP report showed crime volume had gone down 34,741 (12.44%) to 244,637 in July-November 2016 period as against 279,378 in the same period last year.

Secretary Andanar lauded the efforts of the PNP in fulfilling the election promise of President Duterte to solve rampant criminality.


""I am calling on the people to continue cooperating with the police to further bring down crime incidents in the country,"" the Presidential Communications chief added.

"SOCEs and SALNs: Just how clueless, bookish, and lazy is PCIJ?","If there's one thing that can describe PCIJ's latest SOCE-themed article series, it would be ""KABISOTE"".

I always try my best to make Politics funny and interesting for my readers, because politics and its periphery are an inherently very toxic subject matter and talking about it has taken a toll on me. So after a year of almost nonstop ThinkingPinoy, I decided to take a short vacation in Davao City. But just a few hours after landing in Durianland, I discovered that controversy after controversy erupted in Manila and I was like, ""Heto na naman tayo! (Here we go again!)"".

Among these burning controversies are a series of articles released by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), controversial mainly because  the articles tackle election spending and  PCIJ has a reputation for in-depth investigative reports. And yes, I checked the PCIJ articles one by one, hoping to find something interesting. And yes, I found a few interesting bits, but theyre interesting for all the wrong reasons.

Lets discuss the PCIJ articles one by one and to make this blog post easier to follow, let me first list down the articles-in-question.
THE WINDFALL OF ELECTIONS: 13 bets, 4 parties raise P69-M excess donations
PUZZLING PERSONAL SPENDERS: SALNs and SOCEs of some bets dont add up
CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND THE 2016 ELECTIONS: Donors, Inc.: Only 830 Filipinos bankrolled poll bid of 5 prez bets
CAMPAIGN FINANCE OFFICE IN DRIFT, HEADLESS: P334M from only 13 donors funded Dutertes presidency
Now, let's go.

Article 1: Excess Donations
In THE WINDFALL OF ELECTIONS: 13 bets, 4 parties raise P69-M excess donations, PCIJ investigated what the candidates for national-level positions did with their excess campaign contributions based on their respective Statements of Campaign Expenditures (SOCEs).

I was a bit iffy about this article from the onset because SOCEs are historically under-reported [Vera]. That is, a candidate who reports campaign expenses should fall under one of the following categories:
1. The candidate is incredibly stupid
2. The candidate is incredibly honest
3. The amount is incredibly negligible
Losing senatorial candidate Isko Moreno reported an excess of P50 million (P171-m contributions minus P121-m expenses). Comparing his expenses with Franklin Drilons P144-m and Hontiveros P99-m, I have a reason to believe that he did not deliberately underspend. As to where the P50 million went is anybodys guess, and I feel that PCIJ is correct when they decided to raise their eyebrows when they received this information. Thus, Moreno is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly honest, or both.
Whats confusing for me, however, is their inclusion of other candidates in the same article, as all other candidates reported an excess of less than P5 million which, for a national-level campaign, wouldnt really get any candidate anywhere. That is, their excess contributions fall under the third category, i.e. incredibly negligible.

Minus Iskos P50-million, theres really nothing interesting here. It appears that PCIJ simply tried to stretch the article so itd pass as a feature piece. I found it thoroughly disappointing, as I had higher expectations in an article from a purportedly distinguished institution.

Si Isko Moreno lang ang problema tapos nandamay pa ng iba, para lang mapahaba ang article!

Its also worthy to note that PCIJ said it tried to contact the candidates and parties who had reported unspent amounts to find out what they did with the money One of those who has yet to reply is President Duterte...

According to PCIJs data set, Duterte reported P3.5 million in excess campaign donations. In theory, excess donations should be declared as income, so I guess thats why PCIJ examined Dutertes 2016 SALN, which shows an P500,000 increase, or P3 million short of the expected amount.

However, a simple Google search with the keywords Duterte Excess Donation [Goog] leads to a May 2016 [Philstar] report indicating that Duterte returned the unused sums to the donors, which the newspaper said was the first time excess funds were returned to contributors.

Surely, the supposedly prestigious organization could have pointed that out. But it didnt.

Alam na ng taong sinauli na ni Duterte ang pera... maliban sa mga taga-PCIJ.

Article 2: SALNs vs SOCEs
The article PUZZLING PERSONAL SPENDERS: SALNs and SOCEs of some bets dont add up really puzzled me.

Aside from Roxas and Marcos, whose out-of-pocket expenses are P18 million and P9.8 million respectively, the other presidential and vice-presidential expenses shelled out negligible amounts (less than P1 million) from their personal coffers, but PCIJ still decided to include other candidates in the chart.

I dont know if its just me, but whats more puzzling is the fact that Leni was not on the table.
Sure, Leni could have claimed that she spent none of her own money for the campaign, but would anyone buy that excuse? Seriously, not even a single peso?

And do you still remember when she said, ""Very creative nga 'yung aking mga volunteer. Kung anu-ano 'yung naiisipan. 'Yung fundraining dinner na for me, siguro mahigit lima at malaki talaga 'yung nakukuha sa mga fundraising dinners.?

Ain't that neat?  Too neat?

Would it have been wiser for PCIJ to explore Robredos case, considering that the P418 million she spent dwarfs winning presidential candidate Dutertes 371 million, despite the fact that she is just running for VP?

May pilit bang sinusunod na SOCE theme ang PCIJ kaya kahit mas mahalagang anggulo e dinedma na lang nila... Or was there a directive from higher-ups to avoid mentioning anything too negative about her?

ARTICLE 3: Only 830 Filipino Bankrollers
In CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND THE 2016 ELECTIONS: Donors, Inc.: Only 830 Filipinos bankrolled poll bid of 5 prez bets, PCIJ explained that a woefully small number of Filipinos funded the vast majority of presidential campaigns. I actually concede to that, and I myself am disturbed by this fact.

PCIJ suggested that a candidate who relies too much on the contribution of too few is a captured candidate, which means he or she is more likely to be beholden to the interest of his or her small group of wealthy benefactors.

Even I agree with that, especially in light of the public knowledge that Grace Poe enjoyed the blessings of Marcos crony Danding Cojuangco [TP: Coco Levy], a major figure in Poes social circle [TP: Connection].
PCIJ then went on to list the biggest contributors of each major presidential candidate, then it quickly analyzed the numbers without regard to the nuances of each of their campaigns.

For such an organization, this is disappointing, to say the least. To say that there are only 830 Filipino Bankrollers based solely on the SOCEs is lazy journalism. SALNs cover only the campaign period that started a few weeks after the dawn of 2016. However, actual big-ticket spending started way before that.


Tingnan mo lang si Roxas, Binay, at Poe: hindi pa kampanyahan, nakaubos na ng pinagsamang P2 billion!


Take TV, radio, and newspaper ad spending in 2015 as an example, where Mar Roxas spent P774 million, Binay P695 million, Poe P694 million, and Duterte P129 million [MT]. Heres a table that neatly compares the said figures vs SOCE (campaign period) spending:



Looking at this table, would it be reasonable to say that only 830 bankrolled the candidates when a vast majority of the big spenders spent the vast majority of their funds before the campaign period even started, i.e. before the period that SOCEs cover?

PCIJ is mostly technically correct when it said only 830 bankrolled the candidates during the campaign period, but how useful is that information when the fact of the matter is a vast chunk of total election-related spending are not included in the SOCEs anyway?

Cayetanos P71-m
Moreover, its interesting that VP candidate Cayetano was cited as having donated P71 million which PCIJ called substantial. PCIJ described the donation as in the form of tandem advertisements.

Here's one of those ""tandem ads""

PCIJ conveniently failed to define ""tandem ads"" as Duterte being mentioned in Cayetano political ads. This would not have made much of an issue if not for the fact that PCIJ essentially insinuates that Duterte hitching on Cayetano pol ads makes Duterte more likely to turn into a captured candidate.


This theory is problematic at best as the Cayetano camp would probably agree that its Cayetano who needs Dutertes endorsement more than the other way around. That is, while Cayetano had the money, it was Duterte who had the star power. I voted for Cayetano, and I am very well aware of that fact.



Totohanang usapan lang ha: utang na loob ba ni Duterte na lumitaw sa commercial ni Cayetano, o kailangan talaga ni Cayetano na ma-endorse ni Duterte?

So would that P71 million really make Duterte beholden to Cayetano? I do not think so because that wouldve implied that the Marcos Burial wouldnt have happened [TP: Cancel Burial], as Cayetano is against the Marcoses [CNN].

I think PCIJ, with its resources and connections, has been very lazy lately.

Independent Micro-contributions
PCIJ said contributions amounting to P10,000 and below reached a total of only P175,313, which is not even half of one percent of his campaign funds. But why didnt PCIJ even attempt to estimate de facto micro-donations that were integral in the Duterte Campaign but cannot be directly measured?

This issue becomes even more noticeable in light of the other PCIJ article CAMPAIGN FINANCE OFFICE IN DRIFT, HEADLESS: P334M from only 13 donors funded Dutertes presidency

For one, PCIJ failed to take into account the countless number of Duterte shirts printed by volunteers who are not officially connected to the Duterte campaign [MS]? With a modest estimate of 1000 plain shirts per province times a production cost of P200 per shirt times 81 provinces, that would already amount to P16 million nationwide!

During the elections, regular citizens took the initiative to campaign for Duterte. PCIJ failed to take that into account.
And we're just talking about the T-shirts: we have not even included the Duterte ballers, the tarpaulins, and the costs of independent pro-Duterte grassroots groups.

This is my point: PCIJ unnecessarily limited campaign spending into whats in the SOCE. However, in light of the Dutertes unorthodox campaign, old definitions dont apply anymore.

Has PCIJ been left behind by the times?

What is TPs point?
PCIJ should take every effort to make sure that their articles describe reality as accurately as possible. However, judging from the gaping holes in this PCIJ SOCE series, it appears that PCIJ, who once had a reputation of engaging in out-of-the-box journalism, has become as dangerously bookish as the rest of traditional media.

Is the PCIJs SOCE series still useful in evaluating the status quo of Philippine elections?

#MarcosBurialProtest: LSU-Ozamis School Admin unwittingly makes a fool of himself?,"An LSU-Ozamis school administrator makes a fool of himself in the most dazzling manner possible.



On 28 November 2016, La Salle University  Ozamiz City (LSU-Ozamiz) issued a memo to its students, faculty, and staff. I re-type the memo and its as follows:


La Salle University

Ozamiz City

Urgent Actions on the Advocacy for Human Rights

We received a letter from our Auxiliary Visitor, Br. Jose Mari Jimenez FSC, in line with De La Salle Philippines call to take a heroic stance and proclaim our commitment to build a nation that protects human rights.

In line with this, DLSP member schools are to implement the DLSP-Network Programs for Sustaining the advocacy for human rights.

All LSU students, faculty and staff ARE TO WEAR BLACK (tops) every Tuesday, starting tomorrow, November 29th, 2016 until March 2017, to show solidarity with the victims of EJK and Martial Law.

Approved:
(SGD) Ms. Charm Femae L. Mendoza, RGC
Vice-chancellor for Lasallian Mission
The letter was okay, except for the last paragraph.

After discovering this letter, I wrote a 29 November 2016 post addressed to LSU-Ozamiz:

Dear La Salle University- Ozamiz City,

Forcing your students, faculty, and staff to wear black for such a cause is tantamount to usurping their political right to have their own opinion, which goes totally contrary to your purported aim of protecting human rights.

I also find it disconcerting that such a directive comes from a school that's right smack in the middle of the city where Bilibid drug lord Herbert Colanggo -- through his extended family, the Parojinogs -- lorded over (http://bit.ly/2gGYTml).

The actions suggested in the letter would have made a greater impact if your zeal for human rights also applied to those that your druggist local politicians victimized.

Too bad it isn't.

Lovingly Yours,
TP
I further discovered the same memo is published on the schools official website [LSU].
LSU-Ozamiz presumably missed (or ignored) my November 29th post because a day later, its Facebook administrator posted a status message that reads [FB]:

Come to think of it.. (sic) We aren't doing anything different, teaching anything different.

People put their children in La Salle because they want us to help them to teach their children to be grateful for what God has given them, to think critically and outside the box, to question the status quo when needed, to treat people kindly and respectfully and to fight for truth and the sanctity of life.

That's the very reason why we're wearing black.

That's why we're on the streets.

If you believe that education should not be about truth, justice, kindness and respect, maybe we're not the right school for you.

#MarcosNotAHero
#LiveLoveLaSalle
To which, I replied [FB]:
Dear La Salle University- Ozamiz City,

Unless you have your own version of English, saying that your students, faculty, and staff ""are to wear black"" in line with the #MarcosBurialProtest means they are REQUIRED to wear black.

Contrary to your aim of helping your students ""think critically and outside the box"", the directive actually forces them to be subservient to authority out of fear of being admonished for having political beliefs that may be incongruent to that of the school administration.

You're lucky because the Anti-discrimination Bill did not pass in the 16th Congress, but ""Nulla poena sine lege"" doesn't mean it's all good.

When educators believe that they have a monopoly on the truth is the same time an education institution fails its mandate to educate.


I disagree with your claim that you are not doing anything differently.

Many students from De La Salle University - Taft and De La Salle Santiago Zobel School did wear black, but the school only ""REQUESTED"" them to do so. They did not force their students to do their bidding, unlike what you did to yours. These two sister schools of yours respected their students' right to their own beliefs, something that you failed to do to yours.

Now, if you actually meant ""are requested to wear"" when you said ""are to wear"", then maybe that school really isn't the right one for anyone, especially those who want to learn English.

Lovingly Yours,
TP

Today is 02 December 2016, and LSU-Ozamiz has yet to issue a statement regarding the matter.

Things get interesting
But heres the fun part. A certain Facebook user named Jarjar Binks issued an ad hominem-riddled rebuttal to my statement. Well, its not a rebuttal per se, because he did not address any of the core issue raised in my letter.  Instead, he fixated on the line:

You're lucky because the Anti-discrimination Bill did not pass in the 16th Congress, but ""Nulla poena sine lege"" doesn't mean it's all good.

I have a self-imposed policy of not attacking private persons on my Facebook wall (I try my best), but a closer look at Jarjar Binks profile shows that his Facebook URL is https://www.facebook.com/noel.alamin.

But as it turns out, ""Noel Alamin"" is LSU-Ozamiz Political Science Program Head, who also happens to possess a law degree [LSU].


Yes, Jarjar Binks a.k.a. Noel Alamin is an LSU-Ozamis school administrator.

Alright, I wont spare this idiot. THIS WILL BE FUN.

LSU-Ozamiz Prof. Noel Alamin's Rebuttal 
Now, heres the pseudo-rebuttal he wrote [FB]:

Dear La Salle University - Ozamiz,

Kindly ask (un)Thinking Pinoy what Anti Discrimination Bill he/she was referring to when he blabbered in his/her FB page that LSU-Ozamis is lucky the Anti Discrimination Bill did not pass during the 16th Congress. And if it is not too much to ask kindly tell him also to cite the particular provision of the bill which would have penalized Lasalle had it been passed into a law.

Did TP mean the Anti Discrimination Bill on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity or Expression (Sogie)? The Anti Discrimination against Ethnicity? The Anti-Age Discrimination Bill was passed into law May of this year so that`s out of the equation. (un)Thinking Pinoy can`t also be referring to the Comprehensive Anti Discrimination Act of 2016 because it was filed during the 17th Congress, specifically on August 1,2016 and already with the 17th Congress.

So, unless TP thinks that your memo to ur staff and students to wear black is discriminatory against (ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation in which case anyone with half a brain will know otherwise) then there really is no reason for you to stress over comments coming from a troll account who filters inquiry which would expose his idiocy!

I am asking you this because i took the pains of waving my magic wand to make him answer the above mentioned question given my very limited knowledge of law. Pero waley,denelete nya comment ko ng bongang bonga! Muntikan na akong ma intimidate sa latin maxim ni TP to wit: ""Nulla Poena Sine Lege""un pala for show lang ang iklavosh!

Hui Thinking Pinoy, don`t me nga!

Lovingly yours,

Jarjar Binks

Oooh, I'm excited!!!



LSU-Ozamiz Prof. Noel Alamin's ""Points""
Lets list the issues in his letter one by one.

 Which Anti-Discrimination Bill I was talking about.
 Which part of that bill is relevant to LSU-Ozamiz dress code issue.
 On whether ""nulla poena sine lege"" is just a filler.
 On whether I deleted his comment or not.

Now, let me address those issues one by one.  

Oh dear. Hindi lang pala English ang issue ng LSU-Ozamis, pati Political Science din yata.


First, which Anti-Discrimination Bill
Alamin asked what Anti-discrimination Bill I was referring to. He further attempted to be cute by attacking strawmen when he mentioned the Anti-Discrimination Bill on the Basis of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity or Expression (SOGIE) filed by Senators Hontiveros and Villanueva on 01 August 2016 [Senate]. He also mentioned other bills which are totally irrelevant to political persecution, but I think Ive already made this point clear.

LSU-Ozamis' own PolSci head doesn't know what went on in the Senate

Professor Alamin, the Anti-Discrimination Bill in question is the Anti-Discrimination Act of 2014 [SB 2122] penned by Sen. Bam Aquino and filed on 12 February 2014, or during the 16th Congress [Senate].

The full title of the bill reads:
AN ACT PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF ETHNICITY, RACE, RELIGION OR BELIEF, POLITICAL INCLINATION, SOCIAL CLASS, SEX, GENDER, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, GENDER IDENTITY, GENDER EXPRESSION, CIVIL STATUS, HIV STATUS AND OTHER MEDICAL CONDITION AND PROVIDING PENALTIES THEREFOR
Yes, theres a part there that says POLITICAL INCLINATION.


Political Science Professor Noel Alamin, your ignorance of political events is not my problem, but when your ignorance affects the youth, thats another story.

Second, the relevant provisions
Given your ignorance of things that you should be familiar with as a law degree holder and as an LSU-Ozamis Political Science Professor, I think its safe to say that you still need a bit of spoonfeeding, so let me do that.

SB 2122 Section 2 states:
Political inclination refers to a person's preference with regards to membership or belief in a particular political party, organization or ideology.
Now, Section 4 states:
Discrimination that is indirectly or directly based on the actual or perceived political inclination is prohibited.
Now, Section 5(b) states:
It shall be unlawful to deny a person enjoyment of political rights based on the grounds referred to Section 4.
At this point, I hope that your brain can already connect the dots. However, because of my reservations about your competence as an educator, let me spell it out for you:

Through its policy of a mandatory anti-Marcos burial dress code, LSU-Ozamiz denies its faculty, students and staff their right to choose their political ideology. This policy infringes on the rights of those who do not (or have decided to cease to) give a shit about the burial, let alone those who may be Pro-Marcos.
If you, LSU-Ozamis Political Science Professor Noel Alamin, needs more spoonfeeding, just let me know.


Nietzsche once wrote, ""He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.""

I have reservations about your ability to digest that line, so let me water it down a bit:


Mr. Alamin, you do not fight a dictator by being a dictator yourself.



Third, on ""Nulla poena sine lege""
Aquinos SB 2122 didnt pass in the 16th Congress, LSU-Ozamis cannot be punished for issuing a directive that violates it, in accordance with Nulla poena sine lege (Latin,No penalty without a law), which is a basic legal doctrine saying one cannot be punished for something that is not prohibited by law [Dana 2009].

And that is exactly why I said LSU-Ozamiz is lucky because the Anti-discrimination Bill did not pass in the 16th Congress, but ""Nulla poena sine lege"" doesn't mean it's all good. That is, just because a law against an act wasnt enacted doesnt mean violations of the law are alright.

The Philippine-made ILOVEYOU virus caused over US$8.7 billion in damages worldwide [Gazeta Edukacja]. However, there was no Philippine Law at the time covering this particular type of cybercrime, so the Justice Department dropped charges against programmer Onel de Guzman [NYTimes].

Yes, de Guzman couldnt be sued, but creating the virus is not ok.

At kung hindi mo pa rin gets, let me restate the point: 
Yes, LSU-Ozamiz cannot be sued for violating SB 2122, but dictating political beliefs on students is not ok. 

Fourth, on whether I deleted your comment
You further accused me of deleting your comment sans proof that you actually posted one on the Thinking Pinoy Facebook Page. Note, however, that I cannot discount the possibility that your comment triggered my pages automatic profanity filter, given your penchant for ad hominem attacks.

However, even if you indeed posted a comment as insipid as the one you posted on your own facebook wall, I am pretty confident that I will not delete it, because I like to be amused once in a while.


A thoroughly vapid comment written by an LSU-Ozamiz administrator in defense of LSU-Ozamis Policy? Why the hell would I let that pass? It's comedy gold!

Mr. Noel Alamin, you are the head of LSU-Ozamiz Political Science Department, and you also have a law degree. With those kinds of credentials come several expectations, expectations that you failed to meet, in light of your Facebook post-slash-rant.

Note that I have meticulously used the term law degree instead of Attorney or Lawyer, and by this point, I think that you already know why.

Now lets recall what I said in my letter to LSU-Ozamis, I said that ...if [LSU-Ozamiz] actually meant ""are requested to wear"" when [it] said ""are to wear"", then maybe that school really isn't the right one for anyone, especially those who want to learn English.

Let me add a little bit to that.

I guess LSU-Ozamiz also happens to be the wrong school for Political Science.

Oh, and for the love of all thats good and holy, PLEASE DO NOT OPEN A LAW SCHOOL.

Now, in case you still dont get it, let me spell it out for you:

Dear LSU-Ozamiz PolSci Dep't Head Noel Alamin, Ll.B., MPS,

Please do not let your ego write checks that your brain cant encash.

Lovingly Yours,

TP

"[GOOD NEWS] FoI Launched! It's payback time: now, ANYBODY can investigate corruption","When I wrote [TP: Oplan Lambat-Sibat: PNP admits doctored crime stats], I showed how the Aquino-era police force fudges crime statistics to make it look our streets are safer, despite the contrary. In the last part of the article, I lamented, To verify Oplan Lambat-Sibats scientific reports, we need raw, unadulterated data that cover months worth of crime reports. Perhaps, thats something that only (Former DILG Sec.) Mar Roxas knows.

Since god-knows-when, secrecy and inaccessibility of government information has been a source of frustration for investigative bloggers like me. So just imagine my delight when then-Camarines Sur Rep. Leni Robredo filed a powerful Freedom of Information Bill, which would afford any citizen access to government records. Unfortunately, fortitude is not one of Lenis virtues, as she [TP: crippled her own bill to satisfy her Liberal Party overlords], led by then-President Benigno Noynoy Aquino.

With Freedom of Information (FoI), regular citizens can request for government documents, allowing them to learn more deeply about how the government works. Unfortunately, FoI has been stuck in the legislature since time immemorial, and despite President Rodrigo Dutertes May 2016 win, the best he can do is certify the bill as urgent, but the buck stops at the Senate and the Lower House.

But that didnt stop the current administration to finding a way to get around it.


Dutertes Workaround
Duterte, being the Dyosa of Finding Ways to Move Forward, managed to get around this legislative issue. As Chief Executive, he issued Executive Order No. 2 [EO 2 s. 2016], which is basically a Freedom of Information Law that covers the entire Executive Branch.

Per EO 2 Section 3:
Access to Information. Every Filipino shall have access to information, official records, public records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development.
Note, however, that EO 2 is not absolute, as it comes with several exceptions, per EO 2 Section 4. These exceptions usually affect documents whose public release will affect national security, or the effectiveness of government policy, among others.Duterte issued EO 2 in the first month of his presidency, and compiling the exceptions took a few months. Fair enough, I said, so I waited.

But the (relatively) long wait is over!

FoI Launched
In a formal ceremony held yesterday, Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Sec. Martin Andanar finally launched the Freedom of Information Portal, called eFoI, which makes it easier for regular citizens like us to access government information.
OFFTOPIC 1: I was actually invited to attend the event but I was too exhausted with TP-related stuff, so I asked PCOO to send me a copy of Andanars speech plus the reading materials they gave away during the event.

Andanar said, Power always has to be kept in check; power exercised in secret, is doubly dangerous. The Freedom of Information is the key to a balance of power between the government and its citizens.
While the Executive FoI is limited to the executive branch, Andanar noted that the Legislature is already working on it.

Andanar said, The Senate has passed the FoI at the 17th Congress The House of Representatives (is now conducting) committee hearings... We look towards a day where the Freedom of Information will be an Act and not just an Executive Order..
OFFTOPIC 2: And by the way, I also heard rumors that traditional media outfits ranting because they werent invited and I told myself, Buti nga sa kanila! (Serves them right!). The entire ceremony was livestreamed anyway, so why would they need to be there? Its not like the ceremony in itself is controversial. Their rant stems not from not being invited: it stems from their bruised bloated egos.

How to use FoI
The old-school way of using FoI is messy because it involves paperwork. With eFoI, however, we can invoke FoI and request documents online.

STEP 1: Create an eFOI Account
This is not very different from creating an email account, except that youll be required to a upload a proof of identification. A photo of any government-issued ID will do.


STEP 2: Click Make a Request
Youll be asked to select an agency that will respond your FoI request. Currently, there are 15 agencies to choose from but this list will be expanded. If the desired agency is unavailable and you cant wait, you can file a paper-based FoI request at the PCOO office in the New Executive Building within the Malacanang Compound (Gate 2).


STEP 3: Fill in details.
Youll be asked for the Title of Document, Coverage or Time period, Intended Purpose, and an optional Personal Message:
""Title of Document"" doesnt have to be very exact, but it should be descriptive enough to allow the agency to understand what exactly youre looking for.
""Coverage or Time Period"" refers to the dates covered by the document requested.
""Intended Purpose"" can simply be Research or if you want to be more specific, feel free to write whatever you want.
""Personal Message"" may be instructions or additional information that can help the agency process your request more quickly.
STEP 4: Wait for a Reply
All replies shall be sent fifteen  working days after the receipt of the request. The agency will be sending a response, informing of an extension of processing period no longer than twenty  working days, should the need arise [FoI Manual]. For eFoI requests (online requests), the government will reply via email.

Duterte requires executive agencies to comply with FoI requests. Violators will be suspended on the 2nd offense, dismissed on the 3rd [FoI Manual]. Moreover, Duterte also ordered that there shall be a legal presumption in favor of access to information, so it is the government agencys responsibility to prove that you are not entitled to the requested data, as opposed to you having to prove that you are entitled to it [EO 2 s. 2016, Sec 7].

STEP 5: Get Data
After approval, the government will give you a link that leads to the information you requested. You can share the link, including the document, to anyone. Isnt that neat?!

With that said, I think its important that you check pending requests before sending a request of your own, because we do not want the government to get swamped with multiple requests for the same thing, as one approved request is enough for everyone to access the same piece information.


You can check the list of pending, approved and denied requests at the Requests Tab of the eFoI site.

What specific documents can I request?
Oh, heres where things get REALLY pretty! Here are some examples where FoI can be used.

First, on the DAP Controversy
You can request for the cash releases made under the Aquino administrations unconstitutional Disbursement Acceleration Program.

From what I know, Aquino signed almost 2,000 Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) [MT] so we cant really expect the government to give us each one of them. However, we can simply ask for an MS Excel file listing each SAROs control number, beneficiary, purpose, date of release, etc. Afterwards, you can send a supplementary request for specific SAROs that looks particularly fishy.

Second, the Mamasapano Massacre
You can also request for the release of records of conversations that ensued during the Mamasapano massacre. I am not sure of the government will grant such a request as it may fall under the exceptions, but it is worth a try. This way, we can get a better idea of how PNoy exactly bungled the operation that led to the deaths of 44 policemen.

Third, the Kidapawan Carnage
Remember 01 April 2016 when the government opened fire on starving farmers in [TP: Kidapawan]? I plan to use the eFoI portal to access not only the Department of Agriculture documents related to the bungled El Nio efforts, but also the Presidents itinerary for the week immediately following that fateful day. I want to understand why Noynoy failed to immediately issue a statement, i.e. why Noynoy Noynoy-ed. I will also want to know why the PNP awarded the policemen involved in the incident, despite the incident still being under investigation.

Ah! My heart is racing! I cannnnnot!

These are just some three of the potential applications of the new eFoI portal.

Oh, wait! We can also request for NBIs records during Matobatos stay in the Witness Protection Program. Lets see what he told the NBI back then, then compare his statements what he said during the recent Senate Hearings. Wouldnt that be awesome?

Oh, and the Yolanda Funds. Oh my god, I cant breathe with all this excitement!

Do you have a particular issue that you want to investigate? Leave a comment on my Facebook Page at Facebook.com/TheThinkingPinoy!You can also check the FoI portal at Foi.gov.ph!

RH Law and Garins Implanon: Did DoH waste 200 million?,"I am categorically pro-RH, but I think its time to re-evaluate government policy because the only way to move forward is to actually move forward.

Ha? Ano raw? Ill explain.

Its time to understand the current situation and see what we can do to fix it.

(FEATURE IMAGE: A woman holding the controversial contraceptive Implanon. Image courtesy of the Valenzuela City Government.)

Lets face it: a 30,000-peso monthly paycheck is barely enough for a family of five. Now, imagine if the breadwinner earns a half of that and the family is twice as big? Sadly, thats the case of many Filipinos today because of limited access to birth control products, and the RH Law was enacted for this purpose.

If theres one thing that I can give the Aquino Administration some credit for, it would be the passage of the Reproductive Health (RH) Law, more formally known as the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 [RA 10354].

The problem, however, is that as of today, its still nowhere near implementation because of legal roadblocks.

What the Supreme Court did
On 13 March 2013, the SC prohibited the RH Laws implementation pending the judicial review. It was extended until the SC decided parts of it were unconstitutional. These parts were struck down [GMA].

And just when I thought it has been ironed out after that, another challenge popped up in June 2014, when a civil society organization challenged the constitutionality of the Department of Healths decision to distribute contraceptive implants that can prevent pregnancies for up to three years. The SC TRO-ed the RH Law again [GMA].

The battle still rages two years later, well into the Duterte Presidency.

The contraceptives-in-question are Implanon and Implanon NXT, which we will collectively call Implanon because theyre essentially the same thing.

I'll describe the current situation then explain what we can do to fix it.

The Supreme Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) that prevents [SC 2nd Div]:
DoH from issuing new registrations and recertifications of all RH products.
DoH from having anything to do with Implanon.

Note that the TRO I used as reference [SC 2nd Div] was issued on June 2015, but its basically the same TRO thats being rehashed from 2014 to present.

Oo, two years and at least four million new Filipinos later, pinag-aawayan pa rin.

What can we do?
Judging from the TROs contents, there are two core issues:
The constitutionality of all RH products
The constitutionality of Implanon
Obviously, the key to overcoming this hurdle is showing that the two are constitutional.
THE FIRST ISSUE, the constitutionality of all RH products, is relatively easy to argue. That is, the Philippine SC has cited Griswold vs Connecticut [PBS] in a few decisions, including Gamboa vs PNP, and Ople vs CoA. This suggest that they generally agree to it. Griswold vs Connecticut.

Griswold vs Connecticut is a United States SC decision which says that despite the presumed unconstitutionality of contraceptives, a couples right to marital privacy is more important so the government cannot deny them access to contraceptives.

Basically, Griswold vs Connecticut explains our right na hindi pakialaman ng gobyerno.

This leaves us with the second issue: the constitutionality of Implanon.

What is Implanon?
Late into Aquinos term, Health Sec. Janet Garin announced that her department will procure hundreds of thousands  if not millions  of Implanon for distribution throughout the country.

A single Implanon shot, good for three years, is worth ~$800 [Drugs] or ~40,000 [Goog]. Garin got it for just 500 apiece, thanks to a subsidy from the Gates Foundation [ABS].

Garin has procured 400,000 units so far, worth 200-m. However, due to the June 2014 SC prohibition thats active up to this day, these contraceptives are basically rotting in Department of Health (DoH) warehouses. If the TRO is not lifted before 2018, 200-m of taxpayers money will just go to dust [ABS].

Medyo malabo kasi nga talaga yung Implanon. Tarat ipapaliwanag ko mga friendships.

Implanon is a contraceptive, i.e. an RH product, so if we can win on the first issue using Griswold vs Connecticut, then that would also apply to Implanon, right?
Not exactly. [Article II Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution] specifically says:
The State shall protect the life of the unborn from conception.
The keyword here is CONCEPTION, i.e. the beginning of life.

The problem? RH opponents argue that Implanon is an abortifacient, or an abortion-inducing product.

What exactly is Implanon?
Implanon is a matchstick-shaped device that contains a pregnancy-preventing hormone. It is implanted beneath the skin of the upper arm, and it successfully prevents pregnancies for around three years [UWisc]. It is an extremely effective birth control method, arguably safer and more effective than natural (e.g. rhythm, calendar) or mechanical (condoms, IUDs) methods.

Upon subdermal insertion, Implanon has three effects on a womans body:
Drastically decreases likelihood of ovulation, i.e. virtually no egg cells made
Thickens cervical mucus, i.e. makes sperm less likely to reach egg
Changes the uterine lining. i.e. makes it harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus
And heres where the constitution gets in the way. Do you still remember the keyword I mentioned before?
Conception, or the beginning of life.
Egg cells and sperms cells, on their own, are not human beings per se because otherwise, thatd mean any man who has masturbated at least once in his life would be liable for genocide, and any woman who has menstruated would be liable for murder.

Thats just crazy. 

Hence, the first two effects are non-issues, as they happen BEFORE conception, or BEFORE the beginning of life.

The problem is with the third.

Implanon, the Embryo, and Technical Abortion
The legal issue is in Implanons third effect:
Implanon changes the uterine lining. i.e. makes it harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus.

In the off chance that a woman still manages to ovulate despite Implanon, plus the off chance that a sperm reaches it, the embryo will find it difficult to attach to the uterus because Implanon makes the uterus slippery.

And where does the embryo go to? Straight out of the vagina, and thats abortion. Technically, at least.
You see, after fertilization happens, the thing starts cell division by Day 2[UNSW], while moving from the fallopian tube to the uterus. Implantation of the embryo onto the uterus starts on Day 6 at the earliest and lasts for 12 days [EHD].

That is, a human being has been conceived by Day 2, and it will not survive past the first three weeks because Implanon makes the uterus too slippery for implantation to happen.


And thats why Implanon is likely to be declared unconstitutional, because it technically kills the embryo.


Yes, I have reason to believe that the DoHs 200-million Implanon stockpile may never get out of the warehouses.

But theres a way to move forward.

Lets compromise
Lets go back to the TRO thats active up to this day. Pro-RH camps have called for its lifting just this month, but to no avail [Star].

I believe that the TRO in effect is too far-reaching. Instead of just banning Implanon, it basically banned everything in the market.


Parang may isang noisy lang sa klase tapos lahat ng estudyante, pinalo.

And this is where I think theres an opportunity.

I believe that Implanon is the core issue that prevents SC from lifting the TRO. However, as I have explained, all other non-abortifacient RH products (e.g. personal lubricants, sex toys, whatever), can be declared constitutional per Griswold vs Connecticut.

In short, pro-RH camps can request the Supreme Court not to lift the TRO, but to AMEND it.

Implanon lang naman ang problema e, so Implanon na lang ang ibawal, wag lahat.

This way, we can move forward with the RH Laws implementation sans Implanon, then let government lawyers fight their way to show Implanon is OK.

The Implanon legal battle will take a while to settle, but we can at least move forward with everything else.

Garin may have good intentions, but even the best intentions are not enough without foresight.

Yes, Garin will be in hot water because it will appear that the government would tacitly admit Implanons unconstitutionality, but its in the publics best interest to gain greater access to RH products as soon as possible.

Fine, stop Implanon, but dont stop everything else. Thats what I am saying.",RJ Nieto,"November 24, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/11/rh-law-and-garins-implanon-did-doh.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"""Frailties of Woman"" Leni Robredo Version?","Earlier this month, President Rody Duterte cracked a joke about Vice-president Leni Robredos knees, The president said Robredo has smooth knees: it had no calluses. As expected, Robredo, her supporters, and womens rights groups denounced the presidents comments for what they perceive as mysoginy.

Lets call this the Le-Knee incident.

Dutertes Double Entendre
Now, everyone knows that the president is non-native Tagalog speaker. Aside from his linguistic quirks [TP: Media Guide], Duterte uses Binisayang Tagalog, which essentially is a word-for-word Tagalog translation of his native Cebuano, i.e. he thinks in Cebuano but he attempts to talk in Tagalog.

Dutertes statement about Lenis knees  that it had no calluses  was actually a double entendre, as the Cebuano for knees with no calluses is an idiom describing a lazy person, or someone who slacks in her job.
Duterte made those comments during the Typhoon Yolanda Commemoration Ceremony and three years after the Yolanda struck, the Liberal Party-led government, who managed the rehab efforts from 2013 to mid-2016, managed to complete only 10 percent of the housing projects [Inq].

Leni is the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council head. Shes also the highest-ranking politician of the Liberal Party. Thus, In short, Dutertes seemingly sleazy comment actually turned out to be a gentle reprimand for Robredo.

Dapat pa yatang magpasalamat non si Leni dahil hindi siya garapalang hiniya for her incompetence.

But then, I never really expected northerners to fully appreciate what the old man meant. Adding his history of unleashing tasteless comments [TP: Rape Joke], I perfectly understand the oppositions disinclination to extend to him the benefit of the doubt.

And so, Robredo retaliated.

Lenis Le-Knees
Asked about the seeming impropriety of his Le-Knee statement, the President said in defense, To break the ice, 'yun ang ginawa ko [thats what I did]. So what's so special about the body of a woman or the knee of the woman na walang kalyo [without callus]? Ibig sabihin baka hindi nagsisimba. [Maybe she doesn't go to church.] [CNN]

Duterte thinks the Le-Knee issue is trivial, but Leni thinks otherwise.

Tasteless remarks and inappropriate advances against women should have no place in our society. We should expect that most of all from our leaders, Robredo told [CNN], in retaliation to Dutertes remarks about her knees.

Judging from Robredos statement, a light-hearted comment about her knees is enough for her to get riled up. That is, a joke about her knees were enough for modest, reserved, and shy vice-president to feel that her womanhood was violated.

But just like the embattled Senator Leila de Lima, I feel like Robredo lacks an important ingredient for believability: consistency.

Kasi kung peminista ka, dapat para sa kapakanan ng LAHAT ng kababaihan, hindi ikaw lang.

Misogynistic Feminism
We all know that Duterte accused Senator Leila de Lima of having links to the illegal drug trade through her supposedly illicit relationship with her driver-cum-bodyguard Ronnie Dayan [TP: Oohh Ronnie]. De Lima cried foul, saying that Dutertes personal tirades violate her rights as a woman.

De Lima basically framed her dilemma as a crusade of women against misogyny.

The problem, however, is de Limas admission that she indeed had a sexual affair with Dayan, and that contrary to de Limas claim, Dayan was and is still legally married to his wife. De Lima hated the personal attacks, but she didnt mind violating the poor wifes rights as a woman and more importantly, as Dayans wife.

Theres lies the inconsistency. Theres no such thing as a misogynistic feminist and as it turns out, Robredo appears to be a misogynistic feminist too.

Comment vs Contact

Recall that Robredo said she was offended by the Le-Knee remark, saying that inappropriate advances against women should have no place in our society.

What I do not understand, however, is how Robredo couldnt tolerate inappropriate comments when she can, in fact, tolerate inappropriate contact.

Note that I am not insinuating that Leni and Bolet have carnal relations. However, given the more stringent moral guidelines Leni loves to impose on politicians from rival parties, it is reasonable to expect that she follows the same.
Platonic enough?
The image above, taken two days before the elections, shows Quezon City Representative Jorge Bolet Banal with his arms wrapped around Robredos shoulders and his face leaning toward hers.

As to whether this shows a close-but-platonic friendship or an intimate relationship is subject to debate. Besides, I am generally liberal-progressive when it comes to these stuff, and I wont really want to give this any color under normal circumstances.
The operative word is under normal circumstances, because its Leni were talking about. We are talking about a woman who feels violated even with just a comment about her knees. Thats how demure she is.

Salita pa lang feeling violated na e, haplos pa kaya?


That is, how could Leni find a joke about knees anti-woman, but she finds physical contact with a married man okay?

A Happily Married Bolet Banal?
Banal, the owner of the arm and face in question, may actually be a married man.

Let me make this very clear: I do not give a shit about Leni's love life. But if she, as the vice president, acts like she's Our Lady of Naga, then we have a problem.

According to the Congressional Spouses Foundation (CSFI) roster of members, Banal is married to a certain Carmela C. Banal [CSFI]. Public databases suggest C stands for Cruz [Geni], which sounds just about right, as Banal owns Cruz-Banal Enterprises [ADMU].


The CSFI members roster does not show a date of publication. Note, however, that the roster mentions Violetta Reyes representing Marinduque Rep. Regina O. Reyes, who happens to have won as Congressman only once in 2013 (16th Congress) [ABS].

That is, Bolet Banal was still married as of June 30, 2013, i.e. when the 16th Congress commenced.

Leni, nakukumustahan man lang ba kayo ni Carmela?

No online records suggest that their marriage has been annulled at any point after that. However, a reliable source said the Banals remained married up to this day, with no hint of separation. The source is a friend of Bolets father whose name shall not be disclosed for security reasons.

Yes, it appears that Bolet already has a wife, yet he still does things like

Is Leni a tad too close to this guy, or is he her hairdresser?


I do not really care about Lenis personal life, but when she starts acting like some self-proclaimed moralist, she better be sure she practices what she preaches.
One big happy...wait di ba may asawa na yan?!
If Leni wants to ride the moral high horse, she better be sure that she stays on it. Unfortunately, thats not happening right now with whatevers going on between Leni and Bolet, her married lifesaver.

Seriously, Leni finds the Le-Knee comment offensive, but having a married man wrap his arms around her shoulders, lean his head toward hers, and caress her hair so casually... is totally fine with her?

#MarcosNotAHero: WTF? Noynoy Aquino OK with Marcos' AFP Hero Honors,"I sincerely respect the outcry of some people against Ferdinand Marcos Libingan ng mga Bayani (LNMB) burial, such as UP Prof. Sarah Raymundo and Dra. Lorraine Badoy: I agree with most of their points.

What I do not agree with or at the least, what I do not respect, is the stance of my Aquino-aligned friends on the burial issue, for the simple reason that their leader  the Aquino Political Dynasty  doesnt give a shit about Marcos LNMB burial anyway.

Let me tell you why.


A Brief Recap
In my August 2016 article Marcos in LNMB? Lena really is a terrible lawyer, I explained how the mostly Liberal Party-led government of the past thirty years neglected to fix the legal loophole that made Marcos eligible for burial in the

In that article, I explained that former President Cory Aquino herself gave her imprimatur on the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) regulation enabling the Marcos burial which was, interestingly, penned by AFP Chief of Staff Fidel V. Ramos, the same person who succeeded Cory in 1992. I also explained how the Aquino Political Dynasty neglected to fix this accident for the next 30 years.

The Aquinos gave us two presidents (Cory, Noynoy), four senators (Noynoy, Butz, Bam, Tessie), and a horde of muti-term congressmen, of which Noynoy was also a part of. Despite this, none of them  not even one of their politicial minions  managed to even do something to revise the AFP regulation in question.

In response to a tweet related to the previous paragraph, Ambassador-designate Teddy Boy Locsin told me, It is hard to explain why something was not done; easier why something was done. Cory was not vindictive to look that far.

Whats the problem with this statement?

The Vindictive Cory Aquino
Democracy icon Cory Aquino, at least while still president, was actually vindictive.

In 1989, Philippine Star columnist Luis Beltran wrote that Cory hid under the bed amidst a coup detat, Cory retaliated by filing a libel suit against Beltran. Beltran and Star profusely apologized, but Cory rejected these apologies. Cory, as the President, even took the witness stand during the libel hearings. Eventually convicted, Beltran was jailed for half a year as a result [Teodoro 2003].

No forgiveness despite grovelling apologies resulting to Beltrans imprisonment? That sounds like a vendetta to me. Saying Cory wasnt vindictive. will make Journalist Chito Beltrans journalist father Luis Beltran roll in his grave.

But this is just a libel case, right? Well, theres another, much better example.
In 1989, a dying Ferdinand Marcos spoke to Vice-president Salvador Laurel. He said, Please tell Mrs. Aquino to stop sending me her relatives. They are proposing and asking so many things. All I want is to die in my countryI will run over 90 percent of all my worldly possessions to our conversation to our people. I ask only 10 percent for my family [Laurel 1997].

Marcos gave only one condition when he added, Just let me die in my own country. I want to be buried beside my mother [ibid].

Cory refused to receive Marcos message [ibid]. Yes, Cory didnt even let Marcos die in his own country which to me, isnt really too much to ask, especially since it defies logic.

If that is not vindictive, I dont know what else is.

Corys misplaced idealism... or stupidity
Marcos only asked for 10 percent, while the governments agent  who was trying to recover Marcos assets  was asking for twice that amount.
In 1986, Cory gave her blessings to Operation Big Bird, where Credit Manila President Michael de Guzman was supposed to recover the Marcos assets stored in Swiss banks, with de Guzman receiving a 20 percent commission for whatever loot was to be recovered. The plan was a complete failure after it was aborted, owing to conflicting viewpoints among government decision makers [MS].

The Philippine government did not recover any money from Operation Big Bird and it was even subjected to a congressional investigation years later [Chaikin 2000, p. 11]

And thirty years later, we are still going after the same assets. What if Cory just used common sense in 1989, would we still be having this problem today?

Corys Foresight (or the lack of it)
Lets go back Locsins statement, that Cory was not vindictive to look that far.

I have clearly explained how Cory has actually been one vindictive son of a gun, but I am inclined to agree with Locsin that Cory lacked foresight.

Cory was never a politician prior to her presidency. She actually was less qualified than opposition leader Laurel, but Laurel stepped aside because of EDSA fever. At that time, the public felt that a vote for Cory would be a vote for Ninoy a vote for what Ninoy represented in death [Brands 1992, p. 330].

That is, even it its quite possible that Marcos didnt order Ninoys death [TP: Marcos didnt kill Ninoy?], as witnesses pointed to Corys cousin Danding Cojuangco as the mastermind. Too bad the possible star witness, Ninoy assassin Pablo Martinez, that guy who can actually implicate Danding, was killed in a road accident in 2014 [TV5]. But I am digressing.


For the sake of argument, lets just assume that Locsin is partially right. Lets assume that Cory neither had the IQ nor the experience to look that far into the future, that the possibility of Marcos burial never entered her mind.

There are several issues with this alibi:

First, Marcos died in 1989, well within Corys term.
With the knowledge that former presidents have been buried in LNMB, it would take a lot of stupidity on Corys part for the idea of a Marcos LNMB burial to evade her. And if that idea didnt evade her brain, that would mean Cory thought a Marcos LNMB burial wouldnt be a big deal, and perhaps you know what that means.

Second, Cory wanted to erase everything Marcos.
Shortly after assuming office in 1986, Cory took every step to erase all traces of Marcos throughout the country [Time], essentially an attempt to diminish whatever Marcos positive achievements were. Surely, Cory cannot have such a short attention span: Marcos 1989 death should have reminded her that Oh shit, he may get buried there!

The Age-old LNMB Burial Issue
Res ipsa loquitur (Latin for ""the thing speaks for itself"") is a doctrine that basically says accidents imply negligence. That is, the accident that was Marcos eligibility for LNMB burial is a result of negligence, and negligence it was.

But for now, lets give Cory a pass. Lets just say shes just incapable of foresight, period. Instead, lets focus on what the Aquino Political Dynasty has done, post-Cory presidency, to rectify this oversight.


The fact of the matter is that the law that enabled Marcos LNMB burial is just an AFP regulation, something which can simply be superseded either by a simple request from the AFP Commander-in-Chief who happens to be the President, or if not enough, an Executive Order.

Two Aquino presidents, Cory and her son Noynoy, came and went, and not a single effort was taken to do either.

But lets assume that the Cory and her progeny are all idiots, so lets check whether Ninoys legistator-relatives did anything about it. After all, sans a presidential order and if such an LNMB burial really is a big deal, then the legislature could have done something about it through a law that expressly forbids a Marcos corpse in LNMB land.

Ninoy's brother Agapito Butz"" Aquino, who was a pillar of the anti-dictatorship movement and also a senator from 1986 to 1995, did did nothing about it [TV5].

Ninoys sister Tessie Dancing Queen Aquino-Oreta, a congresswoman from 1987 to 1998 and a senator from 1998 to 2004, did nothing either.

Benigno Bam Aquino IV, Ninoys grandnephew who milked the Ninoy likeness for all its worth, also did nothing in the three years that hes been in the senate. Bam was elected Senator in 2013.

The same goes for Ninoys cousin Jesli Aquino-Lapus, who was Tarlac 3rd Dist. Representative from 1998 to 2007, and for Ninoys uncle Herminio Aquino, who was the representative of the same district from 1992 to 1998.

Yes, none of them gave a Rat's Ass about the LNMB dilemma.

Yes, none of the Aquinos  the people who should have been most invested in influencing the historical trajectory of the Marcos narrative  gave a shit.

But wait! Theres more.

Noynoy OK with Marcos Medal of Valor
Just to demonstrate further that the Aquinos gave no shit about Marcos LNMB burial, it is to be recalled that Ninoys own son, PNoy, allowed Vice-president Jejomar Binay in April 2011 to decide on whether Marcos should be buried in LNMB or not [GMA].

Yes, Noynoy delegated whats supposed to be a crucial task to Jojo. Yes, Noynoy used the LNMB issue as a political booby trap for Mar Roxas likely rival in 2016.


Yes, Noynoy didnt want to have a say on it. He wanted Binay to decide.

Whats worse? Theres something else that happened on that same day .

In reference to the AFP Medal of Valor awarded to the late Ferdinand Marcos, Aquino Deputy Spokesperson Abigail Valte in 2011 said, These awards continue to be on the official roster of awards of the AFP. Until otherwise revoked, the awardees continue to receive appropriate recognition [TV5].

Valte never retracted this statement, and no one in PNoys Malacanang  including PNoy himself  even attempted to downplay, let alone retract, Valtes statement.

What does that mean? That means PNoy himself recognizes Marcos eligibility for a Medal of Valor award.

And what happens to Medal of Valor recipients? I don't know how what kind of semantic acrobatics the yellow camp will use to get out of this, but Medal of Valor awardess are technically heroes, you know.

Case in point, Medal of Valor awardees are included in AFPs Hall of Heroes [Star]. Yes, even before the LNMB burial and since the Medal of Valor award in 1968, Marcos has already been included in the AFPs Hall of Heroes -- and the Noynoy Aquino was OK with that.

I do not recall any protest in the past 30 years regarding the same.

Yup, nobody in the Aquino Family -- even the blabbermouth Kris Aquino -- spoke against it.


And by the way, where can Medal of Valor awardees be buried?

In the Libingan ng mga Bayani [ABS].

"GOOD NEWS! After seeing viral video, DPWH to build Iligan bridge","Sec. Mark Villar, through his media officer, said DPWH to build bridge in Iligan after seeing viral video.

On 14 November 2016, MinYas Mangorsi posted a Facebook video showing two schoolchildren crossing an improvised bridge on the way to school.

The bridge, situated in a rural part of Iligan City in Mindanao, was just a pair of ropes held up by wooden stilts, over a raging river.

The two kids face mortal danger as they pass through this flimsy structure every day.

The video quickly went viral after it was reuploaded a day later by digital activist Mocha Uson on her Facebook page, with a total of 2 million views so far.

But the story didnt end there.

DPWH Sec. Mark Villar
Now, if you've been following the ThinkingPinoy Facebook page, I interviewed Public Works Secretary Mark Villar on 04 November 2016, so I maintained contact with DPWH since then.


On the same day Mocha Uson reposted the viral video, Sec. Villars media officer Anna Mae Llamentillo (DPWH) messaged me.

The following conversation ensued:
DPWH: Mocha posted a video of kids. Would you know location? Could I get her contact details? I showed Sec. (Villar) the video. We at DPWH can help.
ThinkingPinoy (TP): Ayy! Yung nasa ilog?(Oh! The one at the river?)
DPWH: Yup!
TP: Ask ko sa manager ni Mocha. (Ill ask Mochas manager.)
DPWH: Thanks!
A few minutes later
TP: Uy teh, its in G'tum, Brgy. Lanipao, Iligan City. Kung may plano kayong gawin, let me know. People want to know kasi. (Hey sis, its in G'tum, Brgy. Lanipao, Iligan City. If you plan to do something, let me know. Because people want to know.)
DPWH: Gotcha. Papupuntahan pa namin. Super duper thank you! (Gotcha. Were sending somebody there. Super duper thank you!)
And there I was, amazed by the idea that social media is real. But wait! Theres more.

DPWH to build bridge
Just tonight, DPWHs Llamentillo messaged me again to give an update.
DPWH: Hahaha! Sabi ni Sec Villar, ipapagawa na namin yung bridge! May short-term at long-term. Bigyan kita ng details bukas. Baka umpisa na next week, pinagawan lang namin muna ng design. Hahahaha! (Hahahah! Sec. Villar said were going to build the bridge! Theres a short-term and a long-term [bridge]. Ill give you details tomorrow. We might start building next week, were just had to get designs first.)
TP: Ang taray! Paano plano? Jusko tulo luha ko nong napanood yong video. (So fierce! Whats the plan? My god, I shed tears when I watched that video.)
Llamentillo said they already are in the process of securing permits.
DPWH: Balak namin by December pero we're still checking feasibility Outside of our jurisdiction kasi. Kailangan pa namin magpasintabi sa LGU. Hahahaha! (We plan [to build] by December but were still checking feasibility because its outside our jurisdiction. We still have to ask clearance from the LGU [Local Government Unit]. Hahahaha!)

TP: Papayag yon malamang. (They will probably give consent.)

DPWH: Ayusin ko lang yung permit. Hahaha! (Ill just secure the permit. Hahaha!)

DPWH: GMA reported about it [GMA] and Ivan Mayrina said he wasnt able to get a statement from the LGU so we just assumed responsibility. Sec Villar said we can just take the initiative and do it.

TP: Oo nga, tama na tsaka na muna ang sisihan, mga bata muna. (I agree. Its just right to set aside the blaming for now, lets think about the kids first.)

Short-term bridge now, long-term bridge later
Llamentillo said they will construct the temporary bridge in as early as December, with a long-term, sturdier bridge to follow.
DPWH: May initial report na ako kanina. Napuntahan na ng tao namin. Pabibilisan namin to. (I received the initial report earlier today. Our field agents have inspected the area. We will do this ASAP.)

TP: Alam mo ba sabi nung mga readers ko? Kahit hanging bridge lang daw muna. Basta lang daw di sila mahulog. (You know what my readers said? Even a simple hanging bridge will do, just so they wont fall to their deaths.)

DPWH: Hanging bridge nga yung ipapagawa naming as a temporary solution. Yun yung short term na sinabi ko earlier. Pero maganda ang design. Di naman masyadong bara-bara. Yung long-term bridge, pinag-aaralan pa, mas complex kasi yon. (Yeah, were building a hanging bridge as a temporary solution, thats the short term I was referring to earlier. But the design is good, its well thought out. We are still studying the long-term bridge option because thats a more complex issue.)

TP: Ayyy sige! Isusulat ko to! (Oh, okay! Ill blog about this!)

DPWH: Pabibilisan namin to. Yung actual construction one month long daw kasi 30 meters ang lapad ng ilog. (Well complete the project at the soonest. The actual construction takes a month because the river is 30 meters wide.)

TP: Sige, sige iba-blog ko! Yehey! (Okay, okay, Ill blog about this! Yahoo!)

DPWH: Hahahaha! Exciting!

TP: Yes it is!

So there it is. These are one of those moments when I feel that this country still has hope!",RJ Nieto,"November 17, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/11/seeing-viral-video-dpwh-sec-villar-build-bridge-iligan.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
1979 Iranian Revolution means Marcos didnt kill Ninoy?,"Who killed Ninoy Aquino? The 1979 Iranian Revolution suggests Marcos' didn't do it.


The Supreme Court recently decided in favor of burying the remains of the late Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani. The pro-burial crowd urged healing and closure, but the anti-burial crowd said the Marcos Family should return its ill-gotten wealth and pay for the gross Martial Law-era human rights violations before discussions on healing and closure can even begin.

In my August 2016 article Marcos in LNMB? Leni Robredo really is a terrible lawyer, I explained that the 30 years worth of Aquino neglect made Marcos LNMB burial. That is, the Aquino political dynasty, despite having control over the legislature for so long, neglected to pass even one law  or even file one bill  that would make Marcos LNMB burial illegal. Because of the Aquinos neglect, the doctrine of nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege (there is no crime when there is no law punishing it [SC GR 176364])  applied to the Marcos case.

The irony of it all is that Benigno Ninoy Aquino Jr.s namesakes both failed miserably in preventing this from happening. Benigno Simeon Noynoy Aquino III was a senator for six years and a congressman for nine yet he still failed to even file one bill about it. The same goes with Senator Paolo Benigno Bam Aquino IV, who has been a senator for 3 years and counting. PNoy was also president for six years, so he had to power, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, to issue a simple order banning Marcos LNMB burial  a power that he never exercised.

Seriously, if the anti-burial crowd thinks Marcos LNMB burial is a the biggest insult to this nations history, then I guess they should start suing Noynoy and Bam for criminal negligence [BatasNatin].

The Death of Ninoy Aquino
Of all the people killed during Marcos time, the highest-profile victim, perhaps, is Benigno Ninoy Aquino Jr., who was shot dead on the airport tarmac after returning to the country in 1983. And now that were at it, why dont we examine the circumstances surrounding his death?

After all, it was Ninoys death has been used  ad nauseam  as the prime example of Marcos atrocities. His death triggered the chain of events that culminated into what was the First EDSA revolution. Ninoys death catapulted an erstwhile unpalatable Cory Aquino to the presidency. And most importantly, Ninoys death is the symbolic anchor of everything that the Yellow Camp stands for.

Hence, lets ask: who killed Ninoy in the first place?

Ferdinand Marcos did it?
Ferdinand Marcos, Ninoys archenemy is the easiest answer to this question. The problem, however, is that this answer is too easy. I have been blogging about contemporary Philippine Politics for about a year now and if theres something that I have learned after having written 200 articles, its that digging a little deeper usually shows a different, and often more sinister picture.

Thus, after a bit of digging, let me first tell you why I think Marcos couldnt have ordered Ninoys assassination.
Ninoy was the poster boy of the political opposition and his popularity in the 70s and 80s is unquestionable. Killing him will make him a martyr, and martyrdom can catalyze revolutions. We all know what happened after Ninoy died: widespread unrest, the EDSA revolution, Marcos overthrow, and the installation of a Marcos-less government.

We can all call Marcos diabolical, evil, murderous, or even genocidal. But if theres one thing that Marcos is not, its stupid. Yes, even Marcoss staunchest critics will concede that the old man is extremely cunning and smart.

Could Marcos have foreseen such a possibility?

Well, because four years prior to Ninoys fateful (and fatal) homecoming, a similar  almost identical  chain of events happened in Iran, and its called the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Marcos should have been very aware of the events in Iran, as no one can argue that Iran was outside Marcos radar.
Marcos wife Imelda seems to have been close to (or at least, was very interested in) the Pahlavis of Iran. On the way home from Rome in 1969, Imelda stopped by Iran to visit the Shah. Imelda was also part of a diplomatic visit to Iran in 1971 for the 2,500th Year Celebration of the Persian Empire [Garcia 2016].

I will now give you a rundown of that chapter in Iranian history, then I will explain how it paralleled the Philippine situation in the months preceding Ninoys assassination.

British Monopoly over Iranian Oil
Context is essential, so before I talk about the 1979 Iranian Revolution, let me give you a quick background of the events that happened before that.

Since the early 1900s, a single British company, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), had a monopoly over Irans vast petroleum resources. At the time, AIOC was the most profitable British company on the planet [CBS]. AIOC is the predecessor company of todays British Petroleum (BP) [Henniker 2013].
AIOCs cheap oil fueled UK economic boom, cheap oil made possible by the exploitation of Iranian workers, causing discontent to spread among the population. Reza Shah, the ruling Iranian monarch, struck a 1933 agreement with AIOC, with the latter promising to give laborers better pay and more opportunities for advancement, build schools, hospitals, roads and a telephone system. AIOC didnt fulfill its promises [NWE].

In 1950, the Iranians found out that the United States, which historically monopolized Saudi oil through the American Arabian Oil Company (todays Saudi Aramco), agreed to split profits 50-50 with the Saudis [PSU]. The Iranians, who have been receiving pitifully miniscule royalties from AIOC, wanted a similar deal with the British. The Britons rejected their demand [NWE].

Britain continued to exercise control over Irans natural resources, and Iranians continuously protested over their lack of power in their homeland. This feeling of helplessness among Iranians fueled nationalistic sentiments, and nationalism for Iranians means taking back control of Iranian oil.

The Iranian Struggle for Economic Independence
In retaliation to the British, the Iranian Parliament voted in 1951 to nationalize the AIOC and installed nationalist Mohammed Mossadegh as Prime Minister[NWE].

The UK retaliated by launching an ICJ case versus Iran, but the ICJ dismissed the case in 1952 for lack of jurisdiction, as the ICJ affects only treaties ratified from 1933 onwards, and the treaty concerning AIOC was signed before that [ICJ: UK vs Iran].

The UK did not give up. Enlisting help of the CIA, the UK covertly supported the 1953 Iranian coup detat which overthrew the democratically-elected Mossadegh [GWU], turning Iran from a constitutional monarchy to an absolute monarchy with the House of Pahlavi at the helm.

Thus, after two short years of relative independence, Iran was under UK control again  all in the name of oil. The pre-1950s social unrest was back after the 1953 coup. Yes, its back again, and it became the sleeping monster that was the foundation of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

The 1979 Iranian Revolution
Dissent against the Pahlavi dynasty intensified, with religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini serving as the figurehead after he urged in 1963 the ruling Shah to recognize the governments mistakes and to abandon Western dependence and calling the shah a miserable wretch in the process. Khomeini was the first major figure to speak against the monarchy, as everyone fears violent retaliation from the government [Providence].

And surely enough, he was put in jail and while incarcerated, Ayatollah Khomeini slowly became a symbol of the Iranian opposition.
Over a decade later in October 1977, Khomeinis son and chief aide Mostafa mysteriously died. The government said it was a heart attack, but the public believed it was a covert government-sanctioned assassination [Spencer 2016]. The public saw Mostafas death as an attack against the Khomeini family, which at the time was at the forefront of the resistance.

Widespread, long term anti-government protests in major Iranian cities followed. Public sentiment continued to grow against the Pahlavi regime and in September 1978, the Armed Forces fired against thousands of protesters, killing dozens. Known as Black Friday, this was the pivotal event of the 1979 revolution and the start of the Pahlavi Dynastys downfall. The ruling Shah fled Iran in January 1979 and Khomeini returned from his exile in France and Iraq to fill the power vacuum [UChicago].


The Khomeinis and their allies have dominated Iranian government from then up to this day.

The Basic Elements of Iranian Revolution
To make comparisons easier, lets think of the Iranian Revolution as a recipe, i.e. a set of ingredients processed in a certain sequence.

First, widespread discontent among the masses: the oil issue bugged Iranians for decades, and the uneven economic growth of post-1953 Iran simply added fuel to the fire.

Second, an oppressed but popular opposition: we are referring not only to the Khomeinis, but also the political opposition that was also the victim of the repressive Pahlavi Regime.

Third, a suitable and willing establishment-backed replacement: Ayatollah Khomeini, who the public sees as the one with the moral ascendancy to lead Iran should the Pahlavis be overthrown.

Fourth, a flurry of crowd mobilizers: the Shiite clerics loyal to Khomeini throughout Iran have the power and influence to mobilize the masses

Fifth, a powerful catalyst: the perceived martyr Mostafa Khomeini.

Now, lets check the Philippine Situation before August 1983 and see which of these ingredients were already present at that time.

Marcos and pre-August 1983 Philippines
First, widespread discontent of the masses, stemming from Martial Law human rights violations, was already present before the 80s. Some pro-Marcos camps may argue that these excesses were confined to a small chunk of the population, but the fact remains that these events were sufficiently publicized [TP: Mosquito Press] to make the masses care enough about whats happening.

Adding fuel to the fire is the economic recession that started in 1982, a year before Ninoys assassination [WB].


Second, an oppressed but popular opposition: The relatively popular Liberal Party of the 70s and 80s, starting from the fateful 1971 Plaza Miranda Bombing [MT], has always been seen as the oppressed opposition.

Third, a suitable and willing establishment-backed replacement: heres where Ninoy Aquino comes in. He is, after all, the poster boy of the oppressed opposition. Other potential replacements were Marcos-era Opposition leader Salvador Laurel [MT], Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile [Kawato 2015, p. 165], and Philippine Constabulary Chief Fidel Ramos, and Marcos billionaire lackey Ambassador Eduardo Danding Cojuangco [TP: Coco Levy].

Fourth, a flurry of crowd mobilizers: the Catholic hierarchy headed by oppositionist Jaime Cardinal Sin can provide the warm bodies. Since 1972, Sin has been critical of the Marcos regime [Guardian].

Thus, we are left with the fifth and final ingredient: a catalyst.

The Missing Fifth Ingredient
Marcos couldve pretended that hes still the most popular guy around, but he most probably got a wake up call when he allowed Ninoy to speak on national TV in 1978. The streets were empty as everyone watched Ninoy live [Unjieng 2009, p.133], just like todays streets when Pacquiao has a boxing match.

Marcos knows killing Ninoy is a bad idea. Despite having been out of the publics eye during his six-years-and-counting detention, the publics interest in Ninoy seems to not have abated.

Yes, the Philippine situation in the years preceding 1983 was almost ripe for a revolution, and the only thing thats missing is the fifth ingredient: a powerful catalyst, and Marcos should have known the entire time that Ninoy Aquino was a (if not the) potentially powerful catalyst.

Yes, Marcos knows that Ninoys death is his own downfall, as evidenced by the political concessions he made after 1979, and here are some examples:
In 1980, Marcos allowed Ninoy to fly to the US to receive medical treatment [NYTimes].
In 1981, he lifted martial Law, along with the release of 341 inmates, half of which are political prisoners [GovPH].
In a 1982 bid to restore the 'prestige, integrity and good name' of the scandal-plagued Philippines Supreme Court, Marcos accepted the mass resignation of all 14 justices [UPI].
Whats clear, by early 1983 at the latest, is that Marcos was feeling the heat. Already old and sickly [Unjieng 2009, p.133], Marcos knows that his grip on power was precarious at best.

And the last thing hed want would be to kill Ninoy, as that will provide the fifth and final ingredient for his fall from grace.

This bears repeating: given the circumstances and the events immediately preceding 1983, killing Ninoy will trigger a revolution, an overthrow of the Marcos autocracy.

If Marcos killed Ninoy, then Marcos must be stupid.

But Marcos is not stupid, right?

So if Marcos didnt kill Ninoy, who did?

I have a pretty good idea who did it, but Ill save that for my next post.",RJ Nieto,"November 17, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/11/1979-iranian-revolution-means-marcos.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Sen. Leila de Lima cites Frailties of a Woman? No, that's called crime!","De Lima's interview last night has basically opened the floodways of court cases. With last night's admission, let's check the laws, rules, or regulations that LP attack pig Leila de Lima may have violated.

Background

In an interview with GMA7s Winnie Monsod, De Lima finally categorically admitted that she had an affair with Ronnie Dayan. Evaluating that admission against what we have learned during the Congressional Hearings, lets take a look at what the future will hold for the infamous Liberal Party attack pig.

In the show Bawal ang Pasaway, Monsod asked de Lima, The question that arises from the minds of everybody, Why did she fall for a driver-bodyguard?

De Lima answered, Frailties of a Woman.

Monsod asked, How long did the affair last?

De Lima said, A few years? We became so close, thats it, because I trusted him. And syempre, naano po ang loob ko.

De Lima also admitted to giving Dayan financial privileges.

Monsod said, The problem with Dayan is he was married daw.

De Lima said Dayan was already legally separated from his wife.

Wait, legal separation means the two are still married. Wait, what kind of lawyer is this?

Before the show aired, de Lima has already admitted to the Manila Times that she had close ties with Dayan. However, she refused to explain the exact nature of that close relationship.

We got close, but just how close I will no longer touch on that because its too personal, de Lima said [MT].

But now that she has admitted having ""privileged access"" to Dayan's ""masculine territory""...

Concubinage?
According to the Rules of Court, Rule 138, Section 27 [LawPhil]:

Attorneys removed or suspended by Supreme Court on what grounds.  A member of the bar may be removed or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for grossly immoral conduct

Now, concubinage is our most probable knee-jerk reaction upon reading grossly immoral conduct, where concubinage is defined by the Revised Penal Code Article 334 [ChanRobles] asArt. 334. Concubinage.  Any husband who shall have sexual intercourse, under scandalous circumstances, with a woman who is not his wife shall be punished by prision correccional in its minimum and medium periods. The concubine shall suffer the penalty of destierro.

SIDE NOTE: Destierro is banishment [LawCenter].
De Lima admitted she had an affair [had sexual intercourse] with Dayan while she was Justice Secretary [under scandalous circumstances]. However, she can only be prosecuted if the case is filed by Dayans aggrieved wife.

Revised Penal Code Article 344 states:
Prosecution of the crimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape and acts of lasciviousness.  The crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended spouse.
If Dayans wife files a case against Dayan and de Lima, then de Lima will most probably be convicted and subsequently disbarred.

A concubinage lawsuit is the best option if the purpose is to have de Lima disbarred, as she herself admitted committing the crime so there arent many options for her as far as legal defenses go.

The problem, however, is if the wife will sue.

If she doesnt, that doesnt mean de Lima is already off the hook.

Grave Scandal

While we cannot sue De Lima for concubinage because we are not Dayans wife, we can still sue her for Grave Scandal.

According to the Revised Penal Code Art. 200 [ChanRobles]:

The penalties of arresto mayor and public censure shall be imposed upon any person who shall offend against decency or good customs by any highly scandalous conduct not expressly falling within any other article of this Code.
Now, I checked the elements of Grave Scandal [Reviewer] and these are:
Offender performs an act
Act is highly scandalous as offending against decency or good customs
Highly scandalous conduct does not expressly fall within any other article of the RPC
Committed in a public place or within the public knowledge or view. (The public view is not required, it is sufficient if in public place. For public knowledge, it may occur even in a private place; the number of people who sees it is not material).
Now, let me explain how this can work.

First, the act in question will not be the De Lima-Dayan affair itself, as the act should have been committed publicly. Instead, it shall be de Limas admission of  the existence of an affair between Dayan and her and  De Limas provision of financial favors to Dayan while as the affair ensued.

Second, is it socially acceptable for a sitting Justice Secretary to have an affair with her married driver-bodyguard? No, thats just wrong. Is it socially acceptable for a sitting Senator to publicly admit such an affair transpired? No, she should have kept those horrid details to herself. Is it socially acceptable for a public official, who happens to be the paramour, to grant financial favors to her driver-lover? No.

Third, concubinage falls under Article 334, but the public admission of concubinage is not.

Fourth, she committed the act, i.e. she admitted to being a concubine, on National TV.

If convicted for Grave Scandal, de Lima may be imprisoned for one to six months (Arresto Mayor) [BatasNatin]. This will also be grounds for disbarment.

But wait, theres more!

Grave Scandal is probably the kindest option for anyone who wants to see de Lima behind bars, as it is generally considered a misdemeanor.

Yes, we may be able to sue her for something better than Grave Scandal.

Sexual Harassment

De Lima may also be sued for sexual harassment.

According to RA 7877, Sec.3 [UMN]:

Sexual harassment is committed by any other person who, having authority over another in a work environment requires any sexual favor from the other, regardless of whether the demand, request or requirement for submission is accepted by the object of said Act.

In a work-related environment, sexual harassment is committed when the sexual favor is made as a condition in granting said individual favorable privileges

Now, let me break this down for you.
 
First, de Lima has authority over her bodyguard-driver Ronnie Dayan.

Second, de Lima clearly required sexual favors from Dayan, as shown by her admission of having a love affair with him.


Third, Dayans acceptance of such a requirement is immaterial.


Fourth, then-Justice Secretary de Lima clearly wouldnt have given Dayan financial privileges if she didnt have access to his penis. I believe the key to winning this case is through interrogating other de Lima employees and ask them if de Lima gave them the same financial favors given to Dayan. If that can be established, then theres a good chance we can win this case. For example, we can ask Joenel if he, like Dayan, was given a house and lot package [Inq].

Oh, wait! Joenel also granted de Lima penile access, right?

Shit.

But wait, theres more!

Graft and Corruption
De Lima could have also violated Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019).
RA 3019 Section 2 includes appointive public officials and employees in the definition Public officer. De Lima is obviously a public official. Dayan, being a de Lima appointee, is also a public officer under this definition.
According to RA 3019 Sec. 3(a), Corrupt practices of public officers include [Gov]:
Persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority or an offense in connection with the official duties of the latter, or allowing himself to be persuaded, induced, or influenced to commit such violation or offense.
De Lima persuaded, induced, or influenced Dayan to agree to conspire in committing sexual harassment, with the sexual harassment issue explained in the previous section.

Needless to say, Republic Acts are rules and regulations promulgated by competent authority, and the Sexual Harassment Laws applicability on both de Lima and Dayan are underscored by Aquino-era Labor Secretary Rosalinda Dimapilis-Baldozs 2011 call on employers to help avoid sexual harassment incidents [Gov]. De Lima is basically Dayans immediate employer.


De Lima may also have violated RA 3019 Sec. 3(b), which states [Gov]:

Corrupt practices of public officers (include) Directly receiving any benefit, for himself in connection with (a) contract between the Government and any other part, wherein the public officer in his official capacity has to intervene under the law.

The contract here would be Dayans employment contract, where the employer would be Leila de Lima in behalf of the government in her capacity as Justice Secretary.

And as for the benefit, its her access to Ronnie Dayans penis.

Code of Ethics for Public Officials
The Code of Ethics for Public Officials (RA 6713) Section 4(b) states [Gov]:

Public officials and employees shall endeavor to discourage wrong perceptions of their roles as dispensers or peddlers of undue patronage.
Needless to say, having an affair with a driver-bodyguard AND giving him financial benefits in the process directly violates this section.

Moreover, Section 7(d) states:
Public officials and employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any favor (or) entertainment from any person in the course of their official duties or in connection with any operation being regulated by, or any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their office. De Lima, the public official, accepted sexual favors (or entertainment, if you want to put it that way) in connection with Dayans employment which is affected by her functions as DoJ secretary.

I wont expound on this anymore. Its as clear as day.

Not just sex
Heres the thing: Leilas interview also reminded me that she also did something else that clearly violated RAs 3019 and 3713.

De Lima said in the interview, advise sa akin nung dating BuCor Director Bucayu tsaka ni Gen. Villasanta na wag daw ho munang isama na ipalipat din si Jaybee Sebastian doon sa NBI detention facility dahil papatayin daw po iyang si Jaybee dahil siya po ang isa sa mga sources nung information about doon sa mga ginagawa nila Colangco. Kaya in that sense, naturingan po siyang isang asset.


(Translation: Bureau of Corrections Director Bucayu and Gen. Villasanta advised me against transferring Jaybee Sebastian to the NBI detention facility because he will get killed. Jaybee is a source of information about Colangcos misdeeds so in that sense, he considered an asset.)

Now, RA 3019 Sec. 3(k) states:
Corrupt practices of public officers (include) divulging valuable information of a confidential character, acquired by his office or by him on account of his official position to unauthorized persons, or releasing such information in advance of its authorized release date.

The confidential information was that inmate Sebastian is an asset, information she was acquired as Justice Secretary. She then released that information to the public last month De Lima in September [GMA], a public that is clearly unauthorized to know of such a thing as it would be prejudicial to the ongoing Bilibid investigations.

She even released this information despite knowing at that time that Sebastian was incarcerated in Building 14 where the NBI detainees were relocated. Oh, and did I say Sebastian was stabbed because of it [ABS]?

Clearly, any self-respecting person, let alone a public officer, will give priority to another persons life over saving her reputation.

De Lima isnt that kind of person.

RA 6713 reiterates this in Section 7(c), which states:
Public officials and employees shall not use or divulge, confidential or classified information officially known to them by reason of their office and not made available to the public to prejudice the public interest.
Yes, de Lima violated two birds with one stone.

Lawyers Code

Lets take a look at three pertinent rules in the Code of Professional Responsibility:

Rule 1.01 states:
A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct [Chan-Robles].
Violations of RA 6713 and RA 3019 fall under unlawful conduct. Meanwhile, Concubinage, Grave Scandal, and Sexual Harassment fall under unlawful AND immoral conduct.

Rule 7.03 states:
A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession [Chan-Robles].

Surely, a well-known lawyer publicly admitting having an affair with her married driver-bodyguard AND giving him financial favors is scandalous. Now, add the fact that this driver-bodyguard collected drug payolas from prisoners.

Whats worse, the best de Lima could muster was doubt the allegations against Dayan. The operative word here is doubt and not deny: doubt is uncertainty of the truthfulness, while deny implies certainty of falsehood. Bar topnotcher like de Lima should be sufficiently familiar with the difference.

Now, tell me, how else can de Lima avoid disbarment or worse, prison?

Dont tell me this is just a the frailty of a woman. [ThinkingPinoy.net]

"A President Trump? Good for Duterte's PH, Bad for Liberal Party","Donald Trump won the US elections. I admit that I was thoroughly shocked, given that electoral surveys historically predicted a Clinton win. I guess the scandalous Podesta emails [NBC], which gave the American public invaluable insight on the corruption pervading the political establishment, did her in.

The reactions to Trumps win have been mixed. We can expect jubilation at the Trump camp, thats a given. However, what surprised me was the magnitude of the reaction from the other side: passionate Clinton supporters crying in disbelief, the crash of Canadas immigration website, etc.

Even my Jewish best friend, who's been in New York his entire life, told me, I'm depressed and scared.

There shall be a truckload of articles that will attempt to predict what Trumps win entails for America, thats a given: I will not be writing another article just to add to that noise.

Instead, I will explain what Trumps win means for the Philippines, and let me start it off by saying:

A Trump win may be good for the Philippines, and let me tell you why.

If Duterte is removed
We all know that the Liberal Party wants Duterte out of Malacaang as soon as possible [TP: Assassinate]. However, if the massively popular Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte gets deposed, we can expect at least three things:
First, massive civil unrest
Whats clear is that Dutertes campaign woke up the anger of the populace of decades of post-Marcos government incompetence. If the population will simply hold a peaceful anti-Robredo EDSA Revolution, that would be relatively bearable. But who can serve as a tolerable replacement? And will the people be able to temper their anger and frustration while at it? If neither condition is fulfilled, this civil unrest may likely lead to widespread civil disobedience and even bloody riots.

Second, anti-American retaliation
I sincerely pray this wont happen, but we can never discount this possibility. If the public finds out that the US helped LP depose Duterte, theres a real possibility of potentially violent retaliation against about 30,000 [PSA] Americans in the country. We know that isnt good.

Third, a civil war
Duterte is the first president to give Muslim separatists and communist rebels a real shot at peace after decades upon decades of failed government promises, and its likely that the latter believe that this is their last chance at attaining it. This cannot be more true for Nur Misuari who, like Duterte, is already of advanced age.

That is, Dutertes removal may translate into a civil war [Inq] with a prospective Robredo Government on one side and a hodgepodge alliance of Muslim rebels, communists, and extremely disgruntled citizens on the other. I may (emphasis on ""may"") even be one of them.

But most importantly, deposing Duterte will leave a fractured nation that provides easier entry for ISIS if and when the latter gets driven out of the Middle East.

Yes, its that bad, but the oppositionist Liberal Party is at it, and it seeks to bolster its campaign by wooing American support.

It starts with Plan ICC
Duterte himself admitted that the governments crusade against criminality, drugs, and corruption, along with his campaign to set up a Federal government and his attempt at etching an independent foreign policy, will take a considerable amount of time. Unfortunately, his political longevity is under threat as his international image continuously erodes.

Today, the global public generally views President Rodrigo Duterte as an unrelenting human rights violator, with some camps putting him in the league of fallen leaders Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, and Adolf Hitler. Dutertes negative international image would have been irrelevant if not for the risk of public clamor that may trigger an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation, a risk made more real by Gambian ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensoudas recent statements [Star].

An announcement of an ICC investigation of Dutertes human rights record, let alone a conviction, will certainly obliterate the new presidents international legitimacy, drastically weakening his bargaining power in the international arena.

Regime Change after ICC
And what happens when Duterte loses his international legitimacy? He can more easily be deposed by the pro-US opposition led by the Liberal Party, and with help from the United States. An assassination., an ICC conviction, an accident There are many ways to do it.

Yes, a President Leni Robredo may not be palatable for most Filipinos, but for LP, its better than nothing. LP can settle for someone who may not enjoy local support, but enjoys international recognition, similar to the kind of presidency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had.
But will the US really help LP kick Duterte out?

Yes, for three reasons:
Because the United States has a history of supporting, or even effecting, regime change in other countries to suit US interests.
Because [TP: Dutertes international policy realignment] is a humongous headache for the United States.
Because the Liberal Party, a staunch US ally, has close connections with major US policymakers.

Lets tackle these one by one.

First, America's history with Regime Change
If US vs Nicaragua says anything, its that the Americans are not averse into violating the sovereignty of other countries by financially supporting candidates who are better aligned to their interests. In 1989, the US Congress passed HR 3385 to provide assistance for free and fair elections in Nicaragua. [Congress], although it really was aimed to support the (successful) presidential bid of unpopular but US-aligned candidate Violeta Chamorro.

But its not just about elections.
The US has a long history of militarily intervening in other countries domestic politics, with the most recent one being the operations in Libya against Muammar Gaddafi [PBS], in Syria against Bashar Al-Assad, and in Iraq against Saddam Hussein [CNN].

All these three Humanitarian Interventions by the United States backfired. The Americans kicked out Gaddafi then the terrorists took over the Syrian Government. American operations in Syria led to the creation of ISIS [Harvard]. Americas overthrow of Saddam caused a power vacuum that eventually led to an ongoing civil war and the rise of Iraqi extremism [Time].


And Duterte has pointed out these three examples many, many times.


In short, the US has done it before, so it can still do it again. For one, Ramos unexpected 180-degree turn over Dutertes foreign policy is a testament to US pressure [TP: Team PH Losing]. At first I though it was a just an internal misunderstanding between Ramos and Duterte, until the latter threw major shade at the former president last week [Video].

Second, US-PH relations
Relations between the Philippines and United States took a massive turn for the worse as soon as Duterte occupied Malacaang, with the most poignant piece of evidence being Dutertes dtente with China. In one fell swoop, Duterte managed to position the country from a staunch US ally to somewhere in the middle of the US-China power struggle. And did I mention Dutertes frequent anti-West tirades [TP: Hitler]?

Dutertes foreign policy realignment, in essence, is a major obstacle for Americas Pivot to Asia. Because of Duterte, America will find it harder to enhance its sociopolitical and military influence in Asia. I need not expound on this anymore.

Third, LP has the connections
The Liberal Party has always been known to have very closed relations with the United States. Aside from the pro-American foreign policy decisions over the past six years that hurt Philippine interests [TP: Yasays Face], several key people within the party are known to have close ties with key people in the US political establishment.

The Gerry Roxas Foundation, founded by LP President Mar Roxas father Gerry Roxas, has received a US$ 24 million grant from USAID. USAID, the American Governments philanthropic arm, is widely considered as a covert tool for advancing US interests abroad at the expense of their host countries [QZ].

The organization has previously been expelled in Russia [BBC], Bolivia [BBC], Ecuador [NBC], Cuba, Dominica, Venezuela, and Nicaragua [VA].

That says a lot, but theres one more thing: LPs connection with Loida Nicolas-Lewis of the influential Washington lobby group US Philippines Society (USPS).

Loida and USPS people
USPS most vocal member, the billionaire Loida Nicolas Lewis, has actively campaigned for LPs Mar Roxas and Leni Robredo [Inq]. This is the same Loida that Duterte accused of plotting to support massive demonstrations against the latter [FB].

Sitting as USPS co-chairman is Metro Pacifics Manny V. Pangilinan [USPS], the same person who conspired with Aquino Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario to sell us out to China [TP: Spratlys].


Dutertes May 2016 win spelled trouble for two of MVPs major businesses. First, Dutertes friendliness with China essentially killed Philex Petroleum [TP: Chef Duterte]. Second, Environment Secretary Gina Lopez is torturing MVPs mining interests, and Duterte himself told MVP,  I know you are not happy with my new DENR secretary [GMA].

Philippine Ambassador to the US Joey Cuisia, also a USPS director, is not happy with Duterte either. He rejected Dutertes offer to extend his ambassadorship, citing his dissatisfaction over Perfecto Yasays appointment as Foreign Secretary [TV5].

USPS Director Maurice Greenberg was Chairman and CEO of the insurance giant AIG [USPS]. AIG used to employ Mar Roxas, who in late 1990s tried to resuscitate the ailing insurance industry by imposing unnecessarily strict regulations on the pre-need industry, essentially killing the latter. The bankruptcy of CAP (College Assurance Plan)? Mars moves tremendously benefitted Greenbergs AIG.

Those of you who had to drop out of college because CAP closed down? Blame Roxas and Greenberg. But I am digressing.

Thats just three of the links, but Ill stop at this point because I want to limit this article to 2500 words max.

Most Fil-Am leaders backed the Clinton campaign [Inq]. But among these Fil-Am leaders, the most important and most influential are those who belong to the US-Philippines Society.

Nicolas-Lewis, arguably the most influential Fil-Am in the US, openly and financially supported the Clinton campaign [MT]. Greenberg financially backed Republican Jeb Bushs campaign so its an indication that he dislikes Trump. USPS President John Maisto also openly denounced Trump [WaPo], so thats support for Clinton.

But wait! Theres more.

USPS Chairman John Negroponte
Among the USPS members, the most important is former US Ambassador to Manila John Negroponte, hes taken an interest in the Duterte-era Philippines when he visited the new president in July 2016 [TV5].

What is John Negroponte most (in)famous for?

Negroponte spearheaded the Iran-Contra Affair, which funded Nicaraguan rebels using profits from US arms sales to Iran, with the hope of overthrowing the anti-American Nicaraguan Government [PBS]. This scandal led to the Nicaragua vs US Case in the International Court of Justice, a case that US lost [BostonLaw]. 
SIDE NOTE: Nicaragua vs US is the same case that DLSU Prof. Richard #MayMastersKaBa Heydarian [Quartz] has been using to justify the South China Sea arbitrations US$ 7 million (Php 328 million) price tag [ABS], whose result cannot be enforced for lack of US support [TP: Breaking Away]. Theres a reason why face, brain,  and ""humility"" are three different words.
Sounds familiar? Yes, Negroponte can basically influence Washington to do another Iran-Contra affair, with the Philippines taking Nicaraguas place.

But how influential is he?

He openly endorsed Clinton and Clinton even gushed over that endorsement [Esquire]. Thats how big of a deal his is, as his interventionist philosophy heavily influenced Clintons personal geopolitical policy as she supported US-instigated regime change operations in Libya [FP], Iraq [FP], and Syria [Telegraph]. She has suggested a review of US policy in Syria during the election season, but we all know that its just to assuage the war-weary American public.

Hillary is key to LP interests
As I have explained in the previous sections, US is capable of undertaking foreign intervention, US interests clash with Dutertes, and LP has the necessary connections to make this possible.

But LPs plot to oust Duterte through US support has one vital ingredient: a President Hillary Clinton.

LP knows this full well. Have you observed how LP attack pig Leila de Lima desperately frames her situation as a clash between a woman (thats her) and a misogynistic President Duterte? Have you noticed how the LP-aligned Philippine Daily Inquirer frames the recent VP Leni Knee Joke as a another anti-woman deed by Duterte [Video]? Or how about that Agot Isidro issue [Inq], where the self-proclaimed victim happens to be a woman?

Yes, the #EveryWoman campaign is geared at aligning the Duterte Ouster Plot not only with US interests, but also with Clintons personal crusade for womens rights. This makes a prospective intervention in the Philippines more palatable not only for Clinton, but also for the American Public.

Yes, a President Clinton is important in forwarding LPs political interests.

Too bad Trump won.

But wait! Theres more.

Presidents Duterte and Trump

Duterte issued a statement as soon as news of Trumps win broke out, with Duterte saying he doesn't want to quarrel anymore, because Trump has won [Reuters]. This is a shocking turn of events given Dutertes belligerence towards outgoing US President Barack Obama, best characterized by the formers acerbic language [BBC] that made headlines throughout the world.

What does Trumps win mean for the Dutertes Philippines?

First, Trumps win drastically impedes Duterte ouster plot.
Trumps victory basically cut off the US-Philippines Societys connection with the highest echelon of the American political establishment. USPS supported Hillary with its chairman Negroponte being a Hillary fan, and Trump knows that all too well.

Oh, and just imagine LP pushing for closer US-PH relations with a President Trump in the picture. Schadenfreude galore!

Second, we can expect a less antagonistic US policy in the Philippines.
Even he didnt say it explicitly, Duterte might have anticipated a Trump win. Just a couple of days before the US elections, Duterte appointed Century Properties Group Chairman and CEO Jose E.B. Antonio's as special envoy to Washington for trade, investment and economic affairs [ABS]. Antonio, who owns Trump Tower Manila, is Trumps Philippine partner.

Duterte just executed a masterstroke. Yasay, who probably advised him on the matter, did really well.

Third, warmer US-PH relations translates to a stronger bargaining chip against China.
Yes, we have achieved a dtente between our country and China, but relations still remain strained, as evidenced by the presence of coast guard ships in Panatag Shoal despite the lifting of the fishing ban [Inq]. However, in its bid for global dominance, it is in Chinas interest to turn this dtente into a rapprochement, i.e. make this relationship warmer.

But President Trump  who is potentially far less interventionist than Clinton vis--vis the Philippines  will make it harder for China. Hence, China may decide to woo us a bit more that it intends to. And thats good news for regular Filipinos. Bad news for LP, but good news for the common tao.

I am uncertain as to what a Trump presidency will mean for the United States, but I am fairly confident that a Trump Presidency bodes well for my motherland",RJ Nieto,"November 10, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/11/a-president-trump-good-for-duterte-ph-bad-for.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
TIMELINE: Everything wrong about Mayor Espinosas Death,"CONTROVERSIAL PHOTO Sen. Leila de Lima is shown with suspected drug lord Kerwin Espinosa in this photo taken in March in Baguio City. The senator denies knowing Espinosa and his father. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO / INQUIRER.NET

When Senator Richard Gordon said, ""[Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr.] was already incarcerated and nonetheless [it's] still not safe. Its a slap in the face of the criminal justice system of our country,"" he wasnt wrong. This bears repeating: Gordon is right. Espinosas death is indeed a slap in the face of our countrys criminal justice system.

But before I join the mob condemning this party and that, I feel its just right to evaluate the situation given what we know, so let me do that.


This is how I will do it: I will list down all the major events leading to the Espinosas death. Paragraphs in red contain my observations.

Early August: Duterte vs Espinosa

The wealthy Rolando Espinosa was on his first term as mayor of Albuera Leyte. The Philippine National Police says his son Kerwin is the biggest drug lord in Eastern Visayas.

Late July: Two of Mayor Espinosas bodyguards were arrested in a buy-bust operation after they were found to have 237g of shabu (meth) worth P1.9-million (US$ 39,000) [ABS].

01 August 2016: President Rodrigo Duterte gave Mayor Espinosa 24 hours to surrender. Should Espinosa fail to surrender, a shoot on sight order would be given if he resists and endangers the lives of arresting police officers [GMA].

02 August 2016: PNP Chief Ronald Bato dela Rosa presented Espinosa Sr to the media and announced that Espinosa admitted to his sons involved in the illegal drug trade. Contrary to an Inquirer report, Espinosa Sr did not admit criminal involvement [Philstar], so Dela Rosa cannot arrest Espinosa Sr yet because the outstanding warrant of arrest is for Kerwin instead.
03 August 2016: Albuera Police Chief Jovie Espinido said he has already spoken to Espinosa in July, suggesting that the mayor  donate all his property to charity,  surrender all his firearms and shabu,  resign, and  surrender his son Kerwin [ABS]. Six hired men of arrested Espinosa Sr. were killed during a police operation against illegal drugs in the family compound early in the morning [Inq].

04 August 2016: The PNP was informed that Kerwin Espinosa sent surrender feelers, although no timeline has been set for his surrender. Dela Rosa promised to give Kerwin ""humane treatment"" and that he is even willing to fetch him at the airport once the latter returns to the country. [GMA].

05 August 2016: Kerwin Espinosas alleged right hand man Julito Prak was killed in a police buy-bust operation in Cebu City [GMA]. On the same day, the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) filed drug trafficking charges at the Albuera prosecutors office against both Espinosas [ABS].

06 August 2016: Dela Rosa said that Espinosa Sr. left the White House (dela Rosas residence) after his son, Kerwin, failed to surrender on Friday 05 August. Dela Rosa said that out of pity, he allowed the Espinosas to stay in one of the rooms in the White House. He said the Espinosas wanted to stay at the White House because they do not want to return to their home due to threats and Mayor Espinosa wanted to be there when his son surrenders [GMA].

Duterte indeed ordered Espinosa Sr and son Kerwin Espinosa to surrender in Camp Crame, and Espinosa Sr indeed showed up. However, the fact remains that they cannot be put into custody unless there  an arrest warrant against Espinosa Sr or  Espinosa Sr admitted to a crime. Neither is the case, thats why PNP Chief dela Rosa had to let Espinosa Sr go.

Due process, you know.

For safety, Espinosa Sr wanted to stay in the White House, the PNP Chiefs residence, but he cannot have his cake and eat it too. He didnt turn his son in, he didnt admit complicity to a crime, but he wants extra-special protection. That isnt how it works. Espinosa Sr is a town mayor whose son is a drug lord that has been arrested before on similar charges [Philstar]. Theres no way he could not have known anything about it. 

Mid August: Espinosa Sr is back in Leyte
10 August 2016: A police buy-bust operation in Espinosa Srs home yielded 11 kg of shabu worth P88-million (US$ 1.8 million). The police also discovered bomb-making components in the mayors home [DZRH].

You may want to argue that Espinosa shouldve been arrest right after this, but warrantless arrests can only be performed when in (an arresting officers) presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense [LawPhil].

Neither Espinosa Sr nor Kerwin Espinosa were there during the buy-bust operation, so they cannot be arrested. Moreover, the police cannot just arrest them AFTER the operation because of this same rule on warrantless arrests, i.e. the police had to have an arrest warrant to effect an arrest against the mayor.

11 August 2016: One of Kerwin Espinosas alleged sources of illegal drugs, murder convict Edgar Allen Alvarez, was killed by police in an operation inside a Leyte prison, where he was transferred in 2011. Alvarez was originally detained in the New Bilibid Prison. While in detention, Alvarez allegedly lobbed a grenade that failed to explode, then fired at cops using a 0.45 caliber pistol. The police fired back, killing Alvarez [GMA].

This really sounds fishy. How can a detainee possess a grenade while in prison? But as it turns out, it appears that Alvarez is doing a Colangco-type operation in the Leyte Jail, so the search is not entirely unjustified, so far.

16 August 2016: With no formal charges against him, the Espinosa Sr has gone back to work as Albuera mayor [GMA]. He stayed at the town hall day and night for about a week before he asked for police protection [Sun.Star].
Espinosa Sr has yet to admit criminal involvement and no warrant of arrest was issued against him so what else would he do but go back to Albuera and live his wretched life? Thats exactly what happened.

23 August 2016: PNPs Espinido met with Espinosa Sr in another closed-door meeting at 12:35 pm. Espinosa Sr said hes now willing to cooperate with him for his son's surrender and that he will convince his son to surrender once he calls him [ABS]. At 2:00 PM, Espinosa Sr lawyer Rogelio Bato Jr. was killed in Tacloban, Leyte [ABS].

24 August 2016: Espinosa Sr voluntarily went to the Leyte Provincial Prosecutor's office to execute an affidavit naming his son Kerwin's connections and protector. The mayor admitted getting a lot of death threats [TV5].

25 August 2016: Driven by fear for his life, Espinosa Sr started to hold office in the Albuera Police Station [Sun.Star].

30 August 2016: Espinosa Sr slightly nodded when asked if his affidavit listing his son Kerwins coddlers includes Senator Leila de Lima [Politiko].

31 August 2016: Police said that a senator was in Kerwin Espinosas ledger of drug connections. Espinosa Sr. could not give the names in fear for his familys safety [CNN]. On the same day, Kerwin Espinosa underling Tonypet Zaldivar surrendered to Albuera Police [Inq].

Espinosa Sr was probably horrified after learning about his lawyers murder, and this prompted him to go to the prosecutors office to spill the beans. His request for police protection was most probably granted because hes still a mayor who is entitled to police protection.

Espinosa Sr and Espinido did not explicitly say who that senator is. They have, however, dropped two hints:  Espinosa Srs slight nod when asked if its Sen. Leila de Lima and  Espinidos statement that the senator is a former Justice Secretary [CNN], which basically narrows down the list to either Sen. Drilon ( who was Justice Secretary in 1992) and yes, de Lima.

Whichever is the case, Espinosa Sr has now become a marked man. Its a given that hes certainly a prime target for assassination by those who want to cover their tracks, i.e. those who Espinosa implicated in that affidavit. 

Early September: Espinosa as State Witness?

01 September 2016: Malacaang said it mulls turning Espinosa Sr into a state witness. However, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II on Thursday said Espinosa has yet to apply to be included in the witness protection program of the government. Aguirre said the Department of Justice (DOJ) has yet to receive a formal request from the mayor [Inq]. Espinosa may testify versus a senator, 29 others [MS].

02 September 2016: PNP Region 8 immediately relieves at least 15 Eastern Visayas cops after being implicated by Espinosa Sr in the latters sworn affidavit [Star].

05 September 2016: Espinosa Sr filed a counter-affidavit in the Ormoc Regional Trial Court with the aim to halt the court from issuing a warrant of arrest against the mayor [ABS].

14 September 2016: Albuera PNP Chief Espinido said at least 74 government officials and 154 civilians will face charges for allegedly protecting the illegal drug operation of Kerwin Espinosa, who has been tagged as the biggest drug lord in Eastern Visayas [CDN].

So there are over 200 more people who may want to kill Espinosa Sr before the latter incriminates them further.

19 September 2016: PNP announced that they have just acquired a new state witness who can be used in the prosecution of suspected drug lord Kerwin Espinosa, son of Albuera, Leyte Mayor Rolando Espinosa [CDN].

The Justice Department may have found some value in turning the marked man Espinosa Sr into a state witness. Aguirre has two options on this matter:  use Espinosa Sr to pin Sen Leila de Lima or  ditch the idea and rely on other witnesses so Aguirre can go after Espinosa Sr. I think this is a difficult decision for Aguirre, especially since he has yet to capture any big fish, and Espinosa Sr is a big fish.


With Jumbos surrender, Aguirre can now choose the second option, but Aguirre has not made any subsequent announcements.

23 September 2016: Kerwin Espinosa right hand man Max Miro surrenders to Albuera police, turns over P24 million worth of shabu (US$ 494,000) [CNN].

30 September 2016: Cebu Provincial Police Office (CPPO) Dir. Jose Macanas was relieved from his post amid Espinosa Srs allegations linking him to the illegal drug trade [CDN].

Heres another person who may want to kill Espinosa Sr before the latter incriminates them further. Remember Espinosa Sr has yet to admit complicity so he cannot be arrested sans a warrant.

Early October: The Hunt for Kerwin

01 October 2016: Kerwin Espinosa ex-wife Annalou Llaguno was shot by an unidentified gunman [Sun.Star].

It appears that the evidence cleanup has begun. But on the flip side, Llaguno was also romantically involved with the slain drug lord Alias Jaguar, so we cannot rule out that alternative angle yet.

05 October 2016: Espinosa Sr was arrested then detained at the Leyte Sub-Provincial Jail in Baybay City. Espinosas son Kerwin remained at large, with a source from the Bureau of Immigration saying he flew to Malaysia in June [GMA].

07 October 2016: PNP taps Interpol in hunt for Kerwin Espinosa, who is still at large [Tempo].

12 October 2016: Espinosa pleaded not guilty to the illegal possession of firearms while his lawyer filed a motion to quash, or make the warrant of arrest invalid for his drug case [Sun.Star].


16 October 2016: Abu Dhabi police arrests Kerwin Espinosa [Gulf].

Kerwin cannot be flown back to the Philippine right away because he still has to go through extradition proceedings in the United Arab Emirates.

Late October to Espinosa Srs Death

18 October 2016: Espinosa Sr seeks bail and requests for transfer from the Baybay sub-provincial Jail back to Albuera police station under Chief Insp. Jovie Espenido due to threats to his security. The presiding judge warned Espinosa Srs lawyer Leila Villarino not to again delay proceedings [Inq].

19 October 2016: Espenido links Kerwin Espinosa to drug kingpin Peter Lim [Sun.Star].

24 October 2016: The Philippine Ambassador to the UAE said Kerwin Espinosas extradition proceedings may take up to a month [Abante].

27 October 2016: Whistleblower Sandra Cam said Kerwin Espinosa will name his politician protectors once he is repatriated to Manila [Gulf].

The people mentioned in the Espinosa ledger should be panicking already.

29 October 2016: Ten police officers, including the former provincial police director of Cebu and a policeman still in active service in Cebu City, are undergoing administrative investigation for their alleged links to Kerwin Espinosa [CDN].

29 October 2016: On the same day, Espinosa drug group member Fernando Balagbis was killed during an alleged shootout with policemen who raided his cell in Baybay City Jail in Leyte. A team of policemen went inside his cell early Friday to serve a search warrant[CDN].

03 November 2016: Dela Rosa said Kerwin Espinosa may be repatriated by the second week of November [Abante]. Dela Rosa also said Kerwin Espinosa is key to implicating retired PNP General and Daanbantayan Mayor Vic Loot [Abante].

04 November 2016: Espinosa Sr was killed inside the cell at the Baybay City sub-provincial jail where he was detained after he allegedly fought back against police agents seeking to serve a search warrant for ""illegal firearms"" on him early Saturday morning [TV5].

Lets analyze a bit more.

Kerwin Espinosas Criminal History

Kerwin Espinosa was arrested during a CIDG buy-bust operation on 04 March 2010 [PhilStar], or four months prior to former President Benigno (PNoy) Aquinos oath of office, also four months prior to Sen. Leila de Limas appointment as Justice Secretary.

Interestingly, this Espinosa never appeared on the news for the entire duration of the PNoy presidency. Given that he was able to flee to the UAE in June 2016, I think its clear that charges against him were dropped by the de Lima herself, as she was still the DoJ secretary at the time. You see, those with criminal records are put on the DOJ-Bureau of Immigrations Hold-Departure List, and his ability to fly to the UAE means no pending criminal record exists.


Adding fuel to this theory is the story of murder convict Edgar Allen Alvarez who was originally detained in Bilibid but was then moved to Leyte in 2011, enabling him to become Espinosas illegal drug supplier. This transfer happened under the tutelage of de Limas Justice Department. Did then-Justice Secretary de Lima let go of Espinosa and even provided him with a supplier, or was this a mere coincidence?

Well, take a look at the image below:




Is Kerwin Espinosa and Leila de Lima March 2016 encounter in Baguio City also a coincidence?

Well, Espinosa Sr seems to have mentioned de Lima in the ledger, so I think we have a bit of an idea about the answers here.


So did de Lima and her cohorts have a hand in killing Espinosa Sr?

Espinosa Srs Miscalculations

Mayor Espinosa has been scared for his life since July 2016. He was so scared that he even insisted on staying in the PNP Chiefs residence when he surrendered in early August. The problem, however, is that Mayor Espinosa wanted to have his cake and eat it too.

He wanted extra-special police protection, but he didnt want to turn himself in. Yes, he implicated his son, but he did not implicate himself. Basically, he wanted to stay alive AND evade criminal liability at the same time, even if everybody agrees that hes most likely involved in his sons life of crime.

Espinosa Sr knows his son was arrested on drug charges in 2010. Second, he pleaded not guilty on illegal possession of firearms BUT he simply asked for a quashal on the drug charges, i.e. he wanted the drug charges dropped based on technicality. Why didnt he just say hes not guilty on the drug charges too?

Now, just for the sake of argument, lets assume that Espinosa Sr really has nothing to do with drugs even if its very unlikely.

August reports show his fear is real, so why didnt he just pretend hes guilty and offer to surrender ON THE CONDITION that he will be detained in the Camp Crame or in the NBI detention facility, where he will most likely be out of reach from corrupt policemen who want to silence him before he talks in length? But he did not.

And when he was arrested in early October, why didnt he even attempt to ask for a transfer to Crame or NBI? He was detained in Baybay City in Leyte, well within the reach of the cops he implicated. Has he given up on his life or those of his daughters? Or was he simply not very smart?

Espinosa Sr is a politician, but his inexperience in politics reared its ugly head, with fatal results.

PNP Chief Bato's negligence

I do not blame PNP Chief dela Rosa for his August 2016 decision to evict Espinosa Sr from the White House given the circumstances at the time. I also do not blame him for the delayed arrest of Espinosa Sr, as Bato was just following the rule of law which mandates that he cannot order arrests without a warrant. Yada yada yada.

Heck, I do not even suspect that national government  had Espinosa Sr killed. We all know that Justice Sec. Aguirre is fixated on putting Sen. de Lima behind bars, and eliminating Espinosa Sr, who should know a lot about de Lima's involvement, is a bad idea.

However, whats confusing for me were the events that happened recently.

Espinosa drug group member Fernando Balagbis has been in detention since his January 2016 [PDEA]. He was killed during an October 29 shootout with policemen who raided his cell in Baybay City Jail after the police allegedly received information that he was selling drugs inside the facility [GMA].

At this point, PNP Chief Bato should have rung the alarm bells and see that nothing like this happens again. Given the sensitivity of this case and given that the extrajudicial killings issue has been hounding the Duterte Administration since Day One...

But why the hell did PNP Chief dela Rosa take a vacation at such a critical juncture?

PNP Chief dela Rosa arrived in Las Vegas on November 5 local time, so thats November 4 in the Philippines, i.e. he must have left the Philippines for Las Vegas on or before November 3 [GMA], a couple of days after Balagbis' death and a day before Espinosa Sr's.

Why is he in Vegas? To watch Manny Pacquiao fight later today at 10:00 AM. Yes, PNP Chief Bato took an official leave to watch Manny fight.

Asked to comment about Espinosa Srs death, dela Rosa said he ordered an investigation  while he was still in Las Vegas.

For an issue this critical to the political survival of the Duterte Administration, PNP Chief Bato opted to watch the Manny Pacquiao fight instead of flying back home right away to see what happened.

PNP Chief Bato, I like you, I really do, but our President is already killing himself with his schedule while you, his subordinate, took a vacation.

Think about it. what will the international community say about this?

Maria Ressas Dilemma: Rapplers impending death?,"Throughout the course of my work at ThinkingPinoy, I had opportunities to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes in the mainstream news media world. A number of journalists have been reading my blogs or following me on Facebook, Twitter, and some of them somehow decided to come slightly out of the shadows and contact through Facebook messages, Twitter DMs, emails, or even face-to-face conversations when I met a few in Beijing.

They all have their rants about this journalist and that, but if theres one thing many of them share in common, its an antipathy for Maria Ressa and her brainchild Rappler.

NOTE: I didn't proofread the article anymore. It's not worth the extra time.

I asked them, What with Rappler that makes your blood boil?

Surprisingly, their answers were the same: the arrogance of the Rapplerettes.

Actually, it wasnt that surprising because:
Media people love inventing award giving bodies so they can reward themselves with the same awards they created. With that said, I cant recall any instance where Rappler received any, which kind of suggests how Rappler is viewed by its peers.
I have the same opinion of that organization. More on this later.

Bam Aquino meets Maria Ressa
And just when I thought Ressa cannot possibly spew bullshit at a rate faster than how she (and Rappler) does right now, I heard that her Majesty graced the Senate Session Hall where she served as a resource speaker on a Senate hearing headed by Sen. Bam Aquino [Sun.Star].

I shed tears of laughter as I watched the hearing, mainly because the irony of the entire situation and the hypocrisy of the two persons involved.
First, Bam Aquino himself supported (losing) 2016 presidential candidate Mar Araneta Roxas, who has his own army of trolls that attempted (but sorely failed) to artificially sway public opinion. Roxas even had them trained in an office building within Araneta Center [TP: Internet Army].

Second, heres Ressa decrying the proliferation of online trolls, when her Rappler staff trolls its own readers. Take, for example, how Rappler reporter Paterno Esmaquel mercilessly singled out and publicly humiliated a Rappler reader for a misinformed comment [TP: Cyber Libel]. Another example would be when Rapplers social media moderators reported trolled Anonymous Incorporated just because the latter asked about Rapplers finances (see image below).

Oh, and heres Ressa calling for more ethical behavior when Rappler itself reportedly plagiarized content from Radyo Inquirer [Varsitarian] and TV5 [SpinBusters] before!

But instead of giving more examples (there are lots) of how hypocritical Rappler overlord Maria Ressa is, I think its better if we ask the more important questions:
Ressa has been waging a war against online trolls since her first article-slash-rant about the Weaponization of the Internet debuted on October 04th, so why the sudden passion for the issue?
Trolls have existed even before social media was invented, so why the sudden interest
Is there an extremely pressing problem that Ressa (or Rappler) is dealing with right now?
Heres a quick background

In Whos winning the PH social media wars?, I showed a trend where independent social media players are outperforming mainstream news outlets (incl. Rappler) in terms of Facebook user engagement. With Facebook being the social network of choice for Filipinos, and the declining popularity of TV, radio, and print, I inferred that Rappler and its peers are losing their monopoly in shaping public opinion, as more and more readers gravitate towards Mocha Uson, Sass Rogando Sasot, ThinkingPinoy, and other indie pages.

In The Rise of the Millenial Mosquito Press, I wrote briefly about Rapplers potential revenue figures by estimating the websites ad network revenues. In that article, I showed that Rappler should be well on its way to bankruptcy if it relies on Google Adsense revenues alone, for the reason that Google Adsense, while being the best-paying ad network on the planet, doesnt really pay that much.

And to top it off, I wrote, Rappler is dying because its full of assholes spewing bullshit nonstop [TP: Ressas Pride].
There, I said it: Rappler is dying. But what, exactly, do I mean by dying? After all, when you come to think of it, everyone dies: its just a question of when. And thats what were going to talk about.
Rappler and Maria Ressa

Miguel Miranda of the Southeast Asia Globe interviewed Ressa in 2013. Miranda started the ensuing article with these lines:
Even today, many Filipino journalists are subsumed and consumed by a pervasive sense of irrelevance under social medias shadow. They are often poorly paid and there are constant murmurs of corruption among their ranks [SEA-G].
Miranda then wrote, Rapplers headquarters is neither a cubicle-farm nor a stuffy studio-cum-office. Its staffers and interns attired in business casual are crowded in even rows, typing away at glowing MacBooks.

Let me get this straight: journos in general are paid peanuts but Rapplerettes use ultra-expensive MacBooks, so that means theyre paid well, which also implies that Rapplers operating costs are higher than those of their peers.

And then it gets more interesting, as Ressa details Rapplers revenue streams.

Rapplers Revenue Streams

FIRST, Google ads. Google ads are simple: Rappler is paid a certain amount every time some clicks a google ad and every time 1000 visitors drop by their site. Rappler may use other ad networks, but Google is the one that offers the best returns.

SECOND, Sponsored banners. Companies directly pay Rappler to serve banner ads on their site.

THIRD, Native advertising aka Sponsored Posts. Companies directly pay Rappler to write articles that either directly promote the company or mention the company in a post (i.e. product placement).

FOURTH, Reach. Heres where it gets a bit spooky.

Speaking about Rapplers profitability, Ressa said, With Reach, Rappler can go farther

Rapplers sister, the data science company Reach Social, does a lot of things. However, whats important right now is how Reach Social can make use of the data derived from Rapplers website and its social media accounts.


The usual web analytics data from free-to-use Google and social media Analytics should be part of the stuff that Reach tinkers with, but this kind of data does not provide them much strategic advantage over their competitors because its available to everyone. Thus, Reach Social should have a data source that its competitors have no access to.

What is it? I can think of only two things:  Personal data from social (FB, Twitter, G+) logins and  Rapplers mood meter.
PERSONAL DATA
To comment on Rappler articles or to vote in its mood meter, Rappler asks readers to log in using their Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ account. Rappler gets a users friends list, email address, birthday, and city. I am uncertain as to whether Rappler sells user information to third parties or not, but lets just assume that they dont. After all, its illegal and even if they actually do it, theres no way to find out sans a search warrant.
Check the list of personal info Rappler gets when you authorize social logins.

MOOD METER
The mood meter is far more useful than you think. If Reach Socials data scientists are worth their salt, they can categorize users based on the city they stated on Facebook, which would enable Reach Social to gauge the general mood of a given geographic location in response to a given Rappler article. This is particularly useful for gauging public sentiment on divisive issues, as it allows parties to pinpoint areas where they can focus PR campaigns.
Now, let's ask... 
Is Rappler making money?
In its debut year 2012, Rappler incurred a Php 33.8 million loss against its Php 50 million paid-in capital, and that was incurred in just eight months of operations as Rappler opened only in May 2012 [TV5]. By end of 2012, Rappler badly needed a capital infusion.

Is this why Manny V. Pangilinan was keen in buying a stake in Rappler [Rap]?

With the infusion of new capital Rappler wouldve gone bankrupt by the end of 2013, but it didnt, so I guess someone must have injected the sorority blog with additional seed money.

Now, some camps may argue that it has been a while since 2012, and Rappler shouldve turned a profit by now. That is a very reasonable argument.

But something doesnt add up. Rappler took in two major investors in 2015, the Omidyar Network [TiA] and North Base Media [TiA]. Although I think most Rappler readers will agree that Rappler hasnt really offered anything new.

So what did they use the additional funds for? Just to stay alive?

These pieces of information suggest that Rappler, on its fourth year of operations, has yet to turn a profit.

Hence, Rappler may need to boost its revenue streams as soon as possible so Maria Ressa wont appear to be running a Ponzi Scheme.

BRIEF: A Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors.
The Revenue Streams

As I have explained in a previous article, Google AdSense doesnt pay very well, so it should not be enough to sustain Rapplers operations if the latter were to rely entirely on it [TP: Rappler Dying?]. The second revenue stream, banner ads, have been on the decline as social media rises, according to the New York Times [NYT].

The third revenue stream seems to work terribly too, because it seems that Rapplers sponsored posts do not generate much traffic or interest. Take, their 20 September 2016 ad for Shell Helix Ultra, which managed to gain a whopping SIX  facebook shares as of 03 November 2016. Surely, Shell paying (tens of) thousands of pesos for only six Facebook shares isnt good.


Thus, for Rappler to sustain operations, they should be heavily relying on the fourth revenue stream: Reach Social.

Thus, Rappler needs to achieve two things: increase website traffic and social media engagement.


Rapplers Site Traffic
In fairness to Rappler, their website traffic has increased relatively quickly over the years, peaking at 23 million hits in May 2016 [R2T]. Thats a seriously gigantic figure. Rapplers traffic slightly decreased in July and August 2016 at around 21 million users per month [R2T], but that can be attributed to the reality that the public may not be as interested in the news because the May 2016 elections are over.

Whats shocking, however, is a mind-boggling 25 percent dip in traffic from September to October. More specifically, Rappler received 21 million visitors in the month preceding 16 September 2016, then it received only 15 million in the month preceding 16 October 2016 [R2T].

I tried to find a good reason why this happened, so I checked the web analytics tool Alexa for clues.


Looking at the figure above, I was shocked to see that on 25 September 2016, Rapplers global traffic ranking fell by almost 5,000 places from 1314th to 6236th OVERNIGHT[Alexa]. Sure, a lot of people dislike Rappler, but the sites traffic rankings cannot fall by that much overnight.

I was searching for the web and I discovered that Google rolled out Penguin 4.0 on 23 September 2016. Penguin 4.0 is an update on its core algorithm that changes how google ranks search results. Google suggested that the impact of Penguin 4.0 could take time, as they re-crawl the entire web, especially deep links [Moz], so Rappler might have felt its full impact on 25 September 2016, when its ranking fell drastically.


SIDE NOTE: In one of her article-rants, Ressa accused Duterte supporters of gaming Facebooks newsfeed algorithms [TP: Mosquito Press]. Now, Penguin 4.0 penalizes websites that use dubious schemes to manipulate search rankings [SEW]. Seeing that Rappler got hit very badly, did Ressa accuse Duterte supporters of something that she herself does?

From the same Alexa records, we can see that Rappler somehow recovered its rankings a week or two later, but it appears that since its recovery, Rapplers site ranking is steadily going down again.

Now, thats bad for Rapplers first three revenue streams, so how about the other one?

Rapplers Social Media Engagement 
Rappler is social media engagement figures has been dropping drastically too. Screenshots of Facebook Page Insights from August, September, and October show its losing against independent social media players, while the last one, taken yesterday and shown below, shows that it has finally reached abysmal levels of user engagement:


If I were a company who wants data science services rooted on social media expertise, would I seriously get help from Rapplers Reach Social when the fact of the matter is that they suck at social media themselves?

Of course not. And that is really, really, really bad for Rapplers fourth and remaining revenue stream.

Rappler, the Social News Network

Rappler describes itself as a social news network, so it has to have a pretty good understanding of how online social interactions work, right? But why does it fail so badly in social media?

In the same 2013 interview with SEA Global, Ressa said, So many studies show that 80% of the decisions people make in their lives are based on what they feel, on their emotions, Ressa said, Its true in real life. The internet only magnifies it.

Ressa apparently failed to tell this to her Rapplerettes because just several weeks ago, a petite bourgeoisie Rappler moderator lashed out on a reader with: Ngayon, kung gutom ka, huwag ka dito mag-alburoto (Now, if youre starving, dont vent your frustration here.)


Now, lets ask: How did Ressas Rapplerettes make their readers feel?

But no! Ressa believes they did no wrong. She even went as far as launching its #NoPlaceForHate campaign, a campaign that sorely failed because  its hypocritical so people generally dismissed it as hogwash, and  Rapplers weakening social media presence failed to provide it traction.

Simply put, Rappler is the anti-social social news network, and I guess you know what happens to things like that.

Yes, Rappler can change for the better, but while Ressa is busy practicing her time-tested assholery, independent social players are lapping up their subscriber base, assuming that Rappler still has any left.

At this point, I feel that its too late for Rappler, but who knows? Miracles do happen.

Genius! The Method to Dutertes Foreign Policy Madness,"Sun Tzus Art of War states, Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt [UCSD].


Now that much of the foreign policy dust has settled, I think its time to explain the method to Dutertes foreign policy madness of the past several months.

Both foreign and local political commentators have described Philippine President Rodrigo Dutertes foreign policy as uncertain [Reuters]. Even former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, a sell out, has described the maverick mayors foreign policy as difficult to comprehend [GMA].

I think I agree with the Philippine Stars Edith Regalado when she said that Duterte keeps people guessing on foreign policy [Star].

I think the best way to understand Dutertes strategy is by taking the term foreign policy realignment to heart. Instead of thinking about Dutertes policy as a series of tweaks to a mostly a pro-American Philippines, we need to examine his actions as an emancipation from American control.

No, we cannot possibly be free from American influence, but yes, we can be free from American control.

Duterte on America
Duterte has made it very clear that he feels that the Philippines has historically received the shorter end of the stick in its relations with the United States. This not without justification.

Right after we gained independence after the Second World War, the Americans, with the support of Pres. Manuel Roxas and the Liberal Party-controlled Philippine Congress, passed the Bell Trade Act. This Philippine Law gave Americans economic rights equal to that of local citizens [Shalom 1980], to the disadvantage of Filipinos. After Roxas' suddenly death, his successor Quirino, also from the Liberal Party (LP), simply continued whatever Roxas Pro-American policy was.

Through the Bell Trade Act, the US enjoyed zero tariffs on its exports to the Philippines, which is what the US demanded in exchange for war reparations [Schermer 1987, p.94]. The Bell Trade Act greatly damaged the local economy as our imports exceeded our exports, making us heavily dependent on loans and foreign aid to finance the gap [SONA 1959].
The 1950s was the height of the Second Red Scare in mainland US. Fearing a communist takeover by Central Luzons Hukbalahap, an insurgency that the Liberal Party-led national government failed to quell, the United States decided to actively catapult populist leader Ramon Magsaysay to the presidency, shielding him from the dangers associated with antagonizing reelectionist Quirino.

Magsaysay really had a heart for the people, and he instituted reforms that would have otherwise been impossible under any other president at the time. The US, however, was concerned only about the Huks rebellion. Thus, US support for Magsaysay since 1950 virtually evaporated overnight in 1954, after Magsaysays successful suppression of the communist Huks [Lembke 2001, p. 85-87].

And we all know how Magsaysay died shortly thereafter.

It'd take days to enumerate and elaborate every single lopsided deal that the Philippines got, so lets fast forward to the 2010s, where we heard yet another remix of the same old tune.

The South China Sea Arbitration
In 2011 and prior to the filing of the arbitral case, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US will honor its treaty obligations to the Philippines [Inq].

Clinton was referring to the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty.

In 2012, asked on whether the US will aid us if we were attacked at Scarborough Shoal, Foreign Sec.. del Rosario responded, They have expressed that they will honor their obligations under the mutual defense treaty [NYTimes].

In 2013, the US State Sec. Chuck Hagel emphazised the importance of the Philippines as a treaty ally and reaffirmed the United States commitment to the Mutual Defense Treaty [Inq].

In a 2014 press statement, US State Department spokesperson Marie Haff reiterated Americas support for the Philippines in the latters arbitration case against China [DoS].

In 2015, US President Barack Obama said, [T]he United States supports the Philippines decision to use arbitration under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to peacefully and lawfully address differences [FSI].

Alright, I believe its clear that the US affirmed military support for us for all of the five years preceding 2016. And then the time came for the Americans to keep true to their word.

On 05 July 2016, Chinese state-run broadsheet Global Times editorial entitled Power game decides post-arbitration order warned of military conflict in the South China Sea should the United States intervene in the South China Sea after the arbitral award [GT].
The arbitral award, which favored the Philippines, was released on July 12. A few hours later, the US State Department Deputy Spokesperson said this decision can and should serve as a new opportunity to renew efforts to address maritime disputes peacefully [DoS].

The Americans chickened out, so Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was stuck between a rock and a hard place.

In response, Duterte pursued a solution along the lines of the old adage, If you cant beat them, join them.

Realignment Step 1: Talk to the Chinese Government 
Every political analyst worth his or her salt have expected this scenario: theres just no way the US will risk the current world order just for the Philippines sake.

Duterte and his people knew this long before that fateful day.

On 17 May 2016 or just a few days the elections, Duterte met with Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua in Davao City. After the meeting, the Ambassador said, We had a very good conversation The Chinese side is looking forward [to work with] him and his team to further enhance our bilateral relationship [MS].

The operative word here is bilateral, i.e. involving two parties, i.e. direct PH-China talks. This is in stark contrast with the Aquino Administrations call for multilateral talks, which includes ASEAN countries, something that China blatantly rejected the whole while [WSJ].

On that same day, Duterte managed to gain a certain level of trust from the Chinese Government, something that's totally absent during the Aquino Regime.

So far, so good. But thats just step one. Even if China is a communist-authoritarian country, the fact remains that public opinion is still a factor in government decision making.

Civil unrest, you know, so Duterte proceeded with step two.

Realignment Step 2: Hedge to the last minute
Duterte still chose to hedge his bets up to late June. He wanted to make sure that he fully understands the United States real stance on the South China Sea issue before he crosses the point of no return or in his own words, before he crosses the Rubicon.

And being the brutally frank leader that he is, Duterte asked US Ambassador Goldberg on 21 June 2016, Are you with us or are you not with us?, and Goldberg responded that the U.S. would only support the Philippines if it was attacked [AC].

Well, thats the problem. 

Duterte want no bloodshed, despite the calls of the opposition for a bloodier stance. Goldbergs reply, while reassuring at first glance, actually implies that the US will not help enforce the arbitral decision, because the Philippines has yet to be attacked. Basically, the US will wait for one of us to die first before they take action. For Duterte, that isn't good enough.

Yes, the US chickened out. The ambassador showed that the US definitively chickened out. Duterte, along with Foreign Sec. Yasay and Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, probably knew about how Goldberg will respond: they wanted to catch the fish by the mouth.


Now that Duterte has made it clear to him and to the Filipino public that the US wont be there to help, he proceeded to step three.

Realignment Step 3: Say Hello to the Chinese Public
Duterte was generally silent from the meeting with Goldberg up to his inauguration but

While all these were happening, Chinese state-owned media has started to soften its anti-Filipino rhetoric. In as early as 25 May 2016, the Global Times published an surprisingly optimistically-worded report saying that some local Filipino journalists are trying to bridge the PH-China gap [GT]. Several days later, Chinese state-owned Xinhua News reported Duterte government may reopen door to China-Philippines dialogue [GT].

Then came 23 June 2016, or two days after the Duterte-Goldberg meeting, where the Global Times editorial stated, Although overshadowed by a political standoff, both countries are actually becoming increasingly complementary in economic terms [GT].

Yes, the Chinese Government is starting to make the Chinese public to be more receptive of the incoming Duterte Administrations foreign policy efforts. At this point, Duterte has already gained some trust from the Chinese Government. However, having the Chinese Governments ear and having the Chinese Publics are two different things.

Anti-Filipino rhetoric flooded Chinese media for years as a result of the arbitration case. Despite the recent barrage of pro-Filipino news on the mainland, its still safe to say that anti-Filipino sentiment in the mainland runs high.

Duterte had to find a way to quickly and effectively tell the Chinese Public that hes really serious about striking a truce, and hopefully before July 12th decision, the time when the angry Chinese Public may start asking for his head.


What did Duterte do? A series of calculated actions.

On 30 June 2016, after an eerie foreign policy silence since the Goldberg meeting, RTV Malacaang accidentally aired a sensitive portion of Dutertes first cabinet meeting, where Duterte said on live TV he doesnt want to put the country in an awkward position [Xinhua].

A day later, Duterte reportedly said, If we can have peace (with China) by just talking I'll be really happy [Xinhua]. Another day later, China Daily reported that (Duterte) told a Cabinet meeting not to flaunt a ruling if it is favorable, and said there should be a soft landing in disputes with China [NJU].

Chinese media, with a bit of help from Duterte, was basically building up the old man's image as a peacemaker.

Realignment Step 4: A more definitive Hello
You may notice that all the references I used in the previous paragraph are Chinese websites. Thats because I want to point out that both Chinese and Philippines governments are trying their best to make the latters image more palatable for the mainland. But that isnt enough: Duterte has to make sure that the Chinese People get the impression that hes sincere about his intentions and that he is not hedging anymore.

To the horror of the Americans and to the delight of the Chinese, Duterte on 09 July 2016 said the US imported terrorism [Xinhua-GT], sending shockwaves throughout the the world. We can debate on that claim, but whats clear is that Duterte sent a message to the Chinese public that he will burn bridges with America.

As to whether hell actually burn bridges is another story: all he needs to do right now is make the Chinese public like him more.

Then came arbitral decision on 12 July 2016, and Duterte kept true to his word [TP: Yasays Face].

So far, so good. For better or for worse, Duterte is a 21st century populist Machiavelli.

Realignment Step 4: Tirades and more tirades
To mend ties, Duterte had to visit China after the arbitral award: theres no question about it. But he cannot visit just yet because the decision is still a hot topic on both Chinese and Philippine Media. It had to die down first.

To accelerate the process, Duterte capitalized on his massive political capital  a 91 percent July trust rating  to condition the minds of Filipino, to make them more receptive to China. He talked about China donating drug rehabilitation centers [Reuters], he mentioned our need for peace, and he even had the balls to joke about it during one of his speeches while in front of Ambassador Zhao.
On the Chinese front, Duterte endeared himself to the Chinese public by launching more tirades against the United States. This includes the son of a b*tch comment against Obama, which led to the cancellation of their meeting [DailyMail]. This includes Dutertes reminder of the Bud Dajo Massacre [Sun.Star]. And he even told Obama to go to hell [AP].

Realignment Step 5: A nuanced realignment
While at it, Duterte understands that he cannot be too pro-China because:
it will surely alienate us from Japan and the West and that's realllllllly bad.
such a relationship puts us at risk of leaving a master (Americans) for another master (Chinese)
it may alienate us from some of our ASEAN neighbors like Vietnam (which has territorial disputes with China [Forbes]) and Singapore (whos trying to balance its relations with China and the United States [Time]).
So how did Duterte solve this?

He spoke with his ASEAN neighbors one by one before going to China.

SINGAPORE: In early September, Duterte spoke with Singaporean PM Lee Hsien Loong during the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane [ST]. I think its safe to say that he basically told Lee what Lee needed to hear so that Lee wont freak out over the China visit.


INDONESIA: After the ASEAN summit, Duterte then visited Indonesia [CNN], and he must have done the same thing he did with the Singaporean PM, especially since Indonesia is neutral-to-negative per the Natuna Islands issue [Guardian].

VIETNAM: In late September, Duterte visited Vietnam, whos at odds with China over the Paracel Islands, i.e. our neighbor with a problem thats similar to ours [Reuters]. Its safe to say that he must have assured Vietnam that he will be taking a path thats similar to Vietnam, and not totally sell his country out to the Chinese. That should assuage any fears that Vietnam may be holding up to that point.

LAOS, CAMBODIA, MYANMAR, and THAILAND are mostly pro-China, so theres little to explain to them.

Last two to talk to: Brunei and Malaysia.

MALAYSIA: Duterte wanted to visit Malaysia in August [GMA] but Malaysian PM Najibs vow to defend Sabahs sovereignty [Diplomat] probably forced both parties to postpone the meeting. Duterte announced recently that he will visit Malaysia this month, calling the visit as part of a tour of countries that matter [AsiaOne].

BRUNEI: And theres Brunei, where Duterte was supposed to be on 04 September but the vist was postponed to mid-October because of the Davao Blast [Star].

Anyhow, Duterte basically managed to reassured his ASEAN neighbors that everythings gonna be fine.

Off to China!

Realignment Step 6: Duterte flies to Middle Kingdom
This part wont be very lengthy. You're probably already very familiar with this.
I think Dutertes late October State Visit delighted the Chinese public, as the Philippine delegation was treated in the warmest, friendliest way possible.

I was there, watching the meetings and monitoring Chinese social media. I saw it myself.

And to top it off, the Chinese pledged $24 billion in investments to the Philippines, which is arguably the most generous offer ever given to the Philippines in any single state visit since 1896.

Oh, and did I mention that a week after the visit, Chinese ships are nowhere to be seen in Scarborough Shoal [ABC]? Yes, Filipino fishermen can finally go there!


But theres one more nagtatampo country that we havent dealt with: JAPAN.

Realignment Step 7: Ohayo Nippon!
The overwhelmingly successful Chinese State visit probably made the Japanese very jittery, so the timing of the State Visit to Japan, which is just a few days after his China visit, is just about right.

Duterte reassured Japanese PM Shinzo Abe that his deals with China are purely economic, and that no military deals were struck [Philstar], which is basically what Japan wanted to hear.

The Wall Street Journal even reported that he spoke soothingly [WSJ], an adjective that, in my recollection, has never been used to describe Dutertes rhetoric.

You probably got the point by now.

Suffice it to say, Japan was reasonably pleased and reasonably, given the situation at large, is good enough.

Realignment far from over
These are just the first several steps in Dutertes foreign policy realignment. The State Visit to China, while a resounding success, is just the first stage towards rebuilding PH-China ties.

There are still many more things to do, things that I still do not know of, things that I have yet to understand. Heck, I don't even understand all the intricacies of the seven steps I mentioned.

Nevertheless, one thing is clear: Duterte, using only his acid tongue, managed to turn the tables against the United States. The US is now on the defensive, and Goldbergs recent interview with Karen Davila is a testament to that.

In that interview, the ambassador said, I know, that Senator Cayetano, President Dutertes running mate, made an unpublicized trip to China in June along with Secretary Tugade [ABS].

In fairness, Goldberg did not explicitly insinuate any wrongdoing on the part of Senator Cayetano or Tugade. However, such a comment is in direct defiance of diplomatic protocol, where foreign diplomats are not supposed to publicly comment on such issues. I think this is plenty clear as Senator Cayetano has consequently requested the DFA to protest Goldbergs actions [Star].

The conformity of Goldbergs actions to established diplomatic protocol is not my concern. Instead, it is the underlying reasoning behind his words.

Obama, to be replaced by either Clinton or Trump, is on the way out of the White House. Goldberg, to be replaced by Sung Kim, is on the way out of Manila [Star].
What tactical or strategic benefit is there for the United States if Goldberg manages to piss off the Duterte Administration when the former is about to leave Manila anyway?
There are two possible explanations:

Goldberg is frustrated at how things turned out, i.e. he failed on his mission; or, 
The United States is hedging its bets in anticipation of the November US Elections.

One on hand, we have a lame duck president Obama who has pretty much lost his foreign influence as the international community await the results of the November 2016 US Elections. On the other hand, we have an incoming US President who will get to dictate American foreign policy for the next four (or even eight) years.

Yes, I think the US simply doesn't want to look like a sissy.
The Goldberg Rationale
Goldbergs belligerence towards that Duterte administration serves as a counterweight to the potentially hyper-diplomatic approach of his successor, Ambassador to the Philippines-Designate Sung Kim, who most probably knows how to massage egos given his stint as special representative for North Korea policy [CNN].

With the Goldberg controversy, the new US president can try to provide the Philippines a counter-offer without looking too weak and submissive, two adjectives that a hegemon should be allergic to.

Outgoing Ambassador Philip Goldberg (L) and Incoming Ambassador Sung Kim (R)
Now, Duterte said a Russia visit is possible, and possible means its not certain. Duterte basically dropped a clue for the Americans to pick up. That is, he is saying that his State Visit to Russia depends on how the new US president  may it be Clinton or Trump  will respond.

I never knew that Duterte and his cabinet can be this shrewd, that they can be this smart.

Some camps may argue that I am giving them too much credit, but remember: this is the same government that managed to avoid a Third World War [NatInt] without spilling a single drop of blood.

#HindiTama: Rodrigo Duterte vs the Philippine Daily Inquirer,"GMA News recently introduced the #HindTama project, which purportedly ""aims to put in check some of the viral hoaxes that spread on social media [GMA]."" However, I cannot help but wonder they needlessly limited their scope when they could have covered mainstream media itself, especially those cases when mainstream media men engage in unethical practices,

I am not sure of GMA knows how to do this, so let me teach them how.


In An Analysis of Rapplers Rodrigo Dutertes 386 P. Guevarra Property, I showed how failing to get the other side of the story results in cataclysmic levels of misinformation. In this article, I explained how the sorority blog Rappler came up with a conspiracy theory based solely on a document from an unidentified source, when it couldve easily been counter-checked with a simple phone call to the Duterte camp. But thats Rappler: my expectations are not very high.

But I did not expect the three-decade-old Philippine Daily Inquirer to do the same thing.
Nikko Dizon and the Chinese Companies
On 25 October 2016, the Inquirers Nikko Dizon published the controversial article Chinese company banned by World Bank bags PH infrastructure project [Inq], where it accused the government of two things:
The Duterte Government awarded contracts to companies blacklisted by the World Bank
The Duterte Government awarded contracts without following procurement laws.
The article, at face value, is pretty damning for the Duterte-led National Government. Why would someone who won on an anti-corruption platform award contracts to companies with dubious reputations and in contravention with procurement laws?

But theres a catch: the Inquirer did not contact the government before they published this article. That is, the Inquirer did not bother to ask anyone from the government about this prior to the articles publication. This is confusing for regular Filipinos like me, considering that they have correspondents in the Malacaang Press Corps.

The Inquirer even has direct access to Presidential Communication Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar, who writes a column for them.

Thats really odd.

Government Rebuttal
As it turns out, the article fell flat on its face after the government commented about the issues.

Two days later on 27 October 2016, Inquirers Dizon published a follow-up article entitled Just memos, contract, with Chinese firm, says BCDA [Inq], where BCDA said the documents signed in Beijing were just MoUs, or Memorandums of Understanding between the Chinese Companies and their Philippine counterparts.

BCDA Chief Vince Dizon (no relation to the Inquirer reporter) even castigated the Inquirer for neglecting to counter-check its October 25 story. He also said that MoUs are by no means an award of contract.
According to the The Law Society of Singapore, an MoU is generally considered an agreement to agree or an agreement to enter into a more specific and comprehensive contract or agreement at a later time after further negotiations. Furthermore, MOUs are expressed to be not contractually binding. This is because the courts will generally not recognize agreements to enter into contracts, as contracts in their own right [LSSG].

In short, MoU do not violate procurement laws because they simply are generic agreements to cooperate. MoUs do not set up the specific terms of a project contract (e.g. specific project cost), terms that are necessary for the government to award project contract.

Nikko Dizons article would have had a drastically less accusatory tone had the reporter bothered to ask the government about it... but she didnt.

In short, iyong sinulat ni Nikko na October 25 article ay pambalot lang ng tinapa and nothing more.

The BCDA chief threw a sarcasm bomb at Nikko Dizon when the former said he admired the diligence of the Philippine Daily Inquirer then suggested that the same diligence should have been exercised in simply reading the MOU that was signed.

Fair enough, I think. But then, if Nikko Dizon was so good at research, why did she miss reading the actual MoUs? Surely, an organization as well-funded as hers should be able to get hold of such.

It appears that her secret may be Facebook.

Luis Abad on October 23
On 23 October 2016 or two days prior to Dizons first article, a certain Luis Abad published three consecutive publicly-visible Facebook status posts [FB1, FB2, FB3] that listed issues regarding the Chinese companies involved in the $24 billion worth of investment pledges that the Duterte Government helped snag in its recent State Visit to Beijing China.
One of Abad's Facebook posts
Starting with the statement And the wheeling and dealing begins? The China List raises more concerns, Abad asked several rhetorical questions that can be summed up into the following points:
Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) may have awarded a contract to China Harbour Engineering Co (CHEC) despite the latters involvement in bribery and corruption controversies in 10 countries, and its being blacklisted by the World Bank.
Romero-owned Manila Harbour may have been allowed to do further reclamation work on Manila Bay despite lack of NEDA and DENR approval.
Romero-owned Mega Harbour Port and Development Inc may have flouted procurement laws when it was allowed to develop the Davao and Cebu ports.
Cavitex and ICTSI may have been illegally allowed to develop Sangley Point, which is still AFP property.
Two Chinese companies  China Road and Bridge Corp (CRBC) and Yangtse Motor Group  may have been awarded transportation-related contracts without proper bidding, and that CRBC was involved in bribery and corruption controversies in four countries.
Sinotech has also been involved in bribery and corruption issues.
Zonar Systems was also cited, but only in light of the absence of readily-available information regarding the bidding processes.
This is pretty long list. But to sum it all up, Abads questions revolve around two things:  regulatory compliance on the bidding process and  dubious company reputations.

This sounds awfully similar to the Dizonss article, which revolves around the same two core issues.

Res ipsa loquitur
Nikko Dizons failure to ask for BCDAs position might be a classic case of journalistic incompetence, i.e. it was an honest accident. However, Dizon is an experienced reporter who must be very aware of allegations of bias against the Inquirer so she shouldve taken every step to dispel that notion.

But she didnt.

Was the issue an accident, or is Nikko Dizon biased herself?
A closer look at the Inquirers articles content shows that it raised EVERY point that Abad raised. Lets list down items in the October 25 Inquirer article that correspond to the Abads seven points:
CHECs partnership with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA)
The Manila Harbour Center reclamation
CCCC Dredgings contract with Cebus Mega Harbour Port
Cavitex in Sangley Point
CRBCs contract with BCDA
SinoHydros bribery and corruption issues (SinoHydro is a SinoTech subsidiary [Sino])
For a Pasig River Project, Zonar Systems was mentioned along with Sinohydro.

CAMC engineering was the only company mentioned in the Inquirer article that did not appear in any of Abads three posts.

Such a detailed Inquirer article could not have matched those posts by pure coincidence.


I am not accusing Dizon of plagiarism but I am confused as to why Dizon would pick up such leads without counter-checking when her likely source is a Liberal Party Stalwart.
Luis Abads father is former Aquino Budget Secretary Florencio Butch Abad, his mother is Liberal Party Vice President for Policy Henedina Abad, and he also was the former chief of staff of Aquinos Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima [OGP].
But theres something more confusing here: The Philippine Daily Inquirer is a member of the Philippine Press Institute, whose Code of Ethics states [PPI]:
All efforts must be exerted to make stories fair, accurate and balanced. Getting the other side is a must, especially for the most sensitive and critical stories. The other side must run on the first take of the story and not any day later.
So why didnt the Inquirers Dizon get the other side? Is she a Liberal Party loyalist herself?

Inquirers Editorial Team
Truth be told, I am disturbed about how such a story can get past the lower-tier Inquirer editors, but I am not surprised that it got past Inquirer.net Editor-in-Chief John Nery [Nery].

Why? Because Nery appears to have actively defended Senator Leila de Lima of the Liberal Party [LATimes], and because he allowed the creation, publication, and the continuous expansion of the journalistic travesty that is the Inquirers Kill List[TP: Kill List].

The PPIs Code of Ethics also advises against conflicts of interests, which  occur when individuals face competing loyalties: to a source or to their own self-interest, or to their organizations economic needs, as opposed to the information needs of the public [PPI].

I think the conflict of interest here is economic in nature, as the Inquirers owners have a score to settle with President Duterte.

First, Benjamin Philip Romualdez, husband of Inquirer heiress Sandy Prieto [TV5], is the president of the Chamber of Mines [CoM], and we all know Dutertes crackdown on illegal mining operators [Inq].

Second, Dennis Valdes, husband of another Inquirer heiress Tessa Prieto [Pep], was the president of PhilWeb when Dutertes refusal to renew Philwebs contract resulted into its closure [Star].

Yes, we are talking about billions of  pesos' worth of potential (or realized) economic losses for the Rufino-Prietos as a result of Duterte's pro-people policies.

Conflicts of interest: this is what GMA News can call #HindiTama.",RJ Nieto,"October 29, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/10/hinditama-rodrigo-duterte-inquirer-china.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
The Hilarity of the Anti-Mocha Uson Petition,"A Change.org petition initiated by a certain Paul Quilet is calling for the suspension of the Mocha Uson Blog Facebook Page.
The petitions description reads:
Mocha Uson, a Filipino entertainer-turned-Duterte die-hard supporter uses her Facebook page to spread fictitious and false information about pressing issues in the Philippines, from the role the USAID plays in the country to circulating malicious and false news concerning other government officials, eliciting unwarranted hate from the public. These Facebook posts widens the rift between those who support the current administration and those who are critical of it.
The said petition has garnered 19,819 supporters as of 9:11 AM GMT+8, 24 October 2016.

I categorically refuse to sign the petition because I think its hilarious. Let me tell you why.
First, aint it hypocritical?
Whether Quilet wants to admit it or not, The Mocha Uson Issue is about Duterte supporters led by Mocha Uson versus Liberal Party supporters led by who-gives-a-shit. Now, suppose this petition succeeds in getting Mocha suspended, where will her 4 million Facebook followers go? Surely, it wont be to any of those Yellow Pages like Juan Nationalist, Cynthia Patag, etc.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer even joined the lets-suspend-mocha fray when its editor allowed the publication of Olivia Estradas The days of the Mocha Uson Blog are now numbered, where Estrada wrote, Uh-oh. Our best to Mocha (well, no, not really) but it looks like people are going in for the jugular on this one.

Its quite ironic that the people who decried Marcos era suppression of free speech, which includes the Inquirers founders, are the same ones who want to suppress free speech today. Freedom of Speech applies to everyone, and not just those whose opinions you agree with.

I used to be appalled by Yellows and their hypocrisy. Now, I am just amazed at their futile tenacity.
Second, what rule did Mocha break?
Free speech is guaranteed in the constitution. Sans a court conviction, the presumption of innocence allows Mocha to exercise this right whenever she pleases. For a group that loves rubbing Rule of Law onto everyones faces, I find their members selective memory.

Furthermore, a closer look at Facebooks Community Standards show that Mocha did not violate anything either. The community standards are grouped into four: Helping to Keep you Safe, Encouraging Respectful Behavior, Keeping your account and personal information secure, and Protecting your intellectual property. Of these four categories, Encouraging Respectful Behavior is the nearest thing that Mocha couldve violated.
The section covering Encouraging Respectful Behavior states, please keep in mind that something that may be disagreeable or disturbing to you may not violate our Community Standards. That is, this section outlaws only Nudity, Hate Speech, and Violance & Graphic Content [FCS].

As far as I know, its the yellows who constantly slut-shame Mocha by posting her nude pics online. So, if someone violates the community standards, itd be the same people who are petitioning for her suspension.

Ah! The Irony.

Third, itll backfire.
Suppose that these idiots somehow manage to get Mochas page suspended or deleted, do they seriously think that thats a win for them? I think not, because it will backfire big time. For one, Mocha can just create a new page and her 4 million followers will simply follow it.

Now, suppose Mocha gets banished from Facebook. Do these lamebrains seriously believe that thats it? No. Mochas followers will instead go to other Duterte-aligned pages, making these pages more formidable and visible.
I am telling you this right now: you will not want MindaNation, Sass Rogando Sasot, or Thinking Pinoy get as much engagement as Mochas Page. Trust me, it is in your best interest to keep Mocha afloat.

Moreover, if Change.org petitions can be used to get Facebook Pages suspended, what made these jaundiced assholes think that only they can use Change.org? If Change.org can actually influence Facebook moderators to disable accounts, then a post-Mocha scenario would be more disastrous for the Yellow sympathizers than for Duterte supporters.

There are far more Duterte supporters online than LP sympathizers. With our heavily-engaged followers, It wouldnt be very difficult to muster a few hundred thousand signatures to eliminate every single anti-Duterte page or Facebook profile out there.

Let me cut this long story short: if Mocha gets banned because of the petition, you can expect every anti-Duterte page to get banned too. That would be interesting, because it will cost you guys a lot of money to regain your followers [TP: Internet Army], as opposed to us (especially Mocha Uson) who can just create new pages and wait for likes to quickly come in. 

Social Media: New battleground
Social Media has become the primary political battleground today. It has democratized information on a scale that has never been seen before. Case in point: Facebook made Duterte win.

The Duterte social media phenomenon was no short-term fad: Ive been constantly checking Facebook Page Insights Data since August 2016 and I have seen how independent Social Media Pages are outperforming mainstream media organizations in terms of user engagement.


Lets just take a look at Facebook Page Insights stats from 11:00 PM of 24 October 2016, as shown in the image below:
The image above lists all the major Philippine news agencies and independent Political Facebook pages, along with their respective likes, number of posts, and user engagement.

Mochas nigh-indomitable influence
In terms of Facebook likes, Mocha Uson pales in comparison to news giants ABS-CBN and GMA. But likes are not the end of the story. Whats more important is engagement, which is the number of times people gave a damn about posts on a page.

In terms of user engagement, Mocha equals that of ABS-CBN and GMA combined, and she easily surpasses everyone else by over 100%. Needless to say, with her 4 million super-engaged followers, Mocha Uson has become more politically influential than ANYONE else in Philippine media today.

Truth be told, Mocha can even easily win THREE congressional party-list seats  the maximum number  if she decides to form a party for the 2019 elections, as three seats will require a lot fewer than four million votes. She probably won't run (I hope not), but the fact remains that this is how influential she has become. 

And this is what mainstream media, the petite bourgeoisie, and their oligarchic benefactors are so scared of. And no amount of assholery will get them out of this rut.",RJ Nieto,"October 25, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/10/the-hilarity-of-anti-mocha-uson-petition_25.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
BBM vs Leni: Why LP needs to assassinate Duterte soon,"Just when I felt that Bongbong Marcos political relevance has started to fade away after the May 2016 loss, I suddenly realized that that the late dictators son has a crucial role to play in todays Political Game of Thrones.

DISCLAIMER: I am not saying that this actually is LP's plan. What I am saying is that this is the model of future events that best fits my current understanding of the situation. Nothing more, nothing less.

Its 3:00 AM of October 17th and Duterte is still in Brunei. He will be arriving here in China on the 18th, so I do not expect anything to happen today. Im in my Beijing hotel room, restlessly trying to figure out how to pass the time. Then I remembered the Reuters news article featuring ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.

International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda [Reuters] recently, warned the newly-installed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte of possible ICC action, as she explained that ICC may have the jurisdiction to prosecute perpetrators of thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings in the Philippines' crackdown on drugs.

The Senate Hearings
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has been hounding President Rody Duterte with allegations of extrajudicial killings since 2009 [TP: Ooh, Ronnie]. Seven years later in 2016, they still havent managed to file a case with probable cause [TP: Wikileaks]. Even de Lima admitted in August that they have not been able to file cases against Duterte since 2009 because of lack of evidence [TP: Ronnie].
In a bid to resurrect the issue, Sen. Leila De Lima brought witness Edgar Matobato into the limelight, and we all know how big of a dud Matobato turned out to be. Just look at how de Lima lost her sh*t when someone blew Matobatos cover:

Matobato turned out to be a dud. And with Matobato being central to de Limas case against Duterte, the senate investigation of extrajudicial killings, corollarily, also turned out be a dud. At least, in as far as pinning the killings to the mayor-turned-president.

On the last day of the senate hearing, Senator Gordon mentioned that former Liberal Party Director-General and current CHR Chairman Chito Gascon called him. The topic of the call isnt important for this article, but a particular detail is:

Gascon told Gordon he was in Amsterdam [DZRH], the primary port-of-entry to the Netherlands. Amsterdam and its just an hours drive away from The Hague, the city where ICC sits, the city where Bensouda is based.

Yes, it appears that Gascon has internationalized the Liberal Partys Plan B [TP: PLeni], despite the fact that CHRs inability to prosecute Duterte not because of state negligence or pressure, but due to the fact that no evidence exists.

The Sense of Urgency
Despite being in office for barely four months and despite enjoying overwhelming support from 86% of Filipinos [Balita], he has been facing what could probably be the most vicious minority opposition since the fall of President Marcos in 1986. And not-so-coincidentally, the minority opposition at the time was also the Liberal Party.
Instead of listing down the how and the what, I will, instead, tackle the question of the why. Specifically, why is the opposition so vicious? What are the circumstances that made LP decide to accelerate what would otherwise have been a six-year plan? Is there something that pressured LP to go on overdrive?

Thats we will attempt to answer in this article. That is, lets ask: What is LPs endgame?

2019, the Magic Year
Late 2019 will probably the turning point of contemporary Philippine Politics.

By late 2019, a majority of todays Supreme Court justices will have reached the mandatory retirement age of 70, so that the majority of end-of-2019 justices will be Duterte appointees [TP: SC Math]. A new set of senators will also have replaced the senators elected in 2013. Assuming Duterte retains the same level of local popularity up to then, its pretty certain that anyone he endorses will almost surely win. Add the fact that Duterte enjoys the support of the Lower House, the Police, and the Military.
By late 2019, if things are allowed to progress as they do, Chief Executive Duterte will enjoy support from the Legislature, the Judiciary, the PNP, and the Armed Forces. In short, Duterte will de facto become the most powerful president this country ever had. Meanwhile, the Liberal Party will become trivial, to say the least.

Naturally, the Liberal Party will do everything it can to prevent this from happening.

Mode of Ouster
The Liberal Party fears 2019, and it wants Duterte out of Malacaang before that. There were originally three ways to go about this: impeachment, natural death, and assassination. However, I have already explained in a previous article that Villars DPWH appointment made impeachment impossible [TP: Villar] so were left with natural death and assassination.

Duterte is already 71, and thats already three years past the average Filipinos life expectancy. The problem, however, is that despite the chronic ailments Duterte deals with on an everyday basis, the old man probably wont die anytime soon. While its true that Duterte health may be precarious, blindly relying on natural causes is not the most reliable course of action for LP. After all, the Enrile has been around since the age of the dinosaurs yet he still breathes as of press time.


Thus, we are left with one last option: assassination.


Of course, you may argue that assassination need not be implemented before 2019. However, that argument makes sense only if LP still has a suitable replacement if and when that happens.

What exactly am I trying to say here? Its simple.
There are two preliminary conditions necessary to ensure LPs resurgence:

Duterte's death
Lenis eligibility

The first one is obvious: as long as Daddy D breathes, hes president, so LP needs that to stop. The second one, however, is a little more complicated.

A President Leni
Rules of succession dictate that VP Leni Robredo should replace Duterte should the need arise.

As weve explained, that need arises only if Duterte dies through assassination (or through more creative ways, such as a plane crash). Of course, Duterte is a walking target and LP (or the LP ally US Government) can have him assassinated right away. However, this will not work if done too soon given Dutertes immense local popularity [Indep].

I think its safe to say that Lenis installation after a Duterte assassination will likely trigger another People Power Revolution. The LP doesnt want that, especially since that may translate to a dela Rosa, Inday Sara, Cayetano, or Marcos presidency. LP needs an LP-aligned president, and Leni is the only one with some semblance of moral ascendancy among LPs ranks.

Now, LP can wait for Dutertes popularity to fade. LP can just kill him off in, say, 2019 or 2020. But theres a catch: Bongbong Marcos electoral protest.

Leni vs BBM
I have explained how BBM could have been cheated in the previous elections. First, I explained that the vote counting system hash code anomaly [TP: Hash Code]. Second, I explained how Comelec chose to use obsolete cheating-prone technology from Smartmatic [TP: Obsolete].

I am not totally certain about the parameters of Bongbong Marcos (BBM) electoral protest, but several of high profile lawyers I have spoken to suggest that BBMs case is quite strong. Now, LP would have simply dismissed my claim as hogwash, but their subsequent actions after the case filing suggest otherwise.

Leni wanted in August to have the BBM electoral protest dismissed [Star], arguing that Marcos showed no evidence suggesting her direct or indirect participation in the cheating. This is a very weak argument, as it does not categorically refute the BBMs fraud accusation against the vote counting system per se. Leni again asked the SC in September to dismiss the protest, citing basically the same reasons she gave in August, plus the accusation that BBM forged evidence [SunStar].


Regardless of the veracity of Lenis points, whats clear is that both the August and September motions are dilatory tactics, something that the BBM camp itself pointed out this month [Tribune].
Yes, Leni and LP are delaying the progress of the case.

This is further emphasized by the fact that PNoy appointee and PNoy ex-classmate Caguioa handles the pol case [ABS] so Caguioa can choose to delay the progress of case for as long as he can. PNoy appointee Sereno, in her capacity as Chief Justice, also handles scheduling so she can choose not to include this issue in the weekly en banc sessions.

This isnt a party thats confident in Lenis May 2016 win.

Odds stacked vs LP
Despite its claims of being an impartial body, we all know that politics still plays a major role in the Supreme Court, so that the political alliances of each justice somehow affects his or her decisions on certain issues.

The catch here is this: the affirmation of BBMs case only requires a simply SC-PET majority, i.e. 8 votes out of 15. Its worthy to note that in the event of abstentions, it would be so ironic if SC adopts Sereno bastardized definition of a majority per Grace Poe decision [TP: Poe DQ].

With this in mind, there are several things that makes BBM likelier unseat Leni. These are:

First: SCs Current Roster
Unfortunately for LP, Aquino got to appoint only six justices (Sereno, Reyes, Perlas, Leonen, Jardeleza and Caguioa), so that the other nine are Arroyo appointees. Add the fact that Reyes is Dutertes fraternity brother, along with Arroyo appointee Mendoza [Star].

If justices were to vote along partisan lines, this would be an easy BBM win.

Second: LP-SC Bitter History
We all know that this is generally an anti-PNoy court, and Robredo, being a political neophyte, wouldnt elicit political loyalty from any of the Arroyo-appointed justices. What further exacerbates the situation are:

LPs persecution of Arroyo from 2010 to 2016 as LP filed weak case after weak case to keep her in detention [TP:PGMA Acquit].
LPs barrage against former Chief Justice Renato Corona in retaliation to a then-impending unfavorable Hacienda Luisita decision [TP: Gascon].

Third: Persuadability of swing votes
If PNoy-appointees (five without Reyes) all vote pro-Leni, and there are only two who would vote pro-BBM, BBM still has to persuade six more justices to join his cause. Given the previous point, this shouldnt be very difficult. However, should BBM fail to muster enough support from the swing justices, he can always ask for help from Malacaang.

Duterte is aware of of the entire situation so hes also probably awre of the BBM-Leni issue with respect to his predicament. This may be why he mentioned Imees support for his campaign in a recent speech [GMA]. That is, Duterte subtly sent LP the message that if push comes to shove, hell do what needs to be done.

Fourth: Consecutive retirements
If BBM, even with Dutertes help, fails to muster enough support from the current roster, they can just wait for Duterte to appoint a few more justices to fill the gap. There are 10 justices retiring from today until 2019.

That is, if voting on the BBM protest were to be done today, we will have a President Marcos.

The Plan
Yes, it appears that Leni is most likely unable to hold on to her post for long, so they have to act fast. But before we go further, let me give you a quick recap of the situation from LPs point of view:

First, assassination is required because impeachment is impossible while natural death is unreliable.
Second, regime change has to be before 2019 because BBM will most likely win electoral protest.
Third, Caguioa and Sereno can work hand-in-hand to delay progress of the electoral protest to give LP time to do what needs to be done.

The only thing that probably keeps LP from assassinating Duterte (Read: Plane Crash) is Lenis lack of legitimacy, i.e. shes unlikely to get local support. If Duterte dies today and Leni takes over, we can expect a People Power Revolution in just a few minutes.

To remedy this issue, an international campaign to destroy Dutertes international reputation was put in place. The most recent development  Bensoudas statements  only serve to underline that claim.

Now, if ICCs Bensouda eventually decides to investigate Duterte, then thats pretty much the end of Duterte international legitimacy. An announcement of an ICC investigation will make Duterte look like a madman in the eyes of the world, and were not even talking about an ICC conviction.

Forget the ICC conviction: all LP needs is for Duterte to lose all international credibility, as they could settle with a Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo type president. That is, a President Leni Robredo with no local support, but with international recognition.

With international recognition of her presidency, Robredo crushing a People Power Revolution like Edsa Tres, she will be seen as simply ""enforcing the law"" instead of ""acting like a tyrant"".

From the LPs upper managements point of view, thats a lot better than a toothless post-2019 LP, right?

These series of scenarios actually fit Duterte's pronouncements during his speeches in various military camps in the past couple of months. In those speeches, Duterte told the military to take care of the drug problem should the problem ""outlive"" him, with the preface being his claim that no other presidentiable can solve the drug problem except him.

Let me state this more simply.

If the ICC decides to investigate Duterte, then Duterte will most likely die. Maybe through a bullet, or maybe through a plane crash. A plane crash, perhaps. Because its something that a certain political party tends to be historically good at.

Besides, Duterte himself said [Inq], ""'If my plane crashes, don't worry, Leni is there to replace me"" [TP]

Ressa's Pride before Rappler's Fall,"It all started with Rappler founder Maria Ressas October 3rd rant Propaganda war: Weaponizing the internet, where she accused Duterte supporters of cheating the Facebooks algorithm to boost social media performance statistics. Ressa went on to publish three sequels, while the rest of her Rapplerettes published follow-up articles that follow the same theme.

By far, Ressas biggest accusation is that Duterte pages use bots, something that does not correspond to reality because Facebook has an automated system that periodically detects fake accounts and subsequently deactivates them [FB].

For example, see the image below:
The image above shows daily likes/unlikes for the ThinkingPinoy Facebook Page. From August to October 2016, you can see that likes (blue) and unlikes (red) are generally proportional, except for September 13th, where ThinkingPinoy received a deluge of 1,595 unlikes.

A closer look shows that 21 of those 1,595 unlikes were on my page and posts, so thats probably because I posted something that irritated those users. However, a whopping 1,574, or 98.65% of the unlikes are due to Suspicious Account Removal, which basically means that Facebooks regular purge of fake accounts actually work. That is, 1,595 of my 200,000 likers were fake accounts, and they have since been deleted.

If thats the case, then how can such fake profiles have major impact? Will a bunch of fake profiles with only 100 friends each change the general trajectory of online discourse?

I do not think so.
Rapplers Ressa, through her four-part rant, basically tries to tell us that, Rappler is falling because Duterte supporters cheat.

Thats just too lazy, Miss Ressa. But by singling out Duterte supporters, you tacitly admitted that Rappler is an anti-Duterte organization. Thats not social news, Miss Ressa. Thats the propaganda youve been decrying all along.

But of course, Ressa will probably say this as another lie, another glitch, another thingamajig that only Her Highness can fully comprehend.

So let me ask:
We can argue all day about analytics data and whatnot, but has Ressa and her Rapplerettes even bothered to cover social media basics before they started crying like babies?
Kasi ang problem sa iyo Marya e ang dami-dami mong sinisisi, pero ni minsan e di ka man lang tumingin sa salamin.

Social Media Influence
Throughout her four-part article series, Ressa ranted, and ranted, and ranted. Yes, she tried to provide sources for her claims. Yes, she tried to reason. Yes, she tried.

Yes, in a Ressa-centric world, people would have listened to her and her Rapplerettes. The problem, however, is that the world does not revolve around Rappler and Maria Ressa.

Miss Ressa, you are complaining about the symptoms of Rapplers problem, but you totally fail to acknowledge the underlying disease.
NOTE: Maria Ressa and Rappler are basically one and the same. Rappler could not have gained as much traction as it did when it launched if not for Ressas street cred.
Lithium's chief analytics scientist Michael Wu gave six factors that determine the effectiveness of social media influence [Lithium]:
Timing, or the ability of the influencer to deliver his expert knowledge to the target at the time when the target needed it.
Bandwidth, or the influencer's ability to transmit his expert knowledge through a social media channel.
Alignment, or the amount of channel overlap between the target and the influencer.
Relevance, or how closely the target's information needs coincide with the influencer's expertise.
Credibility, or the influencer's expertise in a specific domain of knowledge.
Confidence, or how much the target trusts the influencer with respect to his information needs.
Even though I am tempted to argue about Rapplers lack of timing, bandwidth, relevance and alignment, Ill just concede that Rappler has that, because Rappler's social media competitors also possess the four anyway. That is, aside from the number of Rappler's followers, Rappler possesses no other competitive advantages in as far as these four factors.

Hence, lets focus on the last two: Credibility and Confidence.

Rapplers Credibility
Relevance refers to Rapplers expertise in what it wants to talk about. Note that Ill just pretend that Ressas Princeton double major in molecular biology and theater are relevant to what shes doing right now.

On paper, Ressa and most of her Rapplerettes will pass. However, I think its pretty clear that her organization has been receiving  and ignoring  negative feedback for quite some time now.

First, Pia Raadas Neuron Count
Look at Raadas article about Dutertes first week in office, an article thats so shallow that it was no match to the insight provided by the fashion magazine Cosmopolitan [TP: 1st week]. To make matters worse, instead of respecting customer feedback, you chose to defend the article by saying its just a blog post [TP: Pias Blog].

Second, Paterno Esmaquels Incompetence (and Agenda)
Esmaquel attempted to sow further intrigue in the EJK issue by conveniently failing to mention that the issue hes raising has already been comprehensively addressed [TP: Wikileaks]. Actually to say that its amateur research work is an understatement.

Third, oh! Dear Lord.
Look at the excruciating stupidity of your reporter who checked Leila de Limas SOCE for campaign donations from drug lords [TP: de Lima SOCE]. He is a newbie, I understand that. But for that article to pass the standards of veteran journalists and get published? Thats a totally different story.

We think you dont know what youre talking about. So wheres the expertise? We do not care about what you think about yourselves. We care about what we think about you.
Public Confidence
Confidence? The public has lost whatever it had for Rappler.

First, Rapplers ethics issues.

During the last couple of weeks of the campaign period, Rappler released a one-sided investigation on Dutertes alleged P. Guevarra Property [TP: 386 Guevarra]. Citing unidentified sources, Rappler went on and on about how the P2-million San Juan Property could be ill-gotten wealth. I punched gaping holes on Rapplers article, something that should not have happened if Rappler only bothered to ask the Duterte camp about it.

I guess Rappler finds due diligence too difficult to do. So why would the public trust you?

Second, Pia Raadas (Personal) Bullsh!t:
When a reader wants to know what Duterte said about Martial Law, the reader wants to know what Duterte said, not what the reporter thinks. This is something that Rapplerette Pia Raada-Robles conveniently forgot when she editorialized Dutertes dare to declare Martial Law [TP: Martial Law] by offering her insipid legal opinion.

When I write articles, I aim to educate. I do not aim to validate my existence. But thats something that Pia is seemingly so obsessed about [TP: Big Ego]. Oh, and did I mention the time when Pia showed patent callousness amids the devastating tragedy that was the Davao Bombing [TP: Why Pia]?

Third, the condescension.
Rappler allowed Prof. Claudios to de facto call Duterte supporters illiterates, among other things[TP: Claudio]. In another incident, Paterno Esmaquel brazenly cyber-bullied and publicly shamed a dissenting commenter [TP: Esmaquel]. But this is not limited to those two: you page moderators themselves exhibit the same behavior.
Rappler, the Sorority Blog

Personally, I think Rappler is just a college sorority blog and little else. Of course, my opinion doesnt matter. But many other facebook users share my opinion, then that becomes the problem, and thats one of the main reasons why Rapplers recent Facebook posts rarely exceed 100 likes.

Because people think Rapplerettes dont know what theyre doing.


And the irony? Rappler even has the balls to teach the secret behind a successful social media campaign. Jesus H Christ. If Rappler knew the secret, Ressa wouldnt be whining right now. Thats just like Sen. Trillanes trying to teach law.


Seventy-five million Duterte supporters have basically started to see Rappler as an external threat to their political interests. And because of social media, those Filipinos have found a way to air their grievances.

But instead of listening, Rappler simply fueled the flames. Remember the term Dutertard? Rappler published full-length Celdran-centric article about it [Rap].

Did any of Rapplers over-opinionated Rapplerettes call out the slur? No. You even used that term when you tried to school Duterte supporters in what appears to be another condescending article [Rap].

Duterte supporters distrust Rappler. Unfortunately for Ressa and her Rapplerettes, 76% of Filipinos approve of Dutertes performance [VoA], and about the same proportion have much trust in him [BW].

Facebook user Gideon Lasco once said:
Your first mistake was to call us stupid. Your second was to underestimate how many of us there are...
Unfortunately for Rappler, external conflict increases internal cohesion [Stein 1976], and ""Dutertards"" are starting to kick Rappler's ass. There's at least 75 million of us, so what will you, Rappler, do now?

Let me state this very simply, in case Pia Raada's brain can't handle it:
Rappler is dying because it's full of assholes spewing bullshit nonstop. And on social media, assholes get ignored, just like in real life, just like what's happening to Rappler right now.
NOW SUFFER.

P.S. I didn't proofread this article anymore. It's not worth the time.

"Duterte's 1st 100 days, ""Team PH Losing', and why Ramos nixed China Trip","In an earlier Facebook post, I used the Love Triangle analogy to explain the Philippines' foreign policy realignment. The original post, written in Filipino, goes something like this:

I think you'd agree with me that your boyfriend was better during the courtship phase.
Now imagine you're the Philippines.
The United States is like the your boyfriend. Over the past 70 years, the boyfriend started to take you for granted. You eventually got so fed up that you unilaterally demanded for a cool off. 
The US could've just left you right then and there, but he he can't. You live right across the street to China, America's archnemesis. While the you were still dating the US, he gets to drop by your house to check on what China's doing. With the cool off, however, he can't do that anymore. 
And worse, China wants to be your rebound boyfriend! As soon as he caught wind of the cool-off, he started being nice to you. He stopped harassing your fishermen-neighbours, he built rehab facilities, he even promised a massive railway system! He even offers to fix your slow internet! Who are you to refuse free gifts anyway? 
That doesn't mean you and China are like, together-together. You're not that cheap. Despite China's advances, you still like the US, so you're still waiting for his next move. Unfortunately, what he managed to do so far is remind you of every miniscule thing he did for you. As if that works, right? 
But still, you wait. But your patience is wearing thin, and you have to take action. Will you wait forever for the US to redeem himself, or is it time to move on? 
Now THAT is the question.
From Words to Action
It's one thing to have a plan, but it's another thing to implement it, and what got the ball rolling was the South China Sea dispute.

On 12 July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration released its decision on the Philippines-China South China Sea Case, triggering an unwelcome increase in tensions between both sides [TP: Yasay's Face]. A couple of days later, to cool things down a bit, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced that former President Fidel V. Ramos would ""go to China to start the talks"", albeit without a time frame [TSHK].

Duterte said back then, ""I have to consult many people, including president Ramos. I would like to respectfully ask him to go to China and start the talks.""
Ramos announced in mid-August that Beijing welcomed him to visit Beijing for diplomatic discussions. Ramos, however, told reporters that the ruling was not directly discussed and that another negotiator might take his place [AP].

In a confusing turn of events, Ramos' camp announced mid-September that he has cancelled his Beijing trip, although the source Ramos would still go to Beijing when the time was right [Straits] which, in diplomatic terms, means, I do not really know but most probably, never.

War and Peace
This writer believes that war is not clearly not an option, as explained in a previous ThinkingPinoy article Duterte's Philippines breaking away from the United States?, so that peace is the only option. Duterte also explained this several times during his speeches.

Duterte's choice of Ramos, I believe, was based on a mix of political gravitas and the lack of any other choices. At the time of the announcement, Duterte cannot possibly go on a state visit to China because he was still gauging how the Americans would react to the arbitral decision.
Duterte couldn't have sent Vice-president Leni Robredo because she's too closely linked to former President Aquino, whose administration brought us to the brink of war, thanks to his cronies' interests in South China Sea hydrocarbons [TP: Karen Davila].

With Leni out of the picture, he had to send the next-next-best thing in terms of political clout: a former Philippine President. Cory Aquino has passed away, Joseph Estrada is a convicted plunderer [GMA], Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is bad PR through-and-through [TP: Arroyo], while Pnoy is a moron [TP: SCS 101]. Thus, he's left with no one else but Fidel Ramos.

Yes, Ramos was entangled in the PEA-Amari Scam, or what the PCIJ called the grandmother of all scams, but it was never proven and largely forgotten by the public, so that won't drastically affect Ramos' legitimacy in the eyes of the Filipino public.

But he cancelled right when he's about to fly to Beijing, right? What happened?

Ramos assesses Duterte' 1st 100 days
In DU30s first 100 days  Team Philippines losing, Ramos wrote (in all caps),WE FIND OUR TEAM PHILIPPINES LOSING IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF DU30S ADMINISTRATION  AND LOSING BADLY.

My first reaction was, Okay, fair enough. So tell me why you said so.
NOTE: We'll assume that this Manila Bulletin op-ed article, whether written by Ramos or not, actually has Ramos' imprimatur. Why? Because it's been two days and he hasn't disowned it.
Ramos (or his writer, because the article uses third-person pronouns a tad too often), cited two specific issues: the Hitler Statement and the anti-American tirades. Yes, the extrajudicial killings issue is also worrisome in some respects but it does not directly affect foreign policy, and Philippine foreign policy is my focus in this piece.
I think the Hitler issue, in as far as the Jews are concerned, while deplorable [TP: Dissecting Duterte] has been largely taken care of after his profuse apology to the Philippine Jewish Community [Video]. I have reason to believe that and should not be much of an issue in the long-term.

What's more telling, however, is Ramos' statement regarding the uncertainty of PH-US relations, wher he wrote, SO, WHAT GIVES?? ARE WE THROWING AWAY DECADES OF MILITARY PARTNERSHIP, TACTICAL PROFICIENCY, COMPATIBLE WEAPONRY, PREDICTABLE LOGISTICS, AND SOLDIER-TO-SOLDIER CAMARADERIE JUST LIKE THAT?? ON P. DU30S SAY-SO???


I have been looking for an answer for Ramos' September cancellation announcement, and I think I got it in this piece of his.

Ramos' Stance: Prudence vs Outright Aversion?
That last statement regarding PH-US relations, in itself, can be easily interpreted as prudence that stems from Ramos' presidential wisdom. However, after examining the rest of the article, I discovered several easter eggs that clearly suggest where Ramos wants the country to stand.

In the section Filipino Hospitality and Humanitarianism, Ramos detailed our history of accepting refugees from all around the world. That's great to hear, really, but he mentioned two things that will surely ruffle more than a few northern feathers:

The White Russians when they fled from Shanghai in 1949 as the Communist Red Army was about to lay siege.
In 1949, when some 30,000 Chinese mainlanders belonging to the Kuomintang also sought sanctuary in the Philippines to avoid capture by Communist Chinese forces

Let's put this back into perspective.

First, Ramos was supposed to be the envoy to China, and China is currently governed by the Communist Party, the same organization that was portrayed as oppressors in those two bullet points. Ramos is a very intelligent guy: he will not mention those two things without intending these conclusions.

Second, Ramos' portrayal of the Kuomintang as being oppressed by Communist China is bad enough, but what makes this worse is the fact that the Kuomintang is actually the core of Taiwan's political history [Britannica]. And as we all know, Taiwan is China's breakaway sister. In short, Ramos basically implied that China bullies Taiwan. That's bad for a would-be diplomat.

We can argue all day about what's the truth and what's not, but we're talking about Ramos, the potential diplomat. Surely, a would-be diplomat, who's supposed to be smarter than Duterte, will not publish these anti-Chinese phrases unless he really intends to offend the Chinese.


In short, I think Ramos cancelled his Beijing Trip because his viewpoints do not align with the Duterte Administrations' stance.

So no, he cannot be the envoy.

Ramos' Skepticism
At face value, I think Ramos' skepticism against Mainland China is understandable given his experience with China when he was still the president.

Claiming storm damage in 1995, seven Chinese Navy vessels entered the area to repair ""fishing shelters"" in Panganiban Reef (Mischief Reef). The Ramos Government tried internationalize this issue through several means, including the call for invocation of the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty [Dzurek 1995].

And being the inferior US ally that we have always been, the Ramos-era legislators' calls for the invocation of the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty fell onto deaf American ears, as American Ambassador Negroponte called on both parties to settle the dispute peacefully.

Yes, America basically told Ramos that they do not want to fight for us, a sentiment that they reiterated 21 years later in 2016, when the US State Department said the same thing to us just hours after arbitral ruling [FocusTaiwan]

Yes, dj vu. But the dj vu doesn't end there.

Another dj vu
At first glance, it appears that the Philippines was bullied in 1995, only to be neglected by the United States soon after. But that isn't the entire story, because the Chinese Navy isn't stupid enough to send seven ships just to fix fishing shelters.

A year prior to the 1995 incident, the Philippines' announced that the American company, Alcorn Petroleum, would be exploring the Kalayaan Area [Dzurek 1995], directly violating the 1992 ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea, of which both China and the Philippines are signatories [NUS].

Thus, on the question of Who did it first?, it's sad to say that the answer is us, the Philippines. That's something that Filipino mainstream media failed to mention in recent memory, either because of incompetence, or because they're in the payroll of rich men with vested interests.

But like I've said, there's another dj vu.

China re-occupied the Spratlys some time after 2012, right? And we all complained that China is a bully, right? What no mainstream media man tried to point out is that in 2011, Aquino's Foreign Secretary allowed Manny Pangilinan's Philex Petroleum to explore Reed Bank, which is, again, in contravention of the 1992 Declaration of Conduct [TP: Reed Bank].

We basically did in 2011 the same thing we did in 1994.

Let's cut the long story short
Ramos basically does not believe in Duterte's Foreign Policy. That's why he wrote that piece.

Ramos statement regarding US-Philippines military relations gives us a pretty good glimpse of where he stands on the US-PH-China love triangle. That is, while he wants us to make peace with China, he is unwilling to distance ourselves from the United States.

Ramos' stance on China, as laid out by history and his recent Manila Bullettin article, is actually the reason why he's ineligible the country's post-arbitration chief negotiator, chiefly because uncompromising diplomat is an oxymoron. Moreover, wouldn't it be the irony of ironies if we let him talk to the Chinese when he basically committed the same mistake that Aquino-MVP-Del Rosario-Trillanes committed [TP: SCS Trillanes]?

But most importantly, after having been jilted twice vis-a-vis the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, why haven't we learned yet?

By the way, Ambassador Negroponte has strong links with Loida Nicolas-Lewis [TV5] and by extension, Vice-President Leni Robredo [Inq].

But let's save that story for another day.

"Inquirer, Rappler dying? The Rise of the Millennial Mosquito Press","He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. - Friedrich Nietszche.
I, ThinkingPinoy, support political dissent directed towards the administration. Despite my support for the Duterte, I still promoted dissenters like ABS-CBN Inday Espina-Varona [TP], and praised CNN Philippines in the Kantalk Podcast [TP: KanTalk E11]. Despite my support, I have even criticized the Duterte administration several times [TP: Rape Joke; TP: Malacanang; TP: Hitler], and this:

However, I can't help but notice the disproportionate representation of political beliefs in mainstream media, where the minority political opinion overwhelmingly drowns the political opinion of most.

Ninety-one percent of Filipinos trust Duterte [GMA]. Meanwhile, seventy-four percent approve of his performance [CBS]. Despite this, I find it disturbing that the vast majority of news bits Filipinos have been reading daily since the old man took his oath have been overwhelmingly critical of the president. That is, it appears to me that a vast majority of media men belong to the 0.2 percent of the population who distrust Duterte [Star], or the 11 percent who are dissatisfied in his performance [BW].
Mainstream discourse on Philippine Politics today is dominated, if not monopolized, by the minority, with the Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI) leading the pack.

PDI started it with the Kill List, which blamed upon the administration virtually all vigilante killings. Using the list, PDI claimed a dramatic and unmistakable rise in extrajudicial killings since Duterte took office. Despite its extremely problematic, irresponsible, and unscientific methodology [TP: Kill List], PDI continued peddling this list to international news outlets, alienating Western Media from the Philippine Government.

To top it all off, no less than Inquirer Editor-in-Chief John Nery, whos supposed to be impartial on the issue, actively influences international publications to be negative of Duterte, despite of his lack of evidence, despite his lack of first-hand knowledge on the EJK issue [LATimes].

I repeat: three in four Filipinos approve of Duterte, but a vast majority of news bits today do not.

The Emergence of Social Media
I examined Strategic and Consumer Media Insights (SCMI)s 2016 Philippine Media Overview [PANA].

SCMI reported that in its 2014 survey, free-to-air TV dominated daily media reach at 91 percent of the general population. Mobile phones were 2nd at 79 percent, and internet 3rd with 38 percent. Only 8 percent regularly access newspapers. The story is different for millennials, or those who came of age after the turn of the millennium, where mobile phone was at 95 percent, TV at 86, and Internet at 54.life.
Basically, mobile phones and the internet are over traditional media (TV, Radio, Newspaper) as the primary platform for information dissemination. It is not unreasonable to conclude that in the near future, social media will become the primary political battleground.

Truth be told, this may have already happened, as evidenced by Dutertes May 2016 win. Duterte won because of Free Facebook that allowed him to reach 46 percent of the electorate [CampaignAsia].

Yes, evidence suggests that social media is it, and mainstream media is feeling the heat as it faces serious challenges from a new mosquito press: the Millennial Mosquito Press.

Inquirer and the Mosquito Press
In i-Witness: Ang Kagat ng Mosquito Press (The Sting of the Mosquito Press), journalist Howie Severino [GMA] said in Filipino, I still remember a time when news can be obtained from just a few sources. And now, we all know that many were lies, and a lot was hidden from the people.

The Mosquito Press refers to small and independent publications that continued to criticize the Martial Law government despite the dangers that it entailed. These publications were likened to mosquitos, small creatures that carry a stinging bite.

The Marcos-era mosquito press served as alternative sources of information at a time when state-controlled mainstream media provided limited information. It was the mosquito press that exposed then-budding intellectuals like UP Mass Communication Professor Danny Arao to both the truths and the lies about martial law and the so-called New Society [Arao 2006].
Mr. and Mrs. Special Edition tabloid editor Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc (LJM) was one of the icons of the Marcos-era mosquito press. Before Mr. and Mrs., LJM worked for the Manila Bulettins Panorama Magazine, where she was fired for writing articles that poked fun on Pres. Marcos [Inq]. Mr. and Mrs. is the predecessor of todays Philippine Daily Inquirer [Inq].

Yes, the mosquito press of old has become the mainstream of the past three decades. But with the emergence of social media, this new mainstream is challenged by a new, social media-based, mosquito press: the Millennial Mosquito Press.

The Regular Citizen's Voice
I could have easily dismissed these suspicions if not for the fact that mainstream media has started reacting to reactions from the public, something that it rarely did before social media became en vogue.

Ten years ago, public reactions were usually confined to Letters to the Editor sections of newspapers, a section that even I, during my newspaper-reading days, did not give a damn about. Today, however, mainstream outlets have started complaining about netizen behavior, suggesting that the former is starting to feel the heat.


Many mainstream media people, led by the National Union of Journalists (NUJP) in the Philippines, recently decried the supposed silencing of political dissent as they accuse Duterte supporters of threatening some mainstream journalists for criticizing the President [Inq]. Ironically, NUJPs president is a veteran reporter of the Philippine Daily Inquirer [Inq].

I categorically condemn threats of violence, and I respect NUJPs right to pursue legal action against abusive netizens. However, this NUJP reaction suggests a shifting of the tides, a redistribution of power over the shaping of political discourse.

But Inquirer-NUJP isnt the only one.

Ressa's Rants
Last month, several camps, including a university professor SC, who actively contributes for Rappler, accused ThinkingPinoy of receiving millions of pesos in exchange for supporting the Duterte Administration. SC, in particular, could not believe that ThinkingPinoy is a one-man operation, even going as far as saying that it should be operated by a team of people.

A few days before that incident, I published Mainstream vs Indie: Whos winning the Social Media Wars?, where I discovered that in terms of Facebook user engagement, ThinkingPinoy is starting to rival Rapplers Facebook performance. Moreover, on an engagement-per-post basis, ThinkingPinoy exceeds Rappler by over 10%.


Fast forward to a few days ago, veteran journalist and Rappler founder Maria Ressa, using the all-too-convenient undisclosed sources strategy, went ahead and accused several Duterte-aligned social media entities as part of a large-scale, well-funded online propaganda machine. Ressa also accused these Duterte-aligned pages of gaming Facebooks algorithm, suggesting that Rappler shouldve been on top of the rankings instead.

Interestingly, Ressa was on a meeting with Rappler investor Omidyar Network on the same day the article was published. As a side note, I think its quite ironic that Ressa makes major funding for Duterte supporters appear like its necessarily evil, when the fact of the matter is that Rappler, a social media entity in itself, receives major funding. But I am digressing.

Given this, it appears that Ressas undisclosed source may actually the same person who made that accusation last month.

Regardless, these recent developments suggest that traditional media companies such as the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Rappler, characterized by large-scale funding and large workforces, have started to feel threatened, and for good reason.
The Rise of the Millennial Mosquito Press
Facebook is the undisputed leader in social media platforms in the country: with Free Data promos, I think's that's pretty obvious. Add the fact that Filipinos being second only to Brazilians in terms of time spent online [WeAreSocial].

Facebook, plus the lack of diversity in political opinion in mainstream media, is what helped fuel the rise of the new Mosquito Press. The Millenial Mosquito Press.

Now, I can try to analyze how mainstream media companies perform with respect to other social media players, but that will take too long and I doubt that I can say everything in just 2000 words. Instead, I will focus on two major mainstream players: Inquirer and Rappler.


If there's something that Inquirer and Rappler shares, it's their disdain for Duterte and their reverence for everything Liberal Party. Thus, I felt its best to compare their social media presence to those of Duterte-aligned pages. In particular, I will use my own page, ThinkingPinoy.

Note, however, that are other Duterte-aligned Facebook pages that are far more influential than ThinkingPinoy, such as TNP  Trending News Portal and Mocha Uson Blog.

Mocha Uson's social media influence is particularly undeniable. When I checked Facebook Page insights on 25 August 2016, data showed that she has engagement that's greater than Inquirer and Rappler combined, and just a little below GMA Network's figures [TP: Indie vs Mainstream]:

But I am digressing.
Inquirer-Rappler vs ThinkingPinoy
I discovered Facebook Page Insights in late August, and I was shocked to discover the the performance stats of Rappler, Inquirer, Thinking Pinoy, and other related pages.

This is what what I got on 29 August 2016:


Now. this is what I got a month later on 24 September 2016:


Here are the stats for 26 September 2016:


And this is for 03 October 2016:



And this is for 04 October 2016:

The data from the past couple of months suggest that ThinkingPinoy may actually challenging both Rappler and the Inquirer in terms of influence on public opinion.

What's more alarming is the fact that ThinkingPinoy is NOT the most influential member of the Millennial Mosquito Press. Mocha Uson and TNP- Trending News Portal enjoy far higher engagement figures than TP.


At face value, Rappler's and Inquirer's main problem is ego, but in reality, they may be facing something more alarming that just losing bragging rights.

They may not be making enough money.

Rappler and Inquirer's Revenue Figures
Mainstream media companies require profits to survive, and they derive this mainly from advertising in their respective websites. Thus, driving web traffic into their sites is key.

Let's estimate monthly revenues based on August 2016 traffic statistics, starting with a few figures:
Rappler.com received 14.3 million visitors [SimilarWeb]
Inquirer.net received 21.4 million visitors [SimilarWeb]
ThinkingPinoy.net, my blog, received 490,000 visitors [SimilarWeb]
The best-paying advertisement network today is Google Adsense, and all three sites have Adsense ads embedded in their pages. For August 2016, ThinkingPinoy (my site) received approximate Php 18,000 pesos. Now, Rappler has about 30 times, while Inquirer has about 44 times, my site traffic. That is for August 2016, Rappler should have received around Php 540,000, while Inquirer received Php 792,000.

Of course, there are many other variables that affect ad revenue, so let's just give Rappler and Inquirer the benefit of the doubt by assuming that, for August 2016, they earned Php 1 million and Php 1.5 million, respectively.

Facebook is a powerful tool to gain influence and thus, drive traffic to one's website. However, it does not make money in the strictest sense of the word. Facebook has monetization platforms, but its more of a joke than anything else. For one, it announced plans of allowing publishers to monetize videos [Forbes], but it has yet to implement this feature.

In short, Facebook content does not make real money.

Revenue vs Expenses
Now, my 18,000 plus donations amounting to about P5,000 a month is just about enough to pay for my internet bill (Php 4,000), electricity (Php 5,000), and my living expenses (food, clothing, rent). I focused full-time on TP so I don't have a day job right now. And when I fall short, I borrow money from real-life friends. That hasn't happened yet, though. I know how to live within my means.
SIDE NOTE: Well, Im sorry to burst Ressas bubble but behind TP is me, a one-man team.  Behind Sass Sasot is her, a one-woman team. Behind Mocha is Mocha, a one-woman team. Contrary to what you'd like believe, Rappler is not the most social media savvy entity on the planet. Yeah, masakit sa dibdib para iyo na tanggapin 'yan, lalo na kung totoong palugi ka na.
Basically, even if it's difficult, ThinkingPinoy is managing to survive. The same goes for other non-profit ""millennial mosquito press"" outfits like Sass Rogando Sasot (who does everything for free), MindaNation (which is run by a very lean team of less than 10 people).

But Rappler and Inquirer are not as lucky. For example, Rappler should be employing at least 50 people, judging from the photo of the "" Rappler Team"" shown below:

The Rappler Team, image courtesy of Rappler
Now, 1 million pesos divided by 50 heads amount to only 20,000 pesos per person. That's not a living wage for journalists in Manila. Add maintenance and other operating expenses, I find it hard to imagine how Rappler can survive with monthly revenues of just Php 1million. We can even assume a monthly revenue of Php 2 million, and it still won't be enough.

The same goes for the Inquirer, although it can be argued that they sell print newspapers, which also help boost revenue, though arguably by a relatively minimal amount. But then, the Inquirer is a much larger organization, most probably employing over twice the number of Rappler's employees.

Simply put, it's very likely that their operating costs grossly exceed their revenues. In business, that's called ""heading towards bankruptcy.""

Contrast that to small and independent Millennial Mosquito Press players who are essentially non-profit and thus are willing to work on pennies and peanuts, who do what they do for love of country.

So I cannot help but ask:

If this is true, where do Rappler and Inquirer get the extra money to balance their books? 
ThinkingPinoy's Takeaways
In terms of social media influence, the poorly-funded Millenial Mosquito Press is rivalling heavily-funded mainstream media players like the Inquirer and Rappler. That fact in itself is shocking, but what's more shocking is the fact that non-TV mainstream media players are starting to feel the financial impact, as they appear to be losing the profitability that they too easily enjoyed in the past.

Times are changing, my friend: the Millennial Mosquito Press is rising, and Maria Ressa can't accept that fact. [ThinkingPinoy.net]

A Furious Germany? Dissecting Duterte's Hitler Statement,"Dear President Duterte, you need to apologize for the Hitler analogy, but...
*****
So there I was, peacefully doing my laundry, when a friend told me that The Guardian UK reported that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to kill 3 million drug addicts and likened himself to Hitler [Guardian]. Theres even a 40-second video clip embedded in the Guardian article to support the claim.

My initial reaction was, Okay, what did he do this time? After all, hes not a stranger to controversial statements, like when he cursed Pope Francis in November [TP: Tatang] or when he unleashed a rape-related joke in April [TP: Jalosjos].

The Guardians Bangkok-based Southeast Asian correspondent Oliver Holmes quoted Dutertes statement, If Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have [Duterte points to himself] Hitler massacred three million Jews ... theres three million drug addicts. There are. Id be happy to slaughter them.
Taken at face value, this statement is absolutely controversial, if not absolutely offensive. As expected, Duterte critics were quick to capitalize on this newest pronouncement. Duterte supporters, on the other hand, were quick to defend the old man.

That Duterte said those words is not a matter of debate. The issue, however, is what those words really meant.

Dutertes (more comprehensive) statement
Upon his September 30th arrival from his Vietnam state visit, Duterte delivered a speech and answered questions from local media. Part of the event is shown below:

Duterte, in a mix of English, Tagalog, and Cebuano, said:
[EU lawyers said] that this official... even when he was (still) a mayor, he was threatening to kill the criminals. What (a) group of idiots in the purest form! You know, if you want to charge me, you have to find out if the penal laws of this land would make a mayor liable if he threatens criminals, or intimidate the wrongdoers.

To imagine that I would be facing even the International Court [of Justice] for genocide. Such tomfoolery!

Imagine you're in my situation. You're a president and they do the same to you. I'm okay with it, I am used to politics. I've experienced all the filth in my life.
US, EU, you can call me anything, but I was never into, or I am never into hypocrisy, (un)like you. (You) closed your doors, it's winter time, there are migrants escaping from the Middle East. You allow them to rot, and then you worry about the death of, about, 1000, 2000, 3000 (criminals)?

Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. Now, there (are) 3 million drug addicts (in the Philippines). I'd be happy to slaughter them. At least, if Germany had Hitler, the Philippines would have, you know

My victims... I would like to be... all criminals to finish this problem of my country and save the next generation from perdition. Thank you.
Duterte has a nasty habit of not finishing his sentences [TP: Media Guide], hence the prodigious use of parenthesized words in the quoted text.

Dutertes statement 2 days prior
After watching his speech for the first time a few hours ago, my initial impression was that he stated the words with sarcasm, in light of his 28 September 2016 statement, or two days prior to the Hitler incident, directed at EU, among others:
""I have a serious problem in my country. If I fail, I know that it will destroy my country Whos involved in the (illegal drug trade)? 11 generals, (35% of all) barangay (village) captains, mayors, (about 14,000) policemen So what am I supposed to do?

Obama EU, and EU lawyers who passed a resolution calling my attentioneven threatening me to face the International Court of Justice (for allegedly committing) Genocide.

Genocide is when you kill the Jews, or one tribe, one sect, (or those) belonging to the same religion. How can they charge me for genocide if I kill these (drug addicts) who do nothing but destroy my motherland?

What did the EU do?
Judging from this lengthy quote, I think its clear that Duterte is displeased with the EUs 13 September 2016 statement [Europa], part of which states:
Whereas, during his election campaign and first days in office, President Duterte repeatedly urged law enforcement agencies and the public to kill suspected drug traffickers who did not surrender, as well as drug users.

[The European Parliament] urges the authorities to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international human rights standards and international instruments ratified by the Philippines.
At first glance, the European Parliament resolution appears to simply be stating the obvious. A closer look, however, shows that it is more than that. Much more than that.


The EU Resolutions Implications
The EU dangerously oversimplified Dutertes statement. Yes, he did urge law enforcement and the public to kill suspected drug traffickers and drug addicts, but only on the condition that the arresting party lifes is put in grave danger when a suspect violently resists arrest.

Duterte specifically said [TP: 400 Deaths]:

Feel free to call the police, or do it yourself if you have a gun In an arrest, you must overcome the resistance of the criminal. And if he fights (if) he fights to (the) death, you can kill him. Just follow that. Only if your life is in danger and the criminal is armed and hostile, shoot him, and I will give you a medal.

Duterte is not most eloquent world leader, but I think that his instructions, while gruesomely worded, is actually the standard operating procedure for law enforcement throughout the world. If it werent, then all policemen on the planet should not be carrying guns in the first place.

Whats more disturbing about the EU resolution, however, is the part that urges the authorities to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with international instruments ratified by the Philippines.""

International instruments ratified by the Philippines? In the context of the EUs statement, this phrase likely refers to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or the International Criminal Court (ICC), both of which include the Philippines as a signatory.


And in the context of the extrajudicial killings issue, what other crime would Duterte or his government be most likely to be charged with but genocide?

Essentially, the EU Parliament threatens Duterte or the Philippine government with a potential ICC or ICJ genocide case.

Putting things into perspective

Aside from the deliberate misrepresentation of, or the EUs uncanny ignorance regarding, Dutertes words regarding killing criminals, a more disturbing reality is that the EU appears to blame the government for the extrajudicial killings issue, despite the lack of convincing evidence linking the Duterte Administration with such [TP: How to Destroy Duterte].

Duterte said the EU did all of these without consulting their Philippine envoys, without investigating the issue themselves.

And to top it all off, they even had the gall to threaten the Duterte Administration with international court proceedings akin to The Nuremberg Trials against Nazi officials.

So lets go back to the Hitler statement. The grossly misinformed EU resolution visibly irritated Duterte, as Duterte clearly stated repeatedly, beforehand, that his war on drugs is in no way similar to Hitler-type genocide. Why would Duterte be irritated? Because the EU tacitly called him a mass murderer, if not a genocidal maniac.


To get back at the EU parliament, Duterte sarcastically used the Hitler analogy, something that inevitably struck a raw nerve in Germany, the de facto leader of the EU that carries with it the eternal shame of its Nazi past. True enough, Germany said his Hitler analogy was unacceptable [ABS]. However, as far as my common sense allows me to see, this serves the EU Parliament just right.

Should Duterte apologize to the EU? I dont know, but I wouldnt really mind if he doesnt.

Spare the Jews
But theres a catch: Mr. President, please spare the Jews from the word war.

Jews got entangled in Dutertes rhetoric as any Hitler analogy inevitably includes the Jews, the people that Hitlers Nazis slaughtered by the millions during the Holocaust from 1933 to 1945.

This is where you, Mr. President, got it wrong.

My best friend is a Jew, and weve had many conversations about historical anti-Semitism, conversations that usually culminate into a discussion of the Holocaust.

Mr. President, you were carried away by his emotions again, so carried away that the Jews got involved in your craving to get back at the self-proclaimed moralist that is the EU parliament. 

Here is where an apology is in order. Yes, there are bad Jews and there also are good Jews, in the same way that there are bad Filipinos and there are also good Filipinos. However, just because some are bad doesnt mean all of them are bad.

My best friend is a good Jew. 

Dear Mr. President, I can understand if you wont apologize to Germany and the rest of the European Union. Actually, I think they deserve the sh*t you threw at them.

But please, apologize to the good Jews. They did not deserve to hear what you said.

Note, however, that I still support you, because I believe that while this issue is disconcerting, there are bigger fish (or pigs) to fry.",RJ Nieto,"October 1, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/10/a-furious-germany-dissecting-dutertes.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Wikileaks, Duterte, Sipaco and DDS: Rapplers Paterno Esmaquel strikes again","This new post completes the article Duterte 'admitted complicity' in Davao killings  WikiLeaks, written by Rappler reporter and part-time cyberbully Paterno Esmaquel II.

""Complete"" the article? Yes, because Esmaquel all-too-conveniently forgot to include several important details, details that will make his article fall apart.

Esmaquel reported about a 08 May 2009 US Embassy diplomatic cable, which suggests Dutertes complicity to the legendary vigilante group Davao Death Squad (DDS).

The embassy cable, written by then-US Ambassador to Manila Kristie Kenney, states:
""Commission on Human Rights regional director Alberto Sipaco (strictly protect) at a private meeting affirmed that Mayor Duterte knows about the killings and permits them. Recounting a conversation he once had with Duterte, who is his close friend and former fraternity brother, Sipaco said he pleaded with the Mayor to stop vigilante killings and support other methods to reduce crime, like rehabilitation programs for offenders.""
ThinkingPinoy looked for the diplomatic cable that Esmaquel quoted. It was entitled DAVAO OFFICIALS DENY VIGILANTE KILLINGS, BUT HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BLAMES MAYOR. The quoted paragraph above was taken from the fifth point in the cable.

The Top Comments
At first glance, the articles premise already sounds problematic because it basically states Esmaquel allegedly heard it from Wikileaks who allegedly heard it from Kenney who allegedly heard it from Sipaco who allegedly heard it from Duterte.
Basically, Esmaquel gave us double hearsay evidence at best, quadruple hearsay at worst. In as far as the validity of evidence, this situation is no different from the Sampalan sa BPI Julia Vargas incident, where disgraced Senator Antonio Trillanes allegedly heard something from a Joseph de Mesa who heard something from an alleged AMLC insider.

These claims will not be admissible in court.

One of the Rappler article commenters already pointed this out. In reply to that comment, another person suggested that a proper investigating body should verify this information from Wikileaks.

Fair enough, so ThinkingPinoy asks, Has this lead been investigated, or is this a totally new lead?

Paternos all-too-convenient omission
The same leaked US diplomatic cable [Wikileaks] also stated:
Sipaco acknowledged that the CHR was taking its mission in Davao very seriously. On the margins of the public hearings, the CHR was working to locate witnesses, retrieve them in private unmarked cars, collect their testimony in undisclosed and protected locations, and seek their agreement to testify.
Moreover, on the section indicating the Ambassadors comments, Kenney wrote:
With the police failing to make any progress on investigations, the CHR and civil society groups have become the primary advocates on the issue.
Given these additional quotes, the reader will surely ask, So what?

The diplomatic cable shows it was prepared in May 2009, and it said it was being written during CHRs ongoing investigation on DDS. Sipaco, the witness, is actually CHR Region XI Director.

Now, who was CHR Chairperson during those times?

Senator Leila de Lima [GMA].

De Limas Investigation
Sipacos allegations in the leaked diplomatic cables is actually part of set of claims that led to CHRs 2009 investigation into Dutertes alleged involved with the Davao Death Squad. Yes, Sipacos claims were already investigated by no less than Senator Leila de Lima herself, while the latter was still headed by the Commission on Human Rights.
De Lima actually spearheaded this investigation, so actively that she even broke our countrys laws in a desperate bid to prove her point.

On 16 July 2009, two months after the publication of the diplomatic cable, Panabo City inmate Jonathan Balo sued De Lima, House Speaker Prospero Nograles and six other people for allegedly taking him out of his detention cell without a court order [Star].

Balo didnt want to leave his cell in fear of being summarily executed.

Nevertheless, Balo was illegally taken out of his cell and told hell be taken to a police station to identify a suspect. Upon reaching the police station, he was transferred to another vehicle and brought to the Laud quarry site in Ma-a, Davao City. There, he was forced to admit being a DDS member.

Balo was brought to the Laud quarry site at a time when a CHR-led team was searching the area for the supposed remains of victims of the DDS, a vigilante group.

The Investigations Aftermath
The 2009 CHR investigation headed by de Lima and of which Sipaco was part ended some time in 2012, as page 16 of CHRs 2012 Annual Report states [CHR]:
The Commission recommended that the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) investigate the possible administrative and criminal liability of Mayor Duterte for the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) [to investigate] for [the] Department of Justice (DOJ) to duly prosecute the persons responsible
This recommendation basically instructs three government agencies  Ombudsman, NBI, and DOJ  to take action.


Interestingly, by the time the CHR issued its recommendations, De Lima was already Justice Secretary, after having been appointed as such as soon as President Aquino took his 2010 oath of office [GMA].

Thus, de Lima actually had control over both the Department of Justice and all its agencies, including the National Bureau of Investigation. That is, de Limas DOJ appointment after her CHR chairmanship placed her in the best position to see the DDS issue resolved once and for all.


After six years at the DOJs helm, De Lima admitted on 20 August 2016 that the CHR failed to file cases against Duterte or his aides for lack of evidence when she said, We dont have enough evidence against them [MT].

NBI and DOJs effort reached a dead end so theres only one agency left to talk about: the Ombudsman.

Sipaco and the Ombudsman
The Ombudsman ordered the investigation of the DDS issue closed and terminated for lack of evidence, the same reason cited by De Lima herself.

On 15 January 2016, the Ombudsmans Field Investigation Office issued a final disposition addressed to CHR Chair Gascon, part of which reads [OMB]:
no evidence was gathered to support killings attributed or attributable to DDS It is respectfully recommended that the investigation of this case be CLOSED AND TERMINATED. 
Yes, the Ombudsman cited insufficient evidence too.


Whats more interesting, however, is that Sipaco was quoted in the document.

Sipaco said, It would be unbecoming of the Commission if through chismis and other gossips, we would be relying on it as fact already when there are no supporting justification.

Yes, Sipaco said that himself. Yes, the same Sipaco who allegedly told Ambassador Kenney that Duterte admitted involvement in DDS. Yes, the same Sipaco cited in Wikileaks.

Sipaco said DDS was chismis (gossip), the same Sipaco who released the statement that was the central premise of Paterno Esmaquels piece.


Esmaquels Self-contradictory Article

With that, Esmaquels Rappler article falls apart, just like most of what he has written before.

Lets go back to the articles title:
Duterte 'admitted complicity' in Davao killings  WikiLeaks
Esmaquel basically tells us that Wikileaks suggest Dutertes complicity with DDS. However, Wikileaks ultimate source was Sipaco, who dismissed DDS claims as gossip AFTER the publication of the leaked cable.


Now, some camps will argue that Sipaco couldve been pressured by Duterte, but remember that Sipaco was under the protection of Liberal Party-led Malacaang from mid-2010 to mid-2016, and that the Liberal Party has repeatedly tried (and failed) to destroy Duterte during the campaign period [TP: Destroy Duterte].

A lowly city mayor can scare off someone fully backed by the Office of the President?

No, that claim shall not fly.

Matobatos Credibility
Paterno tried to resuscitate his article when he wrote:
Still, self-confessed killer Edgar Matobato, who was presented by De Lima, recently testified before the Senate that Duterte instructed the DDS to execute people.

The problem, however, is that Matobato has been proven to be a pathological liar.


Matobato has given several conflicting statements, three of which are cited here:

FIRST: Matobato confessed to killing certain Sali Makdum, whom Matobato claimed was an international terrorist targeted by DDS [GMA]. As it turns out, Makdum is Matobatos relative by marriage who wanted to buy land from Matobato [CNN]. Matobato was previously engaged in buying and selling of land.

SECOND: Matobato said DDS killed billionaire Richard King inside a McDonalds restaurant. The problem, however, is that Kings own family knows he was killed in an office building [Star].

THIRD: Matobato previously claimed to have not executed a sworn affidavit in 2014. As it turns out, he actually did, and the claims in that 2014 affidavit thoroughly contradict Matobatos claims in the Senate hearings [Star].

On 23 September 2016, Senate Justice Committee Chair Richard Gordon said, ""You have to test his credibility, you have to test his memory, you have to test events. And he was changing stories [ABS].""

Matobatos consistencies have also been pointed out by Senators Panfilo Lacson [Star], Manny Pacquiao [GMA], Alan Peter Cayetano [CNN], and Sonny Angara [Inq].

Meanwhile, the only ones who stand by Matobatos credibility are Senators Leila de Lima [CNN] and Antonio Trillanes [AJ].

De Lima backing Matobato is not a surprise: it was her who sneaked Matobato into the senate hearings to begin with. Her faith in Matobato was expected.

Trillanes, on the other hand, is the same senator who believed in hearsay when he accused Duterte of corruption during the last weeks of the campaign period, an accusation that he sorely failed to substantiate [TP: BangkoSerye].

So the only two senators backing Matobato is one who harbors a clear conflict of interest, and one who has cried Wolf! too many times.

Rapplers Paterno Esmaquel II
In the Rappler article, all Esmaquel did was add to the noise without adding value into the conversation. Esmaquel seriously lacks research skills, a basic skill thats expected from him, especially since he has a masters in Journalism and a bachelors in Communication, both from the Ateneo.

Mr. Esmaquel, Ateneo is a really good school. Thus, I will give the Ateneo the benefit of the doubt by saying that you just happen to be a statistical outlier.",RJ Nieto,"September 26, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/wikileaks-duterte-sipaco-dds-rappler-paterno-esmaquel.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Matobato kin speaks: Edgar a realtor, not a DC employee","A former Davao City employee claiming to be Matobatos relative denies the latters links with the Davao City Government.


Renante Matobato said, I can recall a distant relative from father's side by the name of Edgar Matobato. I refer to Edgar Matobato who recently testified before the Senate hearing on EJK.
Edgar Matobato is a witness in the ongoing senate investigations on extrajudicial killings headed by Sen. Leila de Lima. He claims to having been a part of the vigilante group Davao Death Squad, allegedly headed by President and former Davao City Mayor Rody Duterte.

In my entire government service with city government of Davao I cannot recall Edgar Matobato had worked there in any capacity or be it as member of the DDS which he claimed he is or was, Renante said.

In his senate testimony, Edgar Matobato claimed to be ""ghost employee"" of the Davao City Government [Star].
A ""ghost employee"" is someone on the city's payroll who doesn't actually perform work as defined by the employee's job description. This means, however, that Edgar Matobato's name should still be on the employee roster.

Renante was Legal Aide to Chiefs of the Barangay and Cultural Communities Affairs [PIA] and Traffic Management Center until he resigned in July 2005 to join the Public Attorneys' Office.

Edgar Matobato, a real estate agent?
Renante has met Edgar before.

""What I can recall though was at the time he worked in the LGU in Samal, Davao del Norte. I can also recall he was engaged in buy-and-sell of land in Samal because he approached me once to notarize a deed of sale which I cannot recall if I did,"" Renante said.

Samal is one of Davao's neighboring cities. It is not managed by the Davao City government.

Chef Duterte offers the Liberal Party a multi-course meal,"The Senate Hearing on Extrajudicial Killings is probably the cause of the recent rise in social media vitriol. I watched both camps insult each other while I munch on freshly-microwaved popcorn. I thought, Hmm, if thats what floats your boat, Ill leave you be.

I initially joined the mudslinging, until I realized that there are too many players in it already. Aint that fun anymore. Then I realized that I actually am interested in something else.

Instead of engaging in mindless arguments, I figured that I actually want to understand the status quo from a birds eye view. I am no political scientist so that bird wont fly very high, but Ill make it soar as high as my pedestrian brain can manage.

Why bother? Because I want to understand if this parade will last until 2022, or if it's the Liberal Party's last hurrah. Note, however, that is not an analysis that uses morality as metric: we already have too many self-proclaimed moralists (*cough* Rappler *cough*) to do that. Instead, I will be providing an article written with competing political interests in mind.

Lets go.

(DISCLAIMER: Para sa Grammar Nazi, mamaya na ako magpu-proofread dahil antok na antok na ako at pagod na pagod.)
Dutertes First 80 Days
Historically, Philippine presidents are given 100 days from the start of their term before the opposition or the mainstream media hits really hard. Interestingly, however, Duterte has not even reached his 100th day in office but the atmosphere feels like the heavens are about to spew brimstone and fire. If this were a sexual encounter, its as if everyone skipped foreplay and went right down to you-know-what.

I cant really blame the opposition for suddenly shifting from neutral to fifth gear, especially since Duterte himself instituted radical reforms as soon as he stepped into Malacaan.
In fewer than 100 days, Duterte has started turning the national political power structure upside down. Needless to say, many long-entrenched political players are not pleased. Particularly, the Liberal Party (LP) has suffered, is suffering, and will suffer the greatest casualties in Dutertes crusade against, well, pretty much everything.

The Liberal Partys Losses
A few days the May 2016 landslide win, Duterte said, Maybe when I sit as President, I am not going to prosecute. I am not up to it actually, going after political enemies [GMA]. Many Filipinos, including me, interpreted this as a declaration that he will not torment his predecessor as much as his predecessor tormented Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo [TP: PGMA freed].

Of course, LP didnt take Dutertes word for it. LP hoped to impeach him at the soonest possible time and have controversial VP winner [TP: Smartmatic] Leni Robredo, one of LPs own, installed in the Palace [TP: Leni]. Duterte extinguished this plan with the masterstroke that is Mark Villars appointment [TP: Plan B].
Well, I forgot that Duterte is a lawyer. Yes, there are no indications that Duterte will prosecute Aquino in the sense that no anti-Aquino court cases are in the works. But Duterte can hurt Aquino and the Liberal Party in so many other more creative and novel ways.

Lets list some of them, starting with Dutertes pre-inauguration offensive in the Lower House.

Some not-so-loyal LP members, realizing that impeachment has become impossible, started to jump ship. LP started feeling real pain as Dutertes PDP-Laban took advantage of the historically weak Philippine political party system. PDP-Laban rapidly whittled away LPs members, transforming what was formerly a congressional behemoth into a miniscule opposition bloc [Star].

Today, LP in the lower house is as toothless as a newborn baby. Yes, this hurt LP real bad.

Duterte hurting LP is like him serving LP a multi-course meal with appetizers, an entre, a main course, and a dessert.

Lets start with the appetizers.

Appetizer 1: LP and Mining
Duterte then gave Gina Lopez the DENR portfolio [MS], to the horror of the LP-leaning mining clique. Gina Lopez, a staunch anti-mining advocate, shut down four mines in her first week in office [Star]. This is bad news for many LP members who are deeply involved in the mining industry, such as its losing presidential bet Manuel Mar Roxas, who owns mining stocks in at least seven mining firms [TP: Roxas and Corruption].

About a week later, Lopez padlocked Palawans Berong Nickel [Bloomberg]. Nickel. Yes, nickel is another cause for alarm for LP as one of its major campaign donors, the illegal miner SR Metals, is a nickel miner [TP: Roxas Friend]. And yes, Lopezs anti-mining eyes are on SR Metals too [TV5], and Duterte will not stop her if she decides to tear up SR Metals license on National TV [TP: Miner Crony].


The mining clique is fuming, with Roxas ally Prospero Pichay [ABS] even going as far as calling Lopez crazy for her anti-mining stance [TV5].

Appetizer 2: LP and Hacienda Luisita
Duterte then gave Rafael Mariano the DAR portfolio [PIA], to the horror of LPs Cojuangcos who own the bloodstained Hacienda Luisita [TP: Luisita]. Mariano, head of a militant farmers group who was part of the Lower House, is known for authoring HB 155 which sought to repeal the Haciendas stock distribution option (SDO) [Star]. The SDO was what allowed the Cojuangcos to evade land reform laws.

A week into his post, Mariano swiftly ordered Hacienda Luisita Inc. to stop harassing its farmers [MS]. A month later, he vowed to destroy Haciendas [MS]. True to his word, he ordered the much-delayed redistribution of 358 hectares of Hacienda Luisita Land [MB]. This is still a miniscule section of Hacienda Luisita that covers thousands of hectares [Stuart-Santiago 2012]. Note, however, that Mariano still has six more years in DAR so he can still do a lot more damage.

Appetizer 3: LP appointees go bye-bye
After Duterte took his oath of office, he appointed Eddie Monreal [TV5] to replace the much-reviled Airport Chief and Aquino relative Jose Honrado [MT]. Honrado was widely blamed for the Laglag-Bala airport scam [CNN].

Nicanor Faeldon was made Bureau of Customs (BoC) chief [CNN], replacing Aquino appointee Alberto Lina [PC]. Faeldon is intent on cleaning up the Customs Bureau, a milking cow of corrupt public officials. He earlier said, If I have to kill one of your officials, every opportunity I get, I will do that if that is the only way you want to reform this Bureau [MB].

True to his word, Faeldon installed CCTVs on every nook and cranny of BoC. He even set up a live stream of the CCTV cameras in his own BOC office for the public to see [GMA]. So far, at least one BoC employee has been arrested after being caught on CCTV accepting bribes [GMA].


These are just a few of Dutertes hard-hitters. But to top it all off, Duterte recently issued Memorandum Circular No. 4 s. 2016, which demands the courtesy resignations of all Aquino appointees. He prefaced the memo with In view of the Presidents desire to rid the bureaucracy of corruption, so you know what he means [Gov].

Enough of the Appetizers!
The preceding sections are just some of the appetizers, the radical reforms happening under the Duterte Administration. There are many others that I cannot mention anymore because I am writing an article, and not a booklet.
Regardless, the previous sections demonstrate that Dutertes crusade against corruption is hitting LP, and it is hitting real hard. The Liberal Party is hurting. With a Duterte-led Malacaan, LP can look forward to grimmer days ahead. Reducing LP membership, angering LP financiers, infuriating LPs Cojuangcos, enraging LPs appointees these are just appetizers.

Enough of the appetizers: its time for the entre and the main course!

For the entre, Duterte offers the international policy realignment.

For the main course, Duterte offers the War on Drugs.

Lets talk about it in greater detail.

Entre: International Policy and the South China Sea
One of former President Aquinos would-have-been legacies is his much-publicized crusade against what he believes is Chinese bullying in the South China Sea [Inq]. Using Chinas harassment of poor Filipino fishermen, Aquino initiated arbitral proceedings against China, massively straining China-Philippines ties [TP: Davila].


Little did we know that he was against China primarily because his staunch ally, First Pacific Director and Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, wanted to drill for South China Sea hydrocarbons [TP: MVP]. Del Rosario business partner Manny V. Pangilinan controls most of mainstream media [TP: Reed Bank], so I am not really surprised at how such an enormous conflict of interest issue has never been covered by mainstream media [TP: Worse than Karen].

Duterte, however, never bothered to control mass media. Instead, he hit LP where it hurts the most.

The recent favorable decision from the Permanent Court of Arbitration would have been the Aquino administrations crowning glory, it would have been their legacy. However, Duterte chose not to go hardline with it [TP:Yasay], choosing a more practical and independent diplomatic strategy [TP:ASEAN], to Chinas delight and to Americas chagrin.

Yes, the Philippines decided to take a different trajectory in international affairs. What was once an American lapdog during the Aquino Era is now a country that has finally started asserting its sovereignty.

Unfortunately for LP, Dutertes neutral stance on the China-US geopolitical tug-o-war means Philex Petroleum will never get to drill Northwest of Palawan. MVPs struggling Philex Petroleum appears to have realized this even before Duterte sat in Malacaan, after the company announced its plans to venture in renewable energy [Star].

Years worth of Aquinos (un)diplomatic efforts translated to nothing.

And now, its time for the main course.

Main Course: The War on Drugs
Not even 40 days into office, Duterte did the unprecedented: he named public officials with suspected drug links PUBLICLY. He started with five PNP Generals [TP: Robredo], then followed it up with over a hundred mayors, judges, et Al [TP: List]. The generals he named are connected with the Liberal Party. Meanwhile, many of the names he mentioned from the list are big ticket LP members, such as Ilo-ilos Jed Mabilog, a cousin of LP stalwart Senator Franklin Drilon [Politiko].

Suspicions of LPs complicity in the illegal drug trade first arose in May 2010 when its treasurer, Quezon Governor Rafael Nantes was suspected of drug links [Balita]. Luckily for LP, he conveniently died in a chopper crash a couple of weeks later [Star].

Aquino never raised the drug issue in any of his six State of the Nation Addresses [TP: Narcopolitics], and for good reason. Illegal drugs flourished in the Philippines under the Aquino Administration [TP: China to the Streets]. Bilibid, the countrys maximum-security prison, became the shabu (meth) capital of the country [TP: 400 deaths].


Oh! And did I mention the itchy LP Senator Leila de Lima [TP: Oooh, Ronnie!]?

Yes, Philippine Narcopolitics is real, and reports suggest that LP is largely behind it. The war on drugs will be LPs biggest headache. In a meal that Chef Duterte prepared, this is the main course.

Yummy!

LP counter-attacks
LP is doing the best it can to survive by trying to pin on Duterte the vigilante killings of the past couple of months. LP Senator Leila de Lima, who tag-teamed with former LP Secretary-General and now Human Rights chair Chito Gascon [TP: CHR], initiated a Senate Investigation that purportedly intends to aid legislation.

The first couple of hearings turned out to be a dud [TP: Destroy Duterte], reinforcing my suspicion that this is more of an anti-Duterte publicity stunt. However, there still was a small part of me that wanted to believe that these two LP peeps may just be suckers for unconditional human rights.

But my doubts vanished after de Lima introduced Edgar Matobato. Matobatos testimony was shockingly riveting. As part of the Davao Death Squad, Matobato suggested that Duterte terrorizes his political rivals after he testified that he kidnapped and murdered four of Duterte rival Prospero Nograless bodyguards [GMA]. This is just one of the many horrid things that Matobato described.

But theres something that doesnt add up.

The Nograles camp denied the occurrences of such kidnappings [GMA], let alone the murders. Moreover, Matobatos testimony is inconsistent with a previous interview. He told the Senate he kidnapped four Nograles bodyguards, but he said he kidnapped five in an earlier interview with The Telegraph UK [Video]. Moreover, it appears that Matobato is not even a Davao City native as he claims [SunStar].

Matobato and WPP
Yes, Matobato is a liar.

Whats worse, Matobato was under the Department of Justice (DoJ) Witness Protection Program (WPP) in 2014 [CNN], where de Lima was still its Secretary, only to leave in January 2016 [Straits]. Matobato said he left WPP in fear of the Duterte Presidency, but Aquino was still president in January and Duterte was trailing the electoral surveys at the time [CNN].

And it appears that de Lima is lying too. Yup, a classic LP strategy.

Last month, de Lima admitted that the CHR failed to file cases against Duterte or his aides for lack of evidence. De Lima said, We dont have enough evidence against them. There [was] no one to execute a sworn affidavit to prove the existence of the death squad [MT].

Hold on one sec! Matobato has been under WPP, under DoJ Sec. de Limas custody, since 2014. He stayed in there for almost two years, consuming precious public resources. Two years in WPP yet he did not even execute a sworn testimony? When the fact of the matter is that he got into the WPP because of his revelations on Duterte to begin with?

Yup. This senate investigation is not really a quest for the truth, but one of the last kicks of the dying political horse that is that Liberal Party.

And now... the end is near... and so I face... the final curtain...

Why did I say that LP is dying? Watch this:

Duterte and 3000 Deaths: Did Hitler inspire the Liberal Party?,"Yes, that's Adolf Hitler in the middle. You'll learn why.
Note: mamaya ko na to ipu-proofread. Antok na ako e.


The plausibility of a scientific theory relies on how good it fits data. Thats how science works. When a theory starts to fail at explaining new data, its time to reject it.
For example, Newtons Laws were the best there is for over 200 years. Theyre simple, straightforward, and they dont require advanced math. However, the discovery of exotic behavior of subatomic particles and the constancy of the speed of light, physicists discovered that Newtons Laws dont hold at very small scales or very high speeds.

As a result, Max Plancks Quantum Theory and Albert Einsteins Theory of General Relativity were born to takeover Newtons Laws at very small scales and at very high speeds, respectively [History, History].
Human rights groups have been accusing Duterte of sanctioning extrajudicial killings since god-knows-when, but they have ramped up their rhetoric since Dutertes June 30th oath of office.

I am against extrajudicial killings myself, and the fact remains that at this point in the article, the Duterte-killed-them-all Theory still holds.

So why don't we put it under the microscope?

Specifically, the oppositions theory explaining the numerous deaths can be stated as:
Dutertes words have the force and effect of law, so that his exceptionally harsh words against criminals led to a staggering number of casualties over past two-and-a-half months.
Now, its time to break down this theory and see how well it explains known data.

1: Force and effect of law
Senator Risa Hontiveros argued that the presidents words have the force and effect of policy [SunStar]. That is, whatever Duterte says becomes official policy. Now, lets recall what Duterte said this year:
Feel free to call the police, or do it yourself if you have a gun In an arrest, you must overcome the resistance of the criminal. And if he fights (if) he fights to (the) death, you can kill him. Just follow that. Only if your life is in danger and the criminal is armed and hostile, shoot him, and I will give you a medal [TP: 400 Deaths].
Going by Hontiveros logic, does it mean that Duterte is actually against extrajudicial killings?

He has repeated these instructions numerous times, including last week during one of his speeches. But then, these instructions fits perfectly to established jurisprudence enabling legal warrantless arrests [TP: Warrantless].
Besides, lets take a look at former President Aquino whom Sen. Hontiveros is arguably a fan of.
A Taclobanon who almost died from a shooting incident amidst the post-Yolanda looting and violence told Aquino his story.

Aquino scoffed, Eh buhay ka pa naman, di ba (Youre still alive, anyway)? [Star]
Senator Hontiveros, are you also implying that Aquinos indifferent words have the force and effect of law too? That Aquino's apathy for the plight of the common man was actually part of state policy? Does Roxas' statement that Aquino was best president ever imply that Roxas also believes in an apathetic government?

Sen. Hontiveros' axiom contradicts itself. That is, the presidents words having the force and effect of law is wishful thinking on Sen. Hontiverospart.

2: Exceptionally harsh words
Now, lets take a closer look at Dutertes diabolic threats to criminals, such as when he said hell dump the bodies of criminals into Manila Bay, or the downright scary, I will kill you. Is this legal, or is Duterte breaking the law by uttering these lines?

As a regular citizen, if this is the price to pay for an unprecedented mass surrender of criminals [ATimes], I do not really mind. Weve used pretty words since 2010, and look where it got us. Do words kill? No. They scare, but they do not kill. I couldnt care less.

Duterte said last week, I have every right to threaten criminals (but) how it develops to the endgame is another problem [Video].
I do not know if the reader needs further spoon-feeding but I think its quite clear that he says his threats end in threats. Unless somebody can provide me evidence that he indeed ordered the killing of a suspected criminal, this issue about his exceptionally harsh words do not really mean anything to me.

Now, has the opposition cited even one instance where Duterte ordered a successful extra-legal killing?

No.

Dear Opposition, toughen up a bit. Life is not rainbows and butterflies. Spare me from the bullsh*t.

3: Staggering number of casualties
If were just going to look at the absolute figures then yes, the numbers are staggering. The problem, however, is that this observation means little if we will not take into consideration the magnitude of the problem.

Think of it this way:
Using general anesthesia before a tooth extraction is just stupid. But if youre getting a multi-organ transplant, using local anesthesia would be stupider.
PDEA estimated in June 2016 that there are at least three million drug addicts in the Philippines [Inq]. Of this figure, a total of 709,527 surrendered as of 11 September 2016, where 52,568 are drug pushers and 656,959 are drug users.

Most of these people surrendered voluntarily, while 16,025 were arrested during anti-drug operations. These anti-drug operations resulted in 1,466 deaths, or roughly half of about 3,000 who died since 30 June 2016 [TV5].

The figures above show that law enforcement operations resulted in 16,025 arrests and 1,466 deaths, translating to roughly 1 death per 11 successful arrests. For a regular citizen like me whos not used to seeing violence first-hand, and given our perennially under-equipped and under-funded police force, that death-to-arrest rate doesnt look that bad.
If the Philippine drug problem was a surgery, it would be a multi-organ transplant that requires a powerful anesthetic, and figures suggest that we have a pretty good anesthesiologist on duty.

Given the magnitude of the drug problem, I even find it interesting that only 3,000 were killed, which pales in comparison to Mexicos war on drugs [PBS].


Imagine youre getting a facial treatment and the last facial you had was a decade ago, would you complain if the facialist gets a bucketful of whiteheads and blackheads?

If you answered yes, then please come over here and I will smack some sense into you.

Super-duper Liberal Party
Super-duper is not really part of my vocabulary, but I was inspired to use it after learning that the Supreme Courts Public Information Office seemingly watched too many reruns of Lindsay Lohans Mean Girls.

If Duterte indeed sanctions extrajudicial killings, why would the police bother to arrests that many? Why wont the police just shoot them all? It doesnt add up.

I think it goes without saying the Liberal Party has more than enough financial, logistic, and political muscle, to do its bidding, even up to this day.
With such as staggering number of casualties, I cannot help but wonder why it has so far failed to get enough evidence to prove that Duterte indeed perpetrated these assassinations.

Has the Liberal Party lost its steam? I do not think so, because a large number of Liberal Party members are implicated in the drug trade. Just look at LP attack dog PNP General Garbo and and LP attack b*tch Senator Leila de Lima.

It is in LPs interest to find enough evidence to bring Duterte down. Besides, Vice-president Leni Robredo is from the Liberal Party too. Why hasnt LP gone the extra mile to find enough evidence that would catapult them back to Malacaang?


So far, there can only be one explanation: they cant find any.


ThinkingPinoy's Takeaways 
The Liberal Party-controlled Commission on Human Rights has hounded Duterte with allegations since 2009, it has been aggressively looking for evidence since then. So far, not a single case was filed against Duterte, for the sheer reason that there's no evidence linking him to these extrajudicial, extralegal killings [TP: PLeni].

The Liberal Party, and the Liberal Party-controlled mainstream media, loves mentioning the ""Rule of Law"".  But isn't it true that the rule of law dictates that one is innocent until proven guilty? LP can't even find a single piece of evidence pinning Duterte, yet here they are telling the entire world that Duterte is a megalomaniac butcher. What's worse, they have been using that same fallacious allegation over, and over, and over.

Basically, despite their inability to find even probable cause, let alone a court conviction, LP is trying to convince the world that Duterte is a mass murderer simply by repeating the same allegation across every conceivable mass communication platform on the planet.

This reminds me of Adolf Hitler's ""Big Lie"" propaganda technique, as explained in Mein Kampf, involves using a lie so colossal that no one would believe that someone could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. This concept eventually evolved into the statement, ""A lie, when repeated often enough, becomes the truth.""[JVL]

Duterte's Philippines breaking away from the United States?,"Duterte shifted geopolitical tides during the 2016 ASEAN Summit.


But before I go into that, it's important to get a little bit of context.


On July 21st and barely over a week after the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) decided on the South China Sea (SCS) issue, President Rodrigo Duterte asked US Ambassador Philip Goldberg, Are you with us or are you not with us?, to which Goldberg answered, Only if you are attacked.

Goldbergs answer is technically correct: thats how the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) is worded.

But theres a problem.

How the 1951 PH-US MDT works
Judging from the official text of the MDT [GovPH] and from the point of view of the Philippines, the MDT algorithm basically works like this:
First: try to settle international disputes through peaceful means.
Second: Filipinos will develop, with US help, its capacity to resist armed attack.
Third: Filipinos and American will talk regularly regarding threats.
Fourth: If an armed attack happens, United States will respond.
Fifth: If an armed attack happens, refer the issue to the UN Security Council.
The operative word here is armed attack, which the MDT defines as an [GovPH]:
an armed attack on either of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the metropolitan territory of either of the Parties, or on the Island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific Ocean, its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific
Public vessel means a non-commercial vessel owned or bareboat chartered and operated by the Republic of the Philippines, and political subdivision thereof [P.D. 600].
With this definition, attacks on Filipino commercial fishing vessels, which has become quite common, will not trigger MDT.

Triggering the MDT
Dutertes question, however, less about whether the US will go to war with us and more about whether will take a stronger, pro-Philippines stance in as far as our South China Sea assertions.

That is, it appears that in that question to Goldberg, Duterte, in between the lines, asked, Will the US help us enforce the PCA ruling?


The answer, clearly, is no. But how did Goldbergs seemingly favorable answer become a no?

The South China Sea issue is a sea dispute and the nearest undisputed Philippine terrestrial territory is the shore of Palawan Island over 100 kilometers away. Going by terms of the MDT, the only way to trigger it is through sending a Filipino public vessel (coast guard, navy, whatever). Given the dismal state of Philippine naval forces, we will be basically sending that public vessel to its doom.

Yes, Duterte may have to sacrifice Filipino lives just to trigger MDT.
I personally doubt that it will go that far. A full scale war between the United States and China is unlikely because of terribly complex and potentially apocalyptic geopolitical and economic ramifications on both sides. Besides, just imagine the prospective consternation of Chinas massive and rising middle class. Its just too complicated.

But just because war is unlikely doesnt mean were already okay: Goldbergs tacit no means a lot more than that.

SCS Resource Exploitation
Ambassador Goldbergs answer Only if you are attacked. has at least one more important and more practical implication: SCS resource exploitation rights.

Fish is an important resource and competition over dwindling fish stocks [NatGeo] has been pointed out as one of the triggers of the dispute [TheDiplomat], where Chinese fishermen are forced to venture further south to find more fish. Yes, fewer fish might have triggered Chinese aggression, but I highly doubt that China will risk going to the brink of war just because of fish.

Aggression? Yes. War? No.

So what is it? Hydrocarbons, i.e. oil and natural gas. Energy Security, of course.
Philex Petroleums 2011 attempt to exploit Reed Bank, which is a part of the contested area, is the open secret that catalyzed the PCA case [TP: Trillanes DFA and MVP], and everything thats happening right now revolves around the PCA decision.

Now, suppose Philex Petroleum unilaterally asserts our sovereign rights over the 200-mile EEZ by starting to drill for oil or natural gas on Reed Bank and it sends ships there. The Chinese Navy can simply blow up those ships without fear of triggering the 1951 PH-US MDT.


Oil exploration ships are commercial in nature so they do not qualify as public vessels per MDT.

There is no viable way for the Philippines to defend ourselves by ourselves. We all know that, so MDT is crucial.

How about navy escorts?
Some camps may argue that we can send navy or coast guard ships to escort Philex Petroleums oil exploration ships. However, China can simply blow up oil exploration ships and leave the navy or coast guard ships unscathed. Technically, that wont trigger MDT either, because the Chinese would have attacked only commercial ships.

Actually, China doesnt even have to be that dramatic.

All they need to do is park their vessels right on top of the area to be explored (or drilled). That would be more than enough to prevent Philex Petroleum from doing anything.

What can Philex do? Can Philex or the navy force them to get out of there? No.

Yes, there will be a confrontation but no, there wont be any armed attacks, because all China need to do is sit still, and I am pretty confident that China has enough ships to cover a sufficiently large area.

The bottom line: Without being friendlier to China, Filipinos will never be able to exploit South China Sea oil.

Put*ng Ina and the ASEAN Summit
Duterte is prone to emotional outbursts: everybody knows that. Thats why at first, I felt that the recent son of a b*tch incident [CBS] was one of those. However, Dutertes subsequent actions appear to show a deeper, underlying reason.

Lets recount key events after that incident:

1: Postponement of US-PH meeting
The United States wanting to postpone the meeting is a given [WSJ]. Whats more interesting however, is the Philippines agreement with this decision to postpone. Instead of appealing to the US for consideration, the Philippines suddenly found the proverbial balls to stand its ground.

Duterte, however, pushed through with a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang [CNN] and another meeting with Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev [PCO] That is, Duterte didnt meet with the US, but he still met with China and Russia, the USs two fiercest rivals.

2: Duterte skips ASEAN-India summit
Citing migraine, Duterte then decided to skip the ASEAN-US and ASEAN-India summits, where ASEAN leaders met with the US and Indian governments, respectively [NDTV].

Duterte skipping the ASEAN-US summit wouldn't have been that much of an issue if the cursing incident is considered. That's kind of expected, you know. However, the fact that he also skipped the ASEAN-India summit reinforces my suspicions that he really wants friendlier relations with China.


While China-India relations saw an upswing when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited India in 2014 [TheDiplomat], the relations between two countries are historically problematic, with border disputes being first on the list [IndiaExpress]. Moreover, India supports the Philippines on the South China Sea dispute [InToday].

Duterte was expected to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi [Star], but the meeting didnt push through.

3: Dutertes apology to Obama, sort of
Duterte said in a statement that he regrets that his remarks have caused much controversy, but he also said that the Philippines wants to assert the intent to chart an independent foreign policy and promote closer ties with all nations [DFA handout].

Despite Duterte and Obama shaking hands later on [PTV], the written apology, while still a de facto apology, is measuredly half-assed.

Dutertes written statement states the Philippines intent to take a neutral stance on the US-China tug-o-war, as opposed to a generally pro-US policy that is has adopted since time immemorial.

4: Duterte on the ASEAN-East Asia Summit
The ASEAN-East Asia Summit, more commonly called the ASEAN Plus Three (10+3) Summit, is a meeting between ASEAN and the East Asian countries China, Japan, and South Korea [MB].

Despite Duterte raising the issue of Rule of Law over the South China Sea, he decided not to mention the controversial PCA ruling at any point in the entire summit. This should, at least slightly, please China.

Some may argue that any mention of the South China Sea will strain PH-CN ties. However, judging from how Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua positively reacted to Dutertes borderline offensive jokes during the latters National Heroes Day speech [Video], it seems that China and Duterte have built a certain level of trust that affords the latter more rhetorical leeway.

To top it all off, Duterte had the gall to stray from a prepared speech as he reportedly cited  in front of ASEAN and East Asian leaders  US atrocities in the Philippines from 1898 to 1946. One delegate described the atmosphere in the room as ""quiet and shocked"" [TV5].

Essentially, Dutertes message is akin to The Philippines will not be a US lapdog anymore, but we will not turn into Chinas lapdog either.

Dutertes Geopolitical Risk-taking
Anti-Duterte camps may simply dismiss these actions as disturbing evidences of Dutertes excessive testosterone levels or worse, sheer ignorance of international policy. However, if the probable consequences of his actions in the past several days are to be considered, it appears that Duterte is playing his cards effectively.

I spoke with International Relations scholar Sass Rogando Sasot of The Hagues Leiden University about this issue.

Sasot explained that Duterte is trying to assert ASEAN leadership. ASEAN members are all aware of the Americans lack of moral ascendancy over ASEAN. ASEAN knows that the US economy is sputtering so its better to look for opportunities somewhere else, such as China. They see the Americans as an obstacle towards partnering with China, with the Philippines as the American lap dogs.

Among the ASEAN members, the Philippines and Thailand are, historically, staunch allies of the United States. Thailand, while still a US ally, is not as close to the US as it once was. That is, the Philippines is the only ASEAN member who believes in American Supremacy.

Everyone is already orbiting China and the only thing that the US can dangle to the ASEAN countries is a security guarantee against China. But if the Philippines and China can patch things up, what would that US military bargaining chip be useful for?, Sasot said.

That is, if we are friendly with China, then theres no need for security anymore.

PH economy hurting?
Some camps say the Philippine stock market suggests at least a minor stock market crash because of the Duterte gaffe [Indep]. Recently, however, markets across Asia have been generally weak, and the PSEi has even experienced a modest 0.63 percent uptick yesterday [BW].

Moreover, only 25% of Filipinos are financially literate [MT], so such downturns in the stock market should not affect the average Filipino family as much as, say, an American household, if the same thing were to happen to Dow Jones.

Sasot said, The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is dead. The US cannot even persuade the European Union to impose sanctions against China after the latters alleged cybercrimes.

On the cybercrime issue, the US settled for a rather underwhelming truce with China [BBC].

Duterte opened a new era in ASEAN politics, Sasot said.

As to whether this new era is good or bad for the Philippines, Sasot and I agreed that while Duterte is on a very manageable track, its best to wait for things to unfold.",RJ Nieto,"September 9, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/dutertes-philippines-US-ASEAN-Summit-2016.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
"Warrantless Arrests? Presidential Communications cites ""wrong"" law","I support the Duterte Administration, but I criticize it when criticism is due, so here I go.

Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Assistant Secretary (ASec.) Ana Marie Banaag held a conference earlier today to explain President Rodrigo Dutertes memorandum realting to the declaration of a State of Lawless Violence in the country.


Banaag read a memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea.

Among other things, the memorandum stated:
No civil or political rights are suspended during the existence of a state of lawless violence. In particular, no warrantless arrests shall be effected unless the situation falls under any of the following circumstances among others:

 when the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense in the presence of the arresting officer.

 when an offense has just been committed and an arresting officer has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested has committed the offense.

 when the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined where his case is pending.

 when the person arrested, or to be arrested, has voluntarily waived his right against warrantless arrest.
After reading the entire statement, Banaag accepted follow-up questions from the media corps. The first question was from Leila Salaveria from the Philippine Daily Inquirer.
Salaveria asked,  The rules on frisking, checkpoints, instances of warrantless arrests are these actually newly crafted rules or already existing in laws and rules?

Banaag answered, Theyre already existing. In fact, they are based on the constitution and based on the Revised Penal Code. So whether the proclamation (of the State of Lawless Violence) was issued or not, they still take effect. It (warrantless arrests) is still part of the law of the land.

Therein lies the problem.

Citing the Constitution
What Banaag said was mostly true, however

The constitution is the supreme law of the land, but its incorrect to cite the constitution out of the blue. Why? Because many provisions in the constitution include the phrase as defined by law or as provided by law. This means that the provision require the enactment of an addition enabling law before it takes real-life effect.

For example, Article II, Section 26 of the 1987 Constitution specifically states:

The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.
The constitution prohibits political dynasties but political dynasties abound. Why? Because there is yet to be an enabling law for this constitutional provision.
Banaag should have simply skipped citing the constitution and went straight to citing a specific Republic Act or Court Rule.

And she actually did, but theres another problem.

Revised Penal Code? Not exactly
Aside from citing the constitution, Banaag also said warrantless arrests are based on the Revised Penal Code, otherwise known as Republic Act 3815.

There's a problem with this statement: the Revised Penal Code, while allowing for warrantless arrests, does NOT provide the specific exceptions to the prohibition on warrantless arrests.

The only most relevant provision on warrantless arrests in the Revised Penal Code is Article 269 which states:
Art. 269. Unlawful arrest.  The penalty of arresto mayor and a fine not exceeding 500 pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, in any case other than those authorized by law, or without reasonable ground therefor, shall arrest or detain another for the purpose of delivering him to the proper authorities.chanrobles virtual law library [RPC Art. 269].
Art. 269 states there may be exceptions to the requirement of arrest warrants, but it does not actually say what those provisions are.

RPC is correct, but it's not the best answer.

Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure? Yes.
Is there really a law or rule that allows warrantless arrests?

Yes, its the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 113, Section 5, which states:
Section 5. Arrest without warrant; when lawful.  A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:
(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;
(b) When an offense has just been committed, and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and
(c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.
In cases falling under paragraph (a) and (b) above, the person arrested without a warrant shall be forthwith delivered to the nearest police station or jail and shall be proceeded against in accordance with section 7 of Rule 112. (5a)

Sounds familiar?

Yes. This is pretty much the same words included in the memorandum, except that Sec. Medialdeas memo didnt mention the name of the law upon which the statements were based.

In short, its not the Revised Penal Code. Instead, its the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, Rule 133, Section 5.

Why does it matter?
So Banaag cited the wrong law, but does this issue really matter?
First, members of the opposition love to point out even the most trivial flaws in the Duterte Administration, so its essential to not give them additional ammunition.

Second, policemen and other law enforcement authorities may use Banaags inaccurate statement to justify warrantless arrests. We do not want these brave men to look stupid, of course.

Third, public confidence in the governments competence is essential in any successful state. In the case of the Presidential Communications Office, its their job to be as accurate as possible when conveying the presidents messages.

With these said, I suggest that the PCO issue a notice on its Facebook Page to clarify this issue as soon as possible.",RJ Nieto,"September 7, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/warrantless-arrests-presidential.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Why did Duterte supporters bash Rapplers Pia Raada?,"Miss Pia Raada-Robles, let me explain why you got bashed.


At 9:16 PM last night, Duterte Today (DT) posted a status update claiming that the Roxas Night Market, the site of the fateful bombing incident, has resumed business on the evening of 04 Sept 2016.


Two hours later in the comments section, Rappler reporter Pia Raada-Robles asked:
Hi Duterte Today! May I know what date and time these photos were taken? I just came from Roxas Avenue and I didn't see this. It was an empty street, save for the shrine and a few vendors. (see my photo below taken around 11 pm on Sept 4, 2016)
Duterte Today readers took offense on your post and you got bashed as a result, with some commenters even going as far as calling you bugo, which is Bisaya for idiot.
Then this morning, Raada-Robles replied on that same comment thread with:
Hello! The Roxas Night Market, from what I remember, ends at 12 am. That is why I asked what time the photos were taken because normally it would have still been open by the time I had arrived. I don't understand where the malice is in my question as some of the commenters have been imputing. I asked the question in order to obtain more answers and clarifications about the situation. Asking questions is what reporters do. What's the problem?
I am not really sure if understanding context clues, or even the ability to read previous comments is part of, as Raada-Robles puts it, what reporters do. However, if she actually bothered to read the comments, the answers are already there.
Let me spell this out for Raada-Robles not only for her benefit but also for the benefit of every member of the national mainstream media who may have probably experienced the same.

So, Ms. Pia Raada-Robles, let me spell this out for you.

Major Trust Issues
I think Rapplers general reputation is hardly debatable from the point of view of the Duterte crowd, and you know what I mean. Just look at how your organization tried to irresponsibly stir up the anti-Duterte noise just a few days before the elections with your poorly-researched Duterte P. Guevarra Property article [TP: P Guevarra].

You commented on Duterte Today, a Duterte-leaning page, so you can expect a Duterte-leaning crowd to read your comment. And thats exactly what happened. The Duterte crowd isn't very fond of Rappler, then add the fact that the Duterte crowd generally doesnt like you in particular.
Let me cite two examples.

In June 2016, you disrespected Duterte in front of his face [TP: Big Ego]. Yes, you can argue the justifications for your actions, but the fact remains that Duterte supporters will see it at an act of condescension against the president. They will obviously not like you for that.

You say that you are a reporter.

Now, a reporters job is to relay the news, and not pretend to be a part of the morality police. Reserve that for opinion-editorial (Op-Ed) columnists, and you werent in that press conference in that capacity.

In August 2016, in another Rappler article, you reported what you perceived to be Dutertes threat to Chief Justice Sereno [TP: Martial Law]. Instead of just reporting what happened like whats expected from news reporters, you editorialized that article. To make matters worse, your insights leave much to be desired.

Stated simply, Rapplers reputation, plus your recent history, makes Duterte supporters distrust you. Thats why Duterte supporters will interpret your words with greater suspicion, words that would have been innocuous if asked by someone from, say, Mindanation or SunStar Davao.

I am not saying that Duterte supporters are justified in their decision to distrust you. Instead, I am saying that you should stop asking why they act that way because you should already know why.

Duterte supporters see you as a reporter with a questionable agenda.

Trust can be rebuilt and you had the opportunity to do that in the comment, but you didn't take advantage of it.


Callousness versus Empathy
Communication is a two-way street. Quid pro quo. Give something before you ask someone to give something in return. When a crowd doesnt trust you, the least you can do is to empathize with them before you ask them to do your bidding.
Instead of prefacing your original comment with, I am really sorry for what happened and I sincerely want to understand the situation, you decided to go down to business right away. What message does that send? For a crowd who distrusts you, that translates to I do not care about your grief but I need this information.

Kyle Harland of the University of Wisconsin Center for Journalism Ethics wrote [UWisc]:

In the 1880s, Joseph Pulitzer hung a sign in the newsroom of his paper, the New York World, which read: The World has no friends. But this view of traditional objectivity in journalism is outdated.

A major reason for this is that the journalists ability to understand and connect with people is essential for learning about stories, and compassion allows journalists to do this more fully. In our current media environment that so often deals with victims of tragedy, a sense of compassion undoubtedly plays a part in journalists ability to understand people in the news.

You failed to show empathy. You failed to show compassion. Hence the readers animosity towards you.

Yes, I have chosen to use pointed language in my articles against mainstream journalists in the past several months, and I think your organization is well aware of that. The problem, however, is that journalists are expected to be thicker-skinned. Regular citizens, on the other hand, are not expected to be such.

Pia, set aside your spoiled brat mentality, be more sensitive of the plight of the tragedys victims, and you will be pleasantly surprised at how the crowd will react to you.

Prudence, or the lack of it
Your original Duterte Today comment can be broken into these bits:
First, you asked DT the exact time they took the Roxas Avenue pictures.
Second, you said it isnt consistent with a photo you took that showed a practically deserted Roxas Avenue.
Third, you showed the photo you took.
Your comment, in general, wants to verify the authenticity of DTs post. Fair enough.

The first bullet mentioned above is more than enough to elicit the information you needed. That is, you could have just said, Hi Duterte Today! May I know what date and time these photos were taken?

It wouldve saved you a lot of trouble if you just stopped right there. But that wasnt enough for you. You felt (and heeded the) need to say its already practically deserted by 11 pm, with the photos to show for it, even if it was neither the right time nor the right place to say such a thing.

Your naivete or worse, your need to prove yourself right, got the better of you. While the second and third points were valid, they only served to put the DT sympathizers on the defensive, as you tacitly imputed that DT is an unreliable news site.

DTs actual credibility is not the issue here. Instead, its the amalgamation of DT being one of the most vocal supporters of the tumultuous Duterte Campaign, and the trust that DT followers feel because of that.

Stated simply, your comment, aside from lacking compassion, also lacked prudence.

What is the Problem?
To wrap this article up, let me answer your follow up comment in the nicest possible way.

You said, Hello! The Roxas Night Market, from what I remember, ends at 12 am. That is why I asked what time the photos were taken because normally it would have still been open by the time I had arrived.

I say, Fair point, but you lacked empathy.

You said, I don't understand where the malice is in my question as some of the commenters have been imputing.

I say, The malice stems from their collective distrust on you and Rappler, your organization.

You said, I asked the question in order to obtain more answers and clarifications about the situation.

I say, ""That is also correct, but you also asked for bashing when you gave too much information.""

You said, Asking questions is what reporters do. What's the problem?

I say, Because you basically acted like a self-entitled, self-absorbed prick. Thats the problem.

Miss Raada, a reporter is not just a reporter, she's expected to be human too. That's the problem.",RJ Nieto,"September 5, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/why-did-duterte-supporters-bash.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Potential Suspects: Who bombed Davao City?,"The Roxas Night Market is an extremely popular hangout place for Davaoeos. Located at the heart of downtown Davao, locals flock the place to find cheap and delicious eats, oftentimes in the company of family and friends. Its setup is similar to the Banchetto in Mandaluyongs Ortigas Center and the Midnight Mercato in Taguigs Bonifacio Global City.

September 2nd, a Friday, was another fun-filled day for Roxas Night Market regulars. That is, until around 10:00 PM when a bomb exploded, killing at least 14 people and injuring at least 60 others [ABS]. The entire nation was in shock. How can something like this happen in no less than the Presidents home town?



Potential Suspects
Davao City is close to my heart, and I have been grieving for two days. While I was born and raised in Luzon, it was my three years in Davao City that taught me how to be human. While I was born Tagalog, my heart is totally Bisaya.

But now that the smoke has slightly cleared, it is time to analyze the fateful incident and see what can be done about it. At this point, I will set aside everything I feel about the incident and examine the situation using nothing but logic and history.
Specifically, I will list down all the potential suspects, and examine, based on past news articles, the probability of each entity on the list being the actual culprit. Note that this is just a tentative list, but any investigation needs a starting point, and this is it.

This bears repeating: I will set aside all my emotions for now and I will evaluate the list as objectively as I can. Now, lets tentatively list down the possible suspects.
Duterte Administration
The Liberal Party
Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)
Drug Cartels
The United States
China
This is a pretty diverse list, right?

Let's start.

1st Suspect: Duterte Administration
This is the Yellow Fan Favorite.

Some members of the opposition would expectedly try to pin this incident on Duterte, as it can be compared to the August 1971 Plaza Miranda Bombing that killed nine and injured 95, mostly oppositionist Liberal Party supporters [LP]. The Liberal Party blamed then-President Ferdinand Marcos for the incident, alleging that the latter used it to justify the imposition of Martial Law [MT].

Incidentally, its also the Liberal Party whos in the opposition today. And this is what they would like us to believe this angle, especially since they are fond of painting Duterte as a megalomaniacal dictator-wannabe.

But theres a problem.
FIRST, Duterte has no thirst for power. Duterte has been offered the DILG post by former presidents Ramos, Estrada, Aquino, and Arroyo, and he declined all of them [AC, Inq], despite his full knowledge that the DILG post is the perfect springboard for running for higher office.

Duterte was also offered to be the 2016 vice-presidential running mate of Roxas [GMA] and Binay [GMA], but he declined. He was continuously pushed to run for president, but he declined every time, even going as far as saying only an alien abduction of Roxas, Binay, and Poe, will force to make him run [Inq], and it was only a last-minute large-scale, grassroots call for him to run [GMA] that finally changed his mind.


No, these are not the deeds of someone whos hungry for power.

SECOND, Davao City is Dutertes obra maestra. The man spent thirty years transforming an economic backwater into a booming cosmopolitan city. With Dutertes leadership, what was once a killing field in the late 80s turned into a safe and secure city with a vibrant economy [Edge].

At 71, its unlikely that he can leave a legacy more prominent than that, so why would he mess it up?

THIRD, Dutertes family lives in Davao. Why would he bomb a city where his children and grandchildren live? Why would he turn it into a hell-hole? It does not make sense.

If he really wanted to bomb a city for his alleged political motives, he wouldve bombed NCR cities instead. If I were Duterte and I wanted to a sequel to the Plaza Miranda Bombing, I wouldve bombed the Araneta Center, where the Liberal Party Headquarters is. But it isnt the case.

So no, Duterte probably didnt do it.

2nd Suspect: The Liberal Party
Many Duterte Die-hard Supporters say the Liberal Party did it. After all, the bombing fits perfectly into their plan. Despite the lack of evidence [TP: Gascon], the Liberal Party has managed to convince the international community that Duterte is a megalomaniac. With the bombing, and assuming that Duterte will declare Martial Law as a result, then LP would have succeeded in making him look not only megalomaniacal, but also dictatorial.

From the LP's point of view, this also happens to be the perfect diversion. The public has been feasting on LP Senator Leila de Lima and her alleged drug links, so the LP could have possibly copied former Senator Juan Ponce Enriles alleged Zamboanga Siege Tactic [Inq].

There is one major issue with this theory, however.
There is no evidence so far that suggests LPs complicity in the Davao City bombing incident. I am not Leila de Lima, so I do not like accusing without sufficient evidence. Yes, the motives are there, but motives alone are not enough to prove criminal liability.

LP as a potential suspect? Yes.

LP as the most probable suspect? No, not yet.

3rd Suspect: Abu Sayyaf Group
Prior to the incident, Duterte said the government has received threats from the IS-linked terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) [TP: Video]. The Philippine National Police (PNP) also blamed ASG for the bombing incident [AlJazeera].

Yesterday, ABS-CBN reported that ASG owned up to the Davao blast [ABS]. The problem, however, is the fact that ABS-CBN failed to include a direct quote from ASGs spokesman categorically saying that ASG did it. Not surprisingly, CNN reported this morning that ASGs spokesman categorically denied ASG alleged involvement in the bombing incident [CNN].

I hate to admit it, but ASGs denial makes some sense. Let me explain why.

FIRST, shrapnel found in the blast site are similar to ones found after the 2003 Sasa Wharf and Davao Airport Bombings [Sun.Star]. While this may qualify as circumstantial evidence, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are relatively low-tech bombs so the technology used in them is hardly proprietary. That is, even if the ASG can create such an IED, other groups can create similarly-designed IEDs too.

SECOND, ThinkingPinoy received a PNP internal memo dated 26 August 2016 that warns local police stations of a possible ASG bomb plot in Davao or Metro Manila. The memo is shown below:


The memo mentions suicide bombers. However, Davao was bombed using a standalone IED. That is, the PNP may be talking about a bomb threat thats totally separate from whatever happened last Friday.

THIRD and most importantly, Abu Sayyaf has never denied involvement with terrorist activities before.

Terrorists feed on terrifying the populace, so its just logical for them to own up to any successfully perpetrated terrorists attack. After all, thats just like getting extra street cred for free. I searched for any page published before 01 September 2016 that contains Abu Sayyaf denies [Google], and not a single article showed such an ASG denial in the past.

Whats the point? If ASG denied involvement, then it may actually be, at least partially, true.

The Duterte government has already been waging war on ASG for several weeks now, with Duterte reportedly planning to ramp up troops two days before the bombing incident [WSJ].

If I were the ASG, I would prefer a long protracted guerrilla war where troops trickle in, instead of an all-out government offensive that may overwhelm my terrorist forces. If I were ASG, I can more manageably resist government forces that way.


What would bombing Davao City do? That may just coax Duterte on going full-force against ASG, and thats the last thing ASG wants, and thats exactly what happened when Duterte announced Saturday  a few hours after the Davao bombing  that he will send 7,000 troops to eradicate ASG.

While I cannot totally discount ASGs involvement, the latters spokesterrorist actually makes at least a little sense when he denied the groups involvement.

4th Suspect: Drug Cartels
Regardless of whether youre for or against Dutertes war on drugs, the fact remains that it has yielded very tangible results, one of which is decreasing profit margins for drug syndicates [TP: PH Drug Industry].

Some may argue that bombings is not the style of drug cartels but the US military says otherwise [US Mil].

Now, Duterte is pretty difficult to assassinate, having survived terrorist-infested Mindanao for over 70 years. Thus, drug cartels can, at least for now, attempt to destabilize his government by bombing no less than his home town.

This is a very interesting angle given that three inmates bolted a North Cotabato prison just two weeks ago. These inmates were facing charges of illegal possession of explosives and illegal drugs [Inq].

Three drug dealers who happen to know something about explosives magically escaped prison. Two weeks later, an IED blast rocks Davao city, home of the president whos in the middle of the war against drugs.

Go figure.

5th Suspect: United States Government
The United States has been very critical of the Duterte Administrations war on drugs, going as far as insinuating that Duterte has a hand in the vigilante killings that has plagued the latters government for the past couple of months.

Just last week, its pro-war Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power tweeted, Alarming reports of ongoing extrajudicial killings in #Philippines; government must respect human rights and rule of law [Power].

Duterte is the first president since God-knows-when who took a neutral stance on the US-China rift. Since the South China Sea ruling, we have seen how Duterte chronically refused to definitively side with either. This is a welcome development for China in light of the severely antagonistic Aquino Administration.

But this is alarming for the US, as it has always been used to having Philippine presidents who are willing to kiss its ass on command. Vice-president Leni Robredo along with her political party is very much pro-US, and it would be theoretically more convenient for the Americans to have Robredo as president instead.

So why not do something to catalyze Dutertes political demise?

The communist New Peoples Army also blames the US for the Davao Bombings [Inq], but I do not want to give much credence to them, because the communists love to blame the US for everything. Besides, many Filipinos would scream, But the US is not a terrorist!

However, an incident from the relatively recent past suggests otherwise.

Michael Terrence Meiring
Meiring, a US citizen, was sharing a hotel room in Davao City with his ammonium nitrate bomb, which exploded on May 16, 2002. Meiring was severely injured; nevertheless, US government agents appeared at the hospital and spirited him away, first to Manila and then to the United States [AsiaTimes].

The Davao City Prosecution Office alleged that Meiring was a terrorist bomber [MindaNews], but the courts werent able to proceed with the case because Meiring has already been whisked out of the country by the US government itself before he can be arraigned.

""It was early in the morning when (then-US Amb.) Ricciardone flew here and met with me in a hotel here. He assured me then that they will conduct an investigation regarding the Meiring incident. Yet since then, the US government failed to fully explain to me how come they violated our sovereign right to prosecute Meiring who committed a crime here in our city,"" Duterte said in 2011 [Tesiorna].
Basically, in 2002, the US government coddled a terrorist who actually attempted to terrorize Davao City. So yes, the idea of US involvement in the 2016 Davao City Bombing is not far-fetched.


6th Suspect: Chinese Government
Another angle would be planted evidence, an angle that the opposition oh-so-gloriously loves to ignore when its convenient for them. This theory is pretty simple: the Chinese Government bombs Davao City and make it appear as if the United States did it, thereby tilting Dutertes stance on the China-US spat.

The problem with this theory, however, is that it's unlikely.

FIRST, because China is not widely-known for state-sponsored terrorism. Aside from a CATO Institute article insinuating otherwise, theres little documented evidence that China actually does that.

SECOND, because if it backfires, then China is toast. That is, the risks outweigh the benefits. If China indeed bombed Davao City and local investigators confirm this, then its over for PH-China relations for the foreseeable future, and it may even be used as a justification for a more decisive Western military presence in the South China Sea.

Thats something that China doesnt want, especially since they see Duterte as a bright spot for often-strained PH-China ties. I cannot imagine how China can be desperate enough to do it, so they probably didnt.

ThinkingPinoys Takeaways

These six potential suspects listed in this article are just theories and this article does not, in any way, definitively blame any of these six. Instead, I wrote this article to help you understand that the situation is not as simple as De Lima did it!. In as much as I want that woman to burn in hell, hasty generalizations are not my cup of tea.

So, who do you think did it?",RJ Nieto,"September 5, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/potential-suspects-who-bombed-davao-city.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Something's Fishy: Bogs Obuyes and the Deposit Slips,"I woke up this morning of 02 September 2016 and stumbled upon a Philippine Star exclusive that stated [Star]:
A bank document obtained by The STAR from a DOJ source showed that a total of P24 million in cash was deposited in a bank account under the name of Bogs C. Obuyes in March and April 2014.
Edna Bogs Obuyes was Senator Leila de Limas staff member while the latter was still the secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Then I felt like something's wrong.


NOTE: Obuyes is obviously a transgender man, so we will use male pronouns to address him throughout this article. 
The Philippine Star provided photos of the deposit slips, as shown  below:


A cursory look at the document, obtained from an anonymous DOJ source, shows several tell-tale signs of fraud.

FIRST,  18 April 2014 falls on a Good Friday, a bank holiday, so an over-the-counter bank transaction could not have been consummated on that day.


SECOND, ""Bogs"" is a nickname and banks require accountholders to use their real names.

THIRD AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, ""Diposits (sic)"" and ""24,000,000.00 millions  (sic)"" are glaring typographical errors that are not likely to be committed by presumably well-educated DoJ employees. Any self-respecting DOJ employee, especially if acting with Aguirre's imprimatur, would not have committed such glaring grammatical and spelling errors in a document of such importance.

Yes, something smells fishy.

Denials and Denials
A little before noon, I discovered a post from what presumably is Bogs Obuyes' personal facebook account. The post is as follows [FB]:


Obuyes' post quickly went viral. The knee-jerk reaction here would be, ""Wow, DOJ is so desperate to pin Sen. de Lima that they even resorted to manufacturing evidence!""

A couple of hours later, current Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said in Filipino, We are still verifying those documents because we do not want to be embarrassed [Star].
On one hand, the DOJ may have fabricated evidence. But on the other hand, it might be a trap that DOJ's opponents have set up.

So who's telling the truth?

A closer look at the documents shows some rather startling clues.

For the record, this article was written on 02 September 2016 at 5:00 PM.


Why is that important? Because the trick here is in the timestamps.

1: Time and Date of Publication
The Philippine Star said they got the deposit slips from an unnamed DOJ source, so their story should be an exclusive, i.e. they are the first news outlet to publish this story. The time stamp on the Philippine Star article states ""Updated September 2, 2016 - 12:00am"" or midnight last night. It doesn't really tell us much, as there had been an earlier version of this article.


However, looking further down at the Disqus comment section shows that the oldest comment, written by a Ros Feliciano, was 16 hours ago. It's 5:00 PM right now so ""16 hours ago"" should be anytime from 12:00 AM to 2:00 AM,  or some time after midnight last night.


This suggests that the time difference between the the first version and the second version shouldn't be too long. Why? Because updating an article does not reset the comments section. Surely, if the article was published during the daytime of 01 September 2016, somebody else would've already commented before that Ros Feliciano person.

Now, another tell-tale sign is in the hidden data of the graphic used in this article, which is the photo of the deposit slips. It is safe to assume that the photos were already there in the 1st version, and that the update merely affected textual content. Why? Because the photos are the most essential element to make such a leak credible.
Now, this is what I did:
Using Mozilla Firefox, I right-clicked on the photo of the deposit slip then selected ""Copy Image Location"".
On a new tab,  I pasted the image's address and pressed Enter.
The image loaded then I right-clicked the image again then selected ""View Image Info""
This is the popup window that I saw:

The popup window indicates that the graphic was created at 11:22 PM of September 1st, implying that the original version of this Philippine Star article was published between 11:22PM and 11:59PM of 01 September 2016.

Hence, for the record, the original Star article was published after 11:00 PM of 01 September 2016.

2: Obuyes' Denial
According to his Facebook wall, Obuyes denial was posted on Facebook at 4:22 AM of 01 September 2016. Clicking the time stamp on that post shows a different time stamp: 4:22PM of 01 September 2016.


Whichever way it goes, it is clear that Obuyes' denial was issued on or before 4:22 PM of 01 September 2016.

For the record, this is what Obuyes wrote:
""to all my friends and relatives, ako man po ay nabigla at napasama po ako sa isyung ito, nung pinatawag po ko sa loob ng office ni sec. aguirre masaya po akong pumasok sa akala kung pipirma po ako ng bagong contract. pero laking gulat ko na ang inihain sa harapan ko ay bdo bank receipt amounting 24 million for the month of march and april 2014, kalakip ng mga pictures namin ni senator de lima. na yung time na yan nasa chr pa po ko. at ang pangalan ko dun ay bogs c obuyes, na imposible ko namang gamitin yun dahil nickname ko lang po un. sobra na tama na. maawa na sana sila kay sen.LML. ang laman ng statement ko po ay puro pag tatanggi na walang katotohanan ang lahat. pero bakit ang lumalabas ay against sen. de lima na ang statement ko. pls... pray for me and for our sen. LML.""

3: Mismatching Information
I have explained that the glaring spelling and grammatical errors show that it could not have possibly been leaked by DOJ. Aguirre has been successfully defending Duterte since time immemorial and it just goes to show how good a lawyer he is. Moreover, the date stamp 18 April 2014 would have automatically made the evidence invalid, as it was a bank holiday on that day.
Duterte eats court cases for breakfast with Aguirre as his metaphorical ""yaya"", so an error as glaring as this is impossible. Aguirre couldn't be that careless. It would have been possible if bar flunker Leni Robredo [TP: LNMB] was DOJ Chief , but she isn't.

In short, somebody else leaked it, and it's not with Aguirre's permission.

With that said, and assuming that Obuyes was indeed interrogated by Aguirre prior to the Star leak, Aguirre could not have possibly showed Obuyes the deposit slips.

Why? Because the deposit slips are questionable as it is, and it will just give Obuyes (and by extension, de Lima) more reason to attack Aguirre's credibility.

Surely, Aguirre doesn't want that. Bad evidence plus media coverage is bad for DOJ and Duterte.

Thus, I cannot help but ask:
How can Obuyes deny the deposit slips whose existence he should not have known about?
How convenient is it that just several hours later, the broadsheet published an exclusive on the the same exact deposit slips in question?
Now, these questions hinge on the assumption that Aguirre is a decent lawyer.

Besides, Aguirre wouldn't really need deposit slips as evidence because they have a direct line to the Anti-Money Laundering Council, which would have records of the 2014 transactions if they indeed exist [Abad].

Deposit slips as a lead? Yes.

But as evidence? No, not really.

However, some camps may still argue that Aguirre may have slipped, so I ask:
And why did Obuyes refuse Aguirre's request to undergo a polygraph (lie detector) test [GMA]?
How can Obuyes, a mere clerk and non-regular employee, have the guts to defy the sitting Justice Secretary?
Is he being protected by a ""higher power"", such as his former boss?

The Napoles Tactic

In May 2014, then-President Benigno Aquino III defended Cabinet members named in Janet Lim-Napoles extended affidavit, insinuating that the multiple copies of the list are meant to delay the investigation [Inq].

The Napoles Pork Barrel Scam has been fraught with controversy, as some of Aquino's cabinet members were implicated in some of the versions of the list. Included in one of the lists was former Budget Secretary Butch Abad, who allegedly taught Napoles how to set up foundations as funnels for pork barrel [TP: FOI].

In short, the group who leaked multiple ""Napolists"" might be the Liberal Party itself, in an attempt to confuse the public and allow them the opportunity to choose the version which best suits their party's interests.

And just recently, Duterte linked de Lima to the same Napoles case [Star].

This leads me to suspect someone is using the same tactic today.

And I have a pretty good idea who it is",RJ Nieto,"September 2, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/somethings-fishy-bogs-obuyes-and.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
#KungAkoSiRody: Sen. Leila De Lima liable for Inciting to Sedition?,"Dutertes controversial War on Drugs has riled international opinion, thanks to the efforts of former Justice Secretary and now Senator Leila de Lima.


On 31 August 2016, ultra-idealist United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, an influential voice in US Foreign Policy, tweeted:
Alarming reports of ongoing extrajudicial killings in #Philippines; government must respect human r(igh)ts & rule of law [Power].

Given sufficient backing from her peers, Power is not the kind of person who would think twice about urging the US to intervene in the Philippines.

Power, along with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and State Secretary Hillary Clinton, are the main culprits behind US President Barack Obamas decision to invade Libya to oust long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

What happened to Libya after the invasion?
Timothy Carney of the [Washington Examiner] wrote in 2014:
President Obama illegally invaded Libya, overthrew Moammar Gadhafi, and then  due to politics  left a power vacuum that terrorists filled, turning Libya into a hotbed of jihadist groups.
Simply put:
Gaddafi ruled over Libya and the US kicked him out. Today, instead of a dictator, Libya is now being ruled by terrorists.
Whats the point? Power pictures Duterte as another Gaddafi.

What gave Power the idea?
Simply put, if Power gets her way, this will be the situation in 2022:
Duterte ruled over the Philippines and the US kicked him out. Today, instead of what the US believes to be a dictator, the Philippines is now being ruled by drug cartels, terrorists, separatists, and the Grand Ole Oligarchy.
The Philippine opposition continuously failed, since 2009, to find evidence pinning vigilante killings on Duterte [TP: Ronnie Dayan]. This includes plus their failure to find the same in a recently concluded Senate investigation [TP: Destroy Duterte].

Despite this, the opposition has been drumming up international support over the past several months in its crusade to bring down the newly-installed populist anti-Oligarch President Rodrigo Duterte [TP: Oligarchy].

Members of the Philippine mainstream media can be largely credited for this increased international attention, as reporters of oligarch-owned or -controlled news outlets moonlight as wire reporters of international news agencies like AFP, AP, and Reuters. Foreign news outlets largely base their international news content on these wire reports.

A recent revelation, however, shows that Filipino wire reporters do not deserve all the credit for this international uproar: theres someone else.

Enter Senator De Lima
Aryeh Neier, President Emeritus of the Open Society Foundations and a founder of Human Rights Watch, has just written article ending with:
One prominent Philippine political figure, Leila de Lima, a senator and former justice minister, is already calling on the ICC to take action... The fact that a popular head of state is trampling the rule of law in the Philippines makes a fast, decisive response all the more necessary [ProjSynd].
No less than a founder of the Human Rights is calling for international action on the Philippines.
Yes, Neier is calling for foreign intervention, thanks largely to Senator Leila de Lima.

Just recently, De Lima spoke to CNNs Christiane Amanpour, where she further hammered in, despite the lack of evidence [TP: President Leni], her allegations of Dutertes complicity with the recent spate of extrajudicial killings [CNN].

The Liberal Partys General Strategy
Dutertes anti-corruption, anti-crime platform of government has ruffled, is ruffling, will ruffle a lot of feathers in the Liberal Party (LP), where Senator de Lima belongs.

It all started with Dutertes anti-illegal mining policies that hit LPs previously erstwhile invincible mining cronies [TP: Mining Cronies]. And now, with his massive war on drugs, Duterte  if not stopped  will cut off the alleged primary source of LP funding: the Drug Cartel [TP: Jesse Robredo].

Hence the viciousness of LPs attacks, with de Lima serving as their attack dog (or attack pig).
But then, Dog is a masculine word and Rapplers Prof. Sylvia Claudio is so particular about grammar [TP: Grammar Nazi], so let me oblige her by rewording the previous sentence.

Hence the viciousness of LPs attacks, with de Lima serving as their attack BITCH.

Prof. Claudio, are you happy now?

De Lima and her friends in the Liberal Party failed to destroy Dutertes campaign [TP: Tatang, TP: Jalosjos, TP: Scenarios]. They also failed to cheat him in the elections [TP: Smartmatic]. They also failed to impeach him [TP: Villar]. And so far, they have failed in rousing local public opinion over the EJK issue [TP: Gascon].

As you can probably see, the de Lima has run out of local options in as far as destroying Duterte, so she, along with former Liberal Party Director-General and Human Rights Chair Chito Gascon, decided to look elsewhere.

But theres a problem in this phase of the LP strategy. A big, legal, problem.

The Limits of Free Speech
A senator is part of the legislature, which is co-equal in power with the Executive. Thus, while I do not agree with De Limas actions prior to the International Criminal Court issue, I respect her right to express her dissent and her right use every remedy afforded to her by the Constitution.

Being the accuser with the burden of proof, de Lima blatantly ignored the need to discount the possibility of false or planted evidence, and proceeded with her campaign at destroying the countrys international reputation. Despite her full knowledge that she has no valid evidence against Duterte so far, she still decided to cross international political boundaries just to make things happen for her and her cohorts.


A Filipino democracy is where power is vested in the Filipino people [Dictionary], and the Filipino people decided to value Free Speech, and thats what de Lima purportedly exercises right now.

However, Free Speech does not confer an absolute right to speak or publish without responsibility whatever one may choose."" It is not ""unbridled license that gives immunity for every possible use of language and prevents the punishment of those who abuse this freedom [People vs Nabong].""

At this point, its clear that the Sovereign Will of the People favors Duterte. As a citizen and as a legislator, the best she is allowed to do is erode public opinion of Duterte and hope that things will go her way. She clearly realized that this wont happen, thats why she decided to seek foreign intervention, squarely circumventing the will of the real Philippine majority.
Inciting to Sedition

Lets be clear about this: De Lima wants ICC to intervene and the only way ICC can intervene is by putting the Duterte government under trial.

[Article 139 of the Revised Penal Code] states:
The crime of sedition is committed by persons (who) prevent any public officer from freely exercising his functions, or prevent the execution of any administrative order...
Meanwhile, [Article 142 of the Revised Penal Code] states:
Inciting to Sedition. - The penalty of prision correctional shall be imposed upon any person who, without taking any direct part in the crime of sedition, should incite others to the accomplishment of any of the acts which constitute sedition, by means of speeches, proclamations, writings or other representations tending to the same end
What do these imply?
If a representative of the ICC somehow manages to put Duterte on trial, its obvious the ICC would prevent Duterte, the President, from exercising his constitutional functions. That would be sedition.

Now, who incites ICC to sedition? De Lima, through her nonstop speeches against the Duterte administration, alleging that Duterte sanctions extrajudicial killings despite the lack of evidence of such.


Yes, the Aguirres DoJ can actually sue de Lima for inciting to sedition, and eventually have her placed behind bars, just like what de Lima to then-Senators Enrile, Revilla, and Estrada. The de Lima-Amanpour interview was not made during a Senate Session, so she cannot invoke parliamentary immunity.

#KungAkoSiRody: Political Considerations
At this point, ThinkingPinoy is not arguing anymore about whats morally right and whats morally wrong. I am now putting on my political observer hat, put myself in the Duterte administrations shoes, and evaluate my administrations prospects.

That is, I will pretend to be Duterte starting now.

I, President Rodrigo Duterte, can actually sue de Lima for inciting to sedition, but the reality is that there are other political factors to consider [TP: Game of Thrones].

First: Political Ammunition for the Opposition
The opposition can use de Limas prospective detention as political ammunition, similar to how the Manila Times counter-attacked the Arroyo administration after the latter sued them for the same [CMFR].

At this point, de Limas popularity is in the gutter, so why would I lift her up from where she is?

Second: De Lima the martyr""
Inciting to sedition will transform de Lima from a Senator into a political prisoner (i.e. a martyr), diverting attention from a more serious case  her alleged complicity with the drug trade  that would elicit far less international sympathy for her.

If I sue her right now, she can use the victim card and pretend to be the portlier version of Burmas Aung San Suu Kyi. I do not want that.

Third: Supreme Court ""cooperation""
Each Supreme Court Justice may have their own personal motives, but the fact remains that there is no real assurance that I will get a favorable verdict on the case. If I lose the case, this may become a political embarrassment that I may never recover from.

I can choose to file a case in 2019, when I have already appointed at least 10 justices into the High Court [TP: Supreme Court Math], so that will, at least slightly, tip the scales to my favor. However, 2019 is still far off, so it may be too late.

Proposed Course of Action
I, President Rodrigo Duterte, shall adopt the following plan:

First, stir controversy to buy a little time.
I will first stir controversy to make the public busy while I finish gathering evidence and preparing a case in connection with De Limas drug links. The driver-lover issue was enough to keep them busy for two weeks, the drug matrix two weeks, the works.

Second, file a drug-related case
A month should be enough to buy me enough time to file a case with Justice Secretary Aguirres help. If de Lima gets detained for drug-related offenses, theres a fair chance that she will lose her international voice. I am pretty confident that this can keep her locked in for good.

The regional trial courts are unlikely dismiss such a complaint for lack of probable cause because of two reasons: (a) I am not de Lima so I will not file a flimsy case and (b) these RTC judges have ambitions of becoming a Supreme Court Justice, and it just so happens that there are at least 10 available SC slots during my term.

Third, let the case drag on.
This doesnt require a lot of effort. Like every Filipino, I know it will take years before the drug-related de Lima case reaches the Supreme Court. And even if, by some miracle, the case does reach the court in four years, September 2020, where I would have appointed 10 justices in the Supreme Court, probably including the RTC judge who would convict de Lima.

Fourth, get insurance.
As an insurance against contingencies, I can file an inciting to sedition case to keep her behind bars. Yes, theres no way de Lima can get out of this scot-free.

And you know whats funny? I learned this strategy from them.

How? Because its the same thing they did to PGMA[TP:GMA Acquit].

The difference?

They didnt win, but I will.",RJ Nieto,"September 2, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/09/kungakosirody-leila-de-lima-inciting-sedition.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
How to destroy Rodrigo Duterte,"You hate Duterte, I get it. I do not respect the fact that you hate Duterte, but I respect your right to hate him. Believing that he still doesnt deserve to be the president despite a landslide win, you desperately want to bring him down. I get that too.

But over and over you fail, and I am starting to feel bad for you. Thats why this time, I am going to help you do exactly what you want to do.
A quick stroll down memory lane
Let me start by refreshing your memory about the first five attempts at destroying Rodrigo Duterte.

First, there was the P.I. Pope issue in November 2015. It didnt work because cursing is not a big deal for the poor masses where I belong [TP: Tatang], while the rich and middle class feel that there are more important issues to worry about.


Second, there was the Rape Joke issue [TP: Distasteful]. It didnt work because a foul-mouthed president is better than one who coddles rapists [TP: Jalosjos].

Third, there was the BPI Julia Vargas issue [TP: BangkoSerye]. It didnt work because Duterte has gained the Teflon effect [TP: Waiver Game], the evidence turned out to be double hearsay [TP: Sampalan], and the evidence contradicts itself [TP: Scenarios].

Fourth, there was the PCOS issue [TP: Smartmatic]. It didnt work because Dutertes lead is so large,  theres no way people will believe he wouldnt win and  the lead overwhelmed any potential cheating. Not for Bongbong Marcos, though [TP: Obsolete].

Fifth, there was Plan B, where Duterte would have been removed through impeachment. It didnt work as Duterte managed to secure 9 senator-allies, making the two-thirds majority required for conviction in an impeachment trial impossible to attain [TP: Mark Villar].

Five major attempts and so far, none worked. These painful and repeated failures have frustrated many people, to a point where they just throw in the disente towel and go full blast.

The Frustration of The Other Side
Rappler, the college sorority blog known for its hyper-opinionated bloggers [TP: Pia Raada], wont qualify as an example. Instead, I am talking about those who feigned impartiality in the past several months, only to amuse the public by crying like babies who saw Edgar Erices face.
Just look at erstwhile respectable Professor Walden Bello who was caught, pants down, calling 91% of Filipinos ignorant and stupid [Star, Minda] . He wasnt sorry for it and he gloriously succeeded, in the succeeding days [FB], to reinforce his newly-built reputation for assholery.

Then theres Al Jazeeras Jamela Alindogan who cheapened the deaths of fifteen soldiers [FB] in the war against the Abu Sayyaf by blaming it on Dutertes supposed misdecision. It appears Alindogan expects that the Abu Sayyaf will talk peace with Duterte over tea.


Yes, I chose to support Duterte in the May 2016 elections. However, theres a part of me that feels sympathy for the opposition that has been repeatedly trying its best to destroy the man and repeatedly failing miserably time and time again.

Thats why I am going to teach you how to destroy him, because I am starting to feel genuine pity for you guys.

SERIOUSLY.

Duterte the Murderer?
Youre trying to destroy Duterte again and this time, its the EJK issue.

You say Duterte is a mass murderer after the death of 2000 people during the war on drugs. Your ally, Sen. Leila de Lima, was so convinced of this despite her chronic failure to show  since 2009  Dutertes involvement in the Davao Death Squads [TP: Ooh, Ronnie!].

De Lima called for a senate investigation, and everybody she invited from the Duterte camp attended. Two days worth of grandstanding was fruitless, as not a single testimony, not a single piece of evidence, showed that Duterte ordered those deaths [TP: Chito Gascon].
Despite the lack of evidence, you still insist that he sanctions vigilante killings because you held him to his word. I think you will agree with TV5s Atty Mel Sta. Maria when he said in Filipino yesterday [Radyo5]:
President Duterte should be firm and say, Arrest all drug pushers, but he shouldnt say, I do not care about Human Rights (of criminals).
Adding Hontiveros statement that the presidents statements have the force and effect of policy, you are basically telling us that despite the lack of a formal announcement, his words against criminals de facto emboldened the police to kill suspects at will.

This kind of reasoning is problematic because it does not resonate with the masses.

Let me tell you why.

The Language of the Masses
Overanalyzing Dutertes statements wont work and the sooner you accept that reality, the better. I thought youve already learned that after the P.I. Pope scandal [TP: Tatang], but you didnt. I thought youve learned that after the Rape Joke scandal [TP:Jalosjos], but you havent.

We all speak Taglish, Duterte included. However, what mainstream media still doesnt get is that Duterte speaks Taglish that matches the wavelength of the masses, especially those who grew up poor, underprivileged, the whole nine yards. This is starkly different from the sanitized, prim-and-proper Taglish that most wealthy and highly-educated Filipinos (or those pretending to be such) use.
Luchi Cruz-Valdez brilliantly explained this point yesterday when she said [Radyo5]:
Nakuha niya (Duterte) kasi ang lenggwahe ng masa Kung likas kang Pilipino, tubong Pilipino ka lalo na grassrootsmage-gets mo pati jokes niya e nasasakyankaya ganoong kalawak ang mass base niya, really. Kasi nasasakyan nila, alam nila kapag nagjo-joke lang yan, alam din nila kapag, Oi, seryoso yan, alam din nila kung nagbo-borderline (offensive) siya.
[Translation: He speaks the language of the masses. If youre a common Filipino, especially if youre from the grassroots, youll catch the drift, even his jokes. Thats how he got his massive mass base, really. Because the masses understand him. They know when hes joking, they also know when hes serious, they also know when hes borderline (offensive).]
You know what, I actually think you do understand the language issue but you are still denying it. Yes, you have all the freedom to think whatever youre thinking. However, the fact remains that engaging the masses means having to play in their arena, not yours.

And what do you want? Sway their opinions to your favor.

Swaying Public Opinion
Theres one key concept here that you need to keep in mind: Public Opinion.

That is, if you want to destroy Duterte, you need to destroy his public image. If you want to destroy his public image, you have to be able to communicate with the masses. You should not just aim for the masses to hear you, you should make them listen to you.

We are not talking anymore about whats the morally right way to speak. Ill leave that to Rappler, the self-proclaimed morality police. Instead, I am talking about speaking in a way that people will actually listen.

And this how you do it:

First, stop pissing off the majority.
No, I am not talking about the self-proclaimed Silent Majority because 9% by no means constitutes a majority. I am talking about the 40% who voted for him, plus the 51% who decided to support him after he won. If you continue calling us idiots, ignoramuses, retards, and the like, you might as well look forward to six more years of teeth-gnashing and hair-pulling.

Second, stop nitpicking his statements.
Whether you think he really meant it or not doesnt matter: its how the masses interpret his statement that does. Instead of wondering why the masses are so clueless, you should ask why they caught his drift while you did not. Why? Making a big deal out of an otherwise simple statement will make the masses see you as a fool, and no one likes listening to fools.

Third, be sincere and straightforward.
The masses know you dont like Duterte so they would naturally be suspicious of everything you say. Just like in social media marketing, sincerity and empathy (or at least, what appears to be such) are the currencies of politics. People dont like talking to people that they feel they need to second-guess. Yes, your need to second-guess Dutertes words may be one of the reasons you didnt vote for him, but the tables have turned after May 9th. The 91% percents need to second-guess your statements will just make your job harder to do.

To make this easier to understand, lets apply these three tips to the EJK issue, your sixth and latest attempt to kick him out of the national scene.

Did Duterte order the ""murders""?
The extrajudicial killings (EJK) issue, the sixth and latest attempt, shows a lot of promise, if done right.

First, stop calling Duterte supporters names.
I am not against name-calling per se, but the truth of the matter is you cant convince someone to change sides if the first thing you do is piss him off [TP:Ed Lingao]. If you continue displaying disdain for Duterte supporters, then you are just wasting precious time, money, and saliva.

Second, stop using his statements against him.
We, his supporters, admit that he has a foul mouth, but we believe that he more than makes up for it with real, tangible, and substantial results.

Hence, use his actual actions instead. If you want to prove that Duterte is a mass murderer, show us that he actually ordered police to kill innocent people, or that he actually tolerated police abuses. You havent done that so far.

Third, stop telling us that youre on our side.
You are not fooling anyone. As a Duterte supporter, I would rather hear someone talk smack about me in front of my face rather than hear someone who spews bullshit. Duterte won because of the things he did, and not by the way he talks. Hence, to destroy him, show evidence based on the things that really did, and not based from the things he said.

Show us a policeman who killed an innocent but was subsequently pardoned. Give us a video or audio clip showing Duterte ordering cops to unlawfully kill people. Show us that saving a criminals life and saving our own lives are not mutually exclusive.

Why? Because you havent shown any of those so far.

ThinkingPinoys Bottom-line
I, ThinkingPinoy, am not a newsperson right now. I am just a lowly anonymous blogger who belongs to the masses. I am just a regular Filipino who writes about what I think. Nothing more and nothing less. I am not sure if youve been following my blog but I have read Facebook comments saying I have changed from a decent and courteous blogger to someone who writes incendiary posts almost every day. In short, I have allegedly become  an ""indencent"" blogger, whatever that means.

Why? Because I have run out of patience for dealing with people like you.

However, I am still trying to reach out to you because I want real opposition to the Duterte administration. And when I say real, I mean an opposition that actually makes sense to me and to the rest of the masses, not the kind of overreacting, self-entitled opposition that the country has today.

Now, if you still dont get what I mean, just avoid these 10 no-nos:
Do not do a [TP: Pia Raada], i.e. no superiority complex please.
Do not do a [TP: Paterno Esmaquel], i.e. no cyberbullying please.
Do not do a [TP: Albert del Rosario], no hidden motives please.
Do not do a [TP: Karen Davila], i.e. no deceitfulness please.
Do not do a [TP: Antonio Trillanes], i.e. no false evidence please.
Do not do a [TP: Leila de Lima], i.e. no hypocrisy please.
Do not do a [TP: Chito Gascon], i.e. no bullshit please.
Do not do a [TP: Aika Robredo], i.e. no unfounded claims please.
Do not do a [TP: Noynoy Aquino], i.e. no laziness and incompetence please; and most importantly,
Do not do a [TP: Leni Robredo], i.e. no ignorance please.

Because in as far as your political interests are concerned, doing any of these ten will do you more harm than good.

In reaction to this article, you may say:
That's too difficult!
That's too complicated! 
That's too unreasonable!
That's too numerous!
That's too unfair!
Well, that's your problem, not mine. It's you who needs something from the masses, and not the other way around. But if you manage to do all these, then alright, let's talk.",RJ Nieto,"August 31, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/08/how-to-destroy-rodrigo-duterte.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Mainstream vs Indie: Whos winning the PH social media wars?,"A few days ago, I posted a Facebook status update that compares Mocha Uson Blog page stats with those of the four major media outfits in the country. I was able to get the stats using Facebook Page Insights, an analytics tool thats freely accessible by anyone who owns a Facebook page.

To cut the long story short, I basically discovered that Mocha Uson is actually giving the four major networks (ABS-CBN, GMA, Inquirer, and Rappler) a run for their money in the social media game.


And so, I thought, why limit it to just five? Why not learn more about the social media wars by comparing all major networks with rising independent Facebook pages?

That is, who is dominating Facebook in the Philippines? And thats what we will try to answer.


Facebook versus TV
As of January 2016, there are 48 million Facebook users in the Philippines. Seventy-four percent are over the age of 19. Each Filipino spends 3 hours and 42 minutes on social media every day, as opposed to 2 hours and 33 minutes on television [WeAreSocial]. These figures translate to at least 35.52 million Filipino Facebook users of voting age. Yes, Facebook has become the primary battleground for shaping public opinion.
The methodology of this study is simple. I will analyze analytics data of several Facebook pages collected from Facebook Page Insights. The data used is based on the 7-day period starting from 23 August 2016.

The Facebook pages included in this study are those of mainstream news outlets and several independent politics-themed Facebook pages.

For this study, mainstream news outlet refers to pages whose content are supported by a fleet of editors and reporters, and are usually well-financed. Meanwhile, independent or indie news outlets are pages of independent bloggers, and usually work on reed-thin, often out-of-pocket budgets.

The 25 Facebook pages included in this study are:


Note that I included the custom URLs of each page to prevent confusing these pages with copycat or parody accounts. To visit any of these pages, just type facebook.com/ and append the corresponding custom URL.

Facebook Page Insights Stats
I logged on to my Thinking Pinoy Facebook account and took a video screencap of the data that will be used in this study:
I typed the data taken from the video above and arranged it into one neat table, as shown below:

For a given page, it appears that Facebook Page Insights calculate data from sample of the top 250 posts from the week-in-question. If a page has fewer than 250 posts, it calculates from the stats of all the posts.

Now, its time to do some harmless number-crunching. But first, let me explain how Facebook Influence can be measured.

Page Likes versus Page Engagement
Page Likes are important in helping a Facebook page gain a greater audience, the same reason why I celebrate whenever Thinking Pinoy reaches a certain number of total likes. The problem, however, is that page likes are not the be all and end all of social media practitioners.

Theres another extremely important metric: engagement.
Engagement refers to the total number of likes, comments, and shares. In the table in the previous section, the engagement this week column refers to the total number of likes, comments, and shares of the posts made during that period.

Let TP explain this through an example:
The national basketball team Smart Gilas Pilipinas is extremely popular, with 2.64 million likes as of 29 August 2016. Now, lets compare two posts.

A post from yesterday showing Gilas international rankings raked in 2,300 post likes, 38 comments, and 22 shares, i.e. approximately 2350 engagement. Meanwhile, A post from today showing an update about Ginebra, a regular PBA team, raked in 454 likes, 21 comments, and 1 share, i.e. approximately 470 engagement.

2350 vs 470? What do the differing engagement stats mean?

People liked the Smart Gilas page because they are interested in Smart Gilas. The first post gained greater engagement because its about Gilas while the second gained less because its not about Gilas.

Whats the point?

While Facebook page likes are important, engagement is more important because engagement shows how much influence a page exerts on its audience. Who needs a page with 10 million likes but has very few visitors?

Comparing Engagements
Engagement statistics is the primary point of contention in the social media wars, and this is probably the same reason why so much vitriol is being directed at blogger Mocha Uson, as stats show that she has greater engagement than most mainstream news sites.

The following table shows sites with highest engagement:



As we can see, the news giants ABS-CBN and GMANews are still on top, but its shocking to discover that Mocha Uson on 4th place, exceeding the respective engagement stats of CNN Philippines, Inquirer, TV5 and Rappler.

Yes, Mocha has over 400% more engagement than the college-sorority-blog-pretending-to-be-a-news-outlet Rappler.com.
Actually, four independent pages beat Rappler in terms of engaged user this week: Mocha Uson Blog, Duterte Today, Mindavote, and Lapu-lapu.

Maria Ressa and her Rapplerettes must be losing a lot of sleep lately.


Personally, I also found it interesting that ThinkingPinoy, maintained by a 1-man team (c'est moi~), has higher engagement than Interaksyon, ANC 24/7, PTV, and The Manila Times.

*Ehem*

Engagement per Post
Total engagement stats are important in gauging general influence, but its also important to know the average effectiveness of a given pages posts, and we measure this using the metric engagement per post. Engagement per post (EPP) is the measure of whether or not a pages content is interesting enough for its audience.

EPP is equal to the total number engagements divided by the total number of posts.

If a page's quality is defined as the ""interestingness"" of posts vis-a-vis the page's audience , then those with higher EPPs post higher-quality Facebook status updates.

Now, lets look at the pages with the highest EPP figures:
We can see that mainstream media TV show TV Patrols page has the highest EPP with 63,500. Whats surprising, however, is Mocha Uson Blog, whose EPP exceeds that of news giants ABS-CBN, GMA, CNN, Inquirer, and TV5.

Whats more shocking?

Indie pages Lapu-lapu, Duterte Today, ThinkingPinoy, and MindaVote, all of whom basically run on virtually no budget, has EPP rates that exceed Rappler, who received funding from investors like North Base Media and the Omidyar Network.

The times are changing, indeed. 

Engagement Rates 
Engagement Rate (ER) is a metric that social media marketers use to measure a brands effectiveness at engaging their audience. Basically, ER shows how many of your fans actually gave a damn about what you have posted.

ER is typically calculated by dividing total engagements by total reach, or the total number of people who saw a pages post [SimplyMeasured].


This formula is impossible to use in the context of this study, as Facebook reach statistics are not available in the Facebook Page Insights analytics tool.

Fortunately, there is an alternative formula for engagement rates where ER equals the total number of engagement over the total number of fans (a.k.a. page likes) [SimplyMeasured].

Heres the ER Top 15:

Despite drastically lower pages likes, Indie pages occupying six slots in the top 10. That is, these pages appear to offer more compelling (i.e. more engaging) content than most of their peers.

Sass Rogando Sasot, a newly-created page, has an astounding 593% engagement rate. Lapu-lapu is at 2nd with a shade below 300%, and ThinkingPinoy is 3rd with 224%.

Rappler is nowhere to be found in the top 15.

Growth Rates
Engagement growth rate (EGR) can give us an idea about the growth prospects of each page.  In the context of this study, Facebook's EGR is defined as the increased in engagements this week compared to last week.

Here's the EGR Top 15:


Over the past week, Sass Rogando Sasot enjoyed a whopping 161% increase in engagements. ThinkingPinoy and Lapu-lapu gained 15% and 9%, respectively.  This suggests that the three pages are still growing, i.e. they may receive more page likes than the rest.

Rappler, TV5, and many other major news outlets experienced less than 1% growth, suggesting that they may have already saturated their audience.


Essentially, this indicates that indie pages are growing rapidly, and mainstream media is now facing the prospect of obsoletion if they do not shape up.

Note, however, that the Sass Rogando Sasot page is barely a month old, while ThinkingPinoy is just 10 months old. This partly explains the growth stats, as there is still a large room for growth compared to the other pages that have been online for years.

ThinkingPinoy's takeaways
These numbers can be confusing, especially for those who hate Math.So let me give you a recap of what was discussed.
First, indie pages appear to offer more engaging content compared to mainstream pages.
Note, however,  that this has nothing to do with the veracity or truthfulness of what they post. This is why it is important for readers to verify information before believing what's written on their posts. This is the same reason why I meticulously insert hyperlinks and citations within every post in ThinkingPinoy, so I can let my readers read the sources for themselves and come up with their own conclusions.

Second, fans of indie pages are more passionate than fans of mainstream pages.
Imagine this: Mocha Uson has 4 million followers and 37.5% engagement rate while ABS-CBN has 11.7 million followers and a 16% engagement rate. If there were a People Power Revolution next week, which page is more likely to convince more people to join its cause?

Third, engagement numbers of indie pages are starting to rival mainstream pages.
The growth of indie pages generally outpace the growth of mainstream pages, suggesting that there might come a time when these indie pages may enter the mainstream and kick today's mainstream pages to the sidelines.  

For mainstream media, these three conclusions are alarming vis-a-vis the 2022 presidential elections to be held six years from now. By that time, there will be 48 million Filipino Facebook users whose political opinions may be shaped primarily by independent influencers.

Actually, that prediction might have already come true during the 2016 Presidential Elections where, despite the most vicious attacks from mainstream media (Remember the tasteless Trillanes-sponsored TV ad featuring kids?), the political outsider Rodrigo Duterte still managed to win by landslide.

Whether we want to admit it or not, Mocha Uson should be largely credited for Duterte's online dominance.

The rise of independent pages is the rise of independent thinking, where political commentators can speak their mind more freely than those who belong to mainstream organizations.

This is the first time in history that virtually any Filipino with a cheap smartphone can make his voice heard, with no editorial teams and no business interests to prevent him from doing so.

Indie pages, managed by regular people, now have a voice that can influence millions of Filipinos.

This is democracy at work.
 
Aika Robredo may not not very happy with it.

And apparently, Rappler too.


Ah, democracy, thou art a heartless b!tch.

Death and the PH Drug Industry: from China to the Streets,"This is the story of how Filipinos get shabulized, from start to finish.


The debate over Philippine President Rodrigo Dutertes war on drugs has been raging for at least two months now, with proponents of each side saying their approach is better than the other. The problem, however, is that no one has, so far, provided anyone a clear an comprehensive explanation about how the illegal shabu (meth) industry works.


Thus, in this article, ThinkingPinoy will explain the Shabu Business Process from supply, to manufacture, to distribution, to retail, and finally, to consumption, with the Philippine Shabu Market in mind.

The shabu business is just like any other manufacturing business that follows this basic process:

Almost everybody knows this. However, what many still dont understand is HOW EXACTLY this process works in the context of Philippine shabu, and explaining this process is what I will do.

Lets go.

Step 1: Supply
There are many ways to cook shabu, with the basic method using several nondescript ingredients, ethyl phenyl acetate, whose legality in the Philippines is still unclear to me, and one key precursor chemical: ephedrine.
Ephedrine is a controlled substance in the Philippines [PDEA]. One kilogram of ephedrine, after combining with other ingredients, can be converted into 750 grams of shabu [Inq].

Large-scale shabu cooking operations are usually the domain of drug cartels. When I wrote Dutertes Drug War, where is the logic in 400 Deaths?, I said there are at least 11 key players in the Philippine Shabu Industry:
The Sinaloa Drug Cartel, hailing from Mexico [MT]
Nine Chinese Drug Cartels, hailing from Mainland China [Star]
The African Drug Cartel, hailing from the Western African Continent [MT]

In 2014, it was discovered that the Hong Kong-based 14K and Sun Yee On triads (Chinese Cartel) supply raw materials for use in the Sinaloa cartels shabu laboratories in the Philippines [SCMP].

Hong Kong is part of China, and China is the No. 1 source of drugs in the Philippines [Inq]. Chinese cartels find it easy to smuggle shabu precursors into the country because the Philippines archipelagic nature provides lots of points of entry, and law enforcement was lax.

The government has identified three key persons who facilitate this process:
Wu Tuan, aka Peter Co
Peter Lim, aka Jaguar, protected by Ret. PNP Gen. Marcelo Garbo
Herbert Colangco, bilibid inmate and PMPC Star Awardee (LOL)
Yes, Colangco won the award WHILE IN PRISON.

Step 2: Manufacture
As long as you have ephedrine, manufacturing shabu is very easy: it does not require advanced training and all you need are household items that you can legally purchase from a supermarket, with the only major challenge being the ingredients flammability: a poorly-constructed, do-it-yourself shabu lab can explode [Inq].
Because cooking shabu is not very high-tech, setting up shabu labs is relatively easy. Hence, shabu labs have been found in many places in the Philippines, including:
Boats, e.g. the floating shabu lab found in Subic Bay [ABS]
Dug-up tunnels, e.g. the ones underneath the New Bilibid Prison [ABS. MT]
Abandoned houses, e.g. in Quezon City [Inq] or a posh village in Alabang [Inq]
Lets recap:
Chinese Cartels smuggle ingredients into the Philippines.
Various local shabu labs, including those owned by the Mexican Sinaloa cartel, cook shabu.
Alright, the shabu is ready, what comes next?

Step 3: Distribution
The shabu final product is ready, so how does it reach the streets? This is where the second step comes in: shabus movement from the shabu labs to the hands of retailers.

Manufacturer-to-dealer logistics is pretty straightforward. Whats complicated however, are two things:
Communication, i.e. coordination of their activities
Law Enforcement

Just like regular citizens, drug syndicates communicate through mobile phones and the internet. This is the same reason why the government was in shock when it raided the New Bilibid Prison a few years ago and discovered cellular signal boosters inside the jail compound [GMA].
It would have been easy for law enforcement agents to track the movements of these syndicates by tapping on their phone phone calls, but they are fraught with three key problems:

FIRST, wiretapped conversations are inadmissible as evidence in court per local laws [PCIJ]. This is the same reason why the Duterte cannot use as evidence the wiretapped conversation between Senator de Lima and her alleged driver-bodyguard-lover-bagman Ronnie Dayan, that was provided to him by foreign intelligence agents [GMA].


SECOND, SIM card registration is not required in the country [Inq], so drug dealers can simply toss an old SIM card, get a new one, and law enforcement agents who tap for leads will have to start all over.

THIRD, law enforcement agents themselves are involved in the drug trade [TP: PNP Generals; TP: Ooh Ronnie; TP: 400 Deaths]. LGU officials are also involved in it, making manufacturer-to-dealer logistics a lot, lot easier [TP: Mayors].

Alright, so the shabu is now in the local wholesale drug dealers hands, so what happens next?

Step 4: Retail
Wholesale drug dealers then hand over shabu to smaller scale drug pushers (retailer, tulak), similar to the relationship between a large insurance company and a lowly insurance agent.

But theres a major difference.

According to the US Justice Departments Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) [BJS 1992]:

A reputation for violence is the dealers best guarantee that his business transactions will be accomplished as agreed upon Those who do not pay what they owe can expect to be disciplined violently or killed Dealers often fail to pay because they were cheated or robbed or the drugs and/or money was confiscated by law enforcement.

When drug lords give a drug pusher shabu to sell on the streets, they expect that shabu to be sold entirely. Drug lords expect to be paid after a certain period and they do not accept returns. Drug lords kill street pushers who fail to meet their sales quota to strike fear on other street pushers. The fear motivates the surviving pushers.

You sell, or you die [ViceNews].

The fight against drugs is one of Dutertes core campaign platforms, and his well-publicized crackdown on shabu caused demand to go down.

For example, in June 2016, demand for narcotics dropped in Naga City in anticipation of the Dutertes 30 June 2016 inauguration [ABS].

A similar incident was report in the Cordilleras a month later, where Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA Regional Director Juvenal Azurin said in Filipino:
There may be fewer people who want to buy (shabu), or the dealers want the trade to be faster to avoid being caught and for some other reasons. [Star]

Again, what happens if a lowly drug pusher fails to meet his sales quota? He dies.

Step 5: Consumption
After a certain point, many shabu consumers or adiks (addicts) run out of personal funds to sustain their habit. This is when they resort to two things:
Stealing, which we are all-too-familiar with, or worse,
Becoming a drug pusher themselves.

Again, what happens when an addict-turned-pusher fails to meet his sales quota? He dies.

At this point, you now have a working idea about how large-scale shabu business works, but theres one more thing that we havent discussed yet: Expansion and Stabilization.

Step 6: Expansion-Stabilization 
Shabu is a business. And just like any other business, they seek to expand operations as soon as they have established their core operations (i.e. Steps 1 to 5).

So how do drug syndicates do this?

FIRST, by expanding overseas.

Sinaloa is the most powerful and influential drug syndicate in Mexico today.

Established in the mid-1990s, the Mexican Sinaloa Cartel first gained control of the Mexican state of Sinaloa, then expanded to five other Mexican States. Afterwards, it established operations across the United States. After dominating North America, it set up operations in South America, West Africa, and Europe [Chalk 2012].

After North America, South America, Africa, and Europe, where else would it go? Asia.

But where in Asia?
Alcohol in the Middle East (West Asia) is largely banned [Matthee 2014], so just imagine the penalties for shabu. 
North Asia is sparsely populated and the logistics is messy because of the lack of viable sea routes.
East Asia (Japan, China, and South Korea) have well-developed and draconian policies.
 South Asia has weaker governments, but the general population is too poor to afford shabu.

What's left? Southeast Asia, where law enforcement is lax and the economies are booming.

Drug smuggling in Southeast Asia has been on the rise in as early as 2012 [Globe].


In 2013, authorities confirmed that the dreaded Mexican Sinaloa Drug Cartel has arrived in the Philippines [ABS]. Just last year, PDEA operatives arrested Horacio Hernandez in Makati City. Hernandez is third in command to the Sinaloa Drug Cartel [Vice].

SECOND, by taking over territories.
When a drug syndicate enters a geographic area, its operations may encounter resistance from other drug syndicates who are already operating in the same territory. Overlapping operations of rival drug syndicates bring rise to turf wars, where rival syndicates kill each other off to gain new territory or to protect their own.
Lets see how the the Sinaloa Cartel works [DailyMail].

In 2015, Israel Hinosa revealed he killed members of rival drug cartels under orders from the top honchos of the Sinaloa Drug Cartel, for as little as $30 (Php 1,500) per assignment. He was addicted to heroin and crystal meth, and he would indulge in these drugs to numb post-assassination psychological trauma.

Hinosa was a sicario, a desperate individual who became ruthless killers for the narcotrafficking industry and in his case, for the Sinaloa Cartel. Sicarios were an integral part of the mass murders ensuing from the Sinaloa Cartels declaration war on the Juarez Cartel in 2007, where more than 20,000 people in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico lost their lives in the next five years.

Hence, we ask: Do we have sicarios in the Philippines?

Yes, we do [MB].

Lets watch the video clip shown below:

THIRD, they connive with law enforcement.
We all know this.

Drug dealers give payolas to police and local officials. 
Sometimes, even local officials run their drug rings. 
And most interestingly, some otherwise powerless people get into the business by f*cking the DOJ secretary [TP: Ooh... Ronnie... You're a very... very... bad... boy!].

And what happens when a lowly drug dealer wants to surrender or possibly become a state witness against a powerful government official? He dies.

Duterte's War on Drugs
Duterte previously asserted that most of the shabu in the Philippines come from Chinese Cartels whose base is, obviously, in China [SCMP]. Because he has zero authority over the China, he has to cooperate with the Chinese government in this regard. As to how the Chinese government will deal with is, is a totally different story.

This is the same reason why Duterte said, Hey, I have to invade a country to arrest the drug lords [Inq].

Given these, what can Duterte do?

Looking at Steps 1 to 5, we can see that while Step 1 might be out of the governments hands, the remaining steps are done within the country, i.e. within the governments jurisdiction.

This is the same drug apparatus that Duterte has been referring to [MB].

That is, even if the government exercises no power over the supply of raw materials, it still has power to destroy manufacturing plants, distribution facilities, retail networks and most importantly, the corrupt public officials who make all of them possible.

However, the disruption of shabus business process means death. As I have explained in the previous sections:
If a drug dealers fails to meets his quota, someone dies.
If a drug dealer wants to gain new territory, someone dies.
If he wants to protect his own territory, someone dies.
If he wants to turn himself in or become a state witness, someone dies.
No amount of government regulation will prevent drug dealers from killing other, precisely because they operate outside government control. And what's the only way to prevent them from killing each other? By stopping the drug war, but that also means we will be letting them kill the rest of the population instead.

Legalization of shabu? Of course not. The oft-cited Portuguese drug decriminalization is about cocaine and heroin, which work VERY DIFFERENTLY from shabu.

No, shabu decriminalization will not work either.

Besides, if decriminalization was even feasible, is that the executive's problem? It's the legislature who should be doing that. It is DE LIMA who should be doing that.

ThinkingPinoy's Takeaways

Dutertes war on drugs has been encountering opposition from local and international media, with the latter blaming the alleged drug-related deaths  even all of the vigilante killings  solely on the administration. The problem, however, is that mainstream medias reasoning is too simplistic, as it totally ignore the gruesome reality that I have just explained.

The recently concluded Senate Hearing on Extrajudicial Killings is a testament to that. We saw two days worth of grandstanding on the part of Senator Leila de Lima and CHR Chairman Chito Gascon, but not a single testimony or piece of evidence showing that the State itself sanctioned extrajudicial killings or even tolerated it [TP: Gascon; TP: Leni Robredo].

Mainstream media wants the killings to stop, but they provide no viable alternatives.

I guess mainstream media's oligarch owners simply cannot bear the idea that a common man with a heart for the people is now the most powerful Filipino... or are our mainstream journalists on the payroll of drug lords themselves?",RJ Nieto,"August 28, 2016",http://www.thinkingpinoy.net/2016/08/six-steps-on-how-to-be-drug-dealer-in.html,Thinking Pinoy,Fake
Who is CHR Chair Chito Gascon? [Part 1 of 2],"If you have been watching the Senate hearings on extrajudicial killings, youve probably noticed the presence of Jose Luis Martin Chito Gascon, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). With that said, there was something he said in the hearings that raised my eyebrows.


When asked about how many cases of policemen killed on duty the CHR is investigating, Gascons answer was one  case. To be fair, Gascon argued that the CHR usually handles cases against the government.

Per EO 163 s. 1987, CHR is tasked to investigate violations involving civil and political rights (CPR), or rights that generally restrict the powers of the government in respect of actions affecting the individual freedoms and opportunities for participatory governance [LincolnU].

Second nature
But policemen have CPRs too. If Gascon is so convinced that the President sanctions summary killings, wouldnt it mean that Duterte is trampling on the right to life of policemen that he would have been using as pawns?

With just 1 case out of 150 involving a dead cop, Gascon clearly doesnt see it that way.
I am usually snarky to people that I do not like, but I give lots of consideration for groups whom I believe are reasonably predisposed to act a certain way. Gascon, being the CHR chair, is expected to be far more passionate in advocating for human rights than a pedestrian like me. Hence, his eagerness over this particular senate investigation is something that I did not take against him.

Chito Gascon is the CHR chair for crying out loud! To fight for human rights is supposed to be second nature to him.

But before we go further, let me give you a quick rundown of what we learned from the two witnesses.

The Two Witnesses
Sen. De Lima interrogated two women whose family members are alleged victims of extrajudicial killings.

1st Witness: Harra Kazuo (Bertes)
The first witness, who identified herself as the 26-year-old Harra Kazuo, was the wife of suspected drug dealer JP Bertes and daughter-in-law of Renato Bertes. Pasay City cops killed the two Berteses on 07 July 2016. Harra admitted the following JP sold shabu in 2015 and bribed cops once with P10,000 in exchange for their silence. JP was already trying to quit drug dealing when Pasay cops raided their home and arrested JP and Renato some time before 07 July 2016. Harra learned of their death on 07 July 2016, with Pasay P/Supt. Nolasco Bathan claiming that the two tried to grab the cops firearms as they were about to be detained [Star].

2nd Witness: Mary Rose Aquino
The second witness, 23-year-old Mary Rose Aquino, is the eldest daughter of suspected drug dealer couple Rodelio and Rosalie Campos. Aquino admitted that her parents used and sold drugs sourced from Antipolo cops who, in turn, sourced them from police operations. One day, her parents left home to remit P50,000 pesos to the corrupt Antipolo City policemen. They never came back. They were murdered [Star].

An Duterte EJK Policy?
Everyone, regardless of political affiliation, will agree that this Senate Hearing on Extrajudicial Killings is aimed pinning the hundreds of murders in the past couple of months on President Duterte. Despite my personal political inclinations, I still am a curious political observer, so I find this senate investigation extremely interesting.
The murders discussed in the hearing are abhorrent and detestable, but its time to put things back to perspective.

Let us remember that the anger over the extrajudicial killings arises from the notion that summary killing has become President Dutertes policy. To prove this, at least one of the following conditions must hold:
Duterte formally order summary killings, or
Duterte tolerates abuses of law enforcement officers.

Now, lets apply this concept to the two testimonies.

Linking to Duterte
Both witnesses alleged that corrupt cops are cleaning up evidence as they eliminate their minions to prevent the latter from exposing their modus operandi. That is, corrupt cops are executing their drug assets to avoid incrimination [Star].

Hence, given the two conditions, the relevant question would be:
Did Duterte formally order those killings, or did Duterte tolerate the cops abuses?
First, did Duterte formally order those killings? The statement Kill drug dealers and Ill give you a medal, allegedly said by Duterte, is often used to justify the claim that he turned EJKs into official state policy. This is not true, as the complete statement was:

Feel free to call the police, or do it yourself if you have a gun In an arrest, you must overcome the resistance of the criminal. And if he fights (if) he fights to (the) death, you can kill him. Just follow that. Only if your life is in danger and the criminal is armed and hostile, shoot him, and I will give you a medal [TP: 400 deaths].


In short, Duterte never ordered summary killings, and neither of the witnesses statements suggested the same.

Second, did Duterte tolerate the cops abuses?
The Pasay City cops have already been charged with murder [Star], while the Antipolo cops have been relieved [GMA]. Way before the hearing, Duterte has even named and shamed police generals for their alleged links with the drug trade [TP: PNP Generals].

Hence, it is clear that in as far as the two testimonies are concerned, the president didnt tolerate EJKs.

In as far as the Senate Investigation is concerned, de Lima failed to show that the allegedly drug-related deaths are part of government policy.

The second day actually turned out to be free positive PR for PNP Chief Ronald Bato dela Rosa, as he charmed everyone with his honesty and dedication to his work. Bato even managed to secure the senators unsolicited promises to increase funding for salaries, firearms, patrol cars, fuel, training facilities, lawyers fees [MB].

Gascon insists on ICC Case
Yes, thats how persuasive Bato was on that day, and he was defending the police force as a whole the entire time. Unfortunately, despite the prosecutions failure to link the murders to state-sanctioned extrajudicial killings, it appears that Chito Gascon remained unfazed.

At the end of the second day, Gascon said the International Criminal Court (ICC) may possibly assume jurisdiction over the extrajudicial and vigilante killings of suspected drug dealers if the Philippine government fails to address the issue [Star].

So ThinkingPinoy tried to look for ICC guidelines related to Gascons claim.

According to an ICC document, the ICC can only exercise jurisdiction where national legal systems fail to do so, including where they purport to act but in reality are unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out proceedings [ICC].

Thus, I ask:

Wouldnt it be premature for Gascon to say the the government failed to address the EJK issue when the fact of the matter is that the new administration is barely two months old?
Has Duterte government prevented the judiciary from exercising its powers?
Has the Duterte government ignored even a single case of police abuse?

Quite the contrary actually, so why does Gascon insist on the ICC angle despite the absence of prerequisites?

Simply put, why the fear-mongering?

Jose Luis Martin Chito Gascon
Gascon is well educated and he benefits from the advice of CHRs fleet of lawyers so that ignorance of the law is unlikely. Hence, the logical question would be:
Could his decisions be affected by serious conflicts of interest?
To answer that, I researched Gascons past to have an idea of the man that he is right now.

Lets start.

Jose Luis Martin Chito Gascon arrived onto the national stage in 1986. Then the chairman of the University of the Philippines Student Council, he was among the first to heed the call of Cardinal Sins call to join the First EDSA Revolution [PCIJ].

Gascon was the youngest member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission that drafted the 1987 Constitution. Four years later, Congress named him as youth sector representative, giving him a direct hand in crafting the countrys laws [PCIJ].

For much of the 1990s and 2000s, I didnt see anything controversial or blatantly questionable about him. He graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Law in 1996, and received a Masters in International Law from Cambridge University in London a year later [LinkedIn].

Then I stumbled upon 2009.
